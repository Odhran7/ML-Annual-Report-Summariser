coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

• spherical lenses including lenses that correct near and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects 

• toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that in addition to correcting near and farsightedness address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism myopia and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea myopia management contact lenses slow the progression of myopia in children 8 to 12 years of age at initiation of the treatment 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse lenses and frequent replacement frp lenses which are designed for twoweek and monthly replacement 

coopervision offers spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision uses different manufacturing processes primarily cast molding to produce its lenses we believe this allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

• producing high medium and low volumes of lenses made with a variety of materials for a broader range of market niches singleuse twoweek and monthly disposable sphere toric and multifocal lenses custom toric lenses for patients with a high degree of astigmatism and myopia management contact lenses 

• offering a wide range of lens parameters leading to a higher rate of successful fitting for practitioners and better visual acuity for patients 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new valueadded products such as spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices and add aspherical optical properties andor higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels and myopia management contact lenses for 8 to 12 years ageappropriate children 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business silicone hydrogel lenses represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity ® brand is coopervisions leading product line in terms of sales under the biofinity brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical including biofinity energys ®  toric extended range toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products 

coopervision markets singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses with a complete line of spherical toric extended range toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti ® 1 day brand and singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lenses under our myday ® brand we also compete in the traditional singleuse hydrogel product segment with branded lenses including our proclear ® and biomedics ® 1 day lenses we believe the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that our competitive silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel product offerings represent an opportunity for our business 

in addition to its silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with other traditional hydrogel products 

coopervision focuses on supporting the growth of all customers including key accounts optical chains global retailers certain buying groups and mass merchandisers by investing in selling promotional and advertising activities further we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue providing quality service with our industry leading sku range and customized offerings 

coopervision believes that myopia management opens up an attractive new market for contact lenses with misight coopervision offers the only fda approved 1 and first chinese nmpa approved product to control the progression of myopia in ageappropriate children coopervision is investing to create this new market by educating eye care practitioners patients and their families which increases awareness 

coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets both organically and through acquisitions in fiscal 2022 coopervision acquired a privatelyheld denmarkbased orthok contact lens distributor in fiscal 2021 coopervision acquired a privatelyheld medical device company and a privatelyheld uk contact lenses manufacturer these acquisitions expanded coopervision’s specialty eye care portfolio and its leadership in addressing the increasing severity and prevalence of myopia 

1 indications for use of misight® 1 day omafilcon a soft hydrophilic contact lenses for daily wear are indicated for the correction of myopic ametropia and for slowing the progression of myopia in children with nondiseased eyes who at the initiation of treatment are 812 years of age and have a refraction of 075 to 400 diopters spherical equivalent with ≤ 075 diopters of astigmatism the lens is to be discarded after each removal

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon inc and bausch health companies inc 

certain of coopervisions competitors may have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects including laser vision correction coopervision believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products clariti 1 day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses myday ® singleuse spherical toric and multifocal lenses biofinity monthly spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lenses and avaira vitality ® twoweek spherical and toric lenses coopervision believes the clariti 1 day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market coopervision offers both branded and private labelstore brand options in contact lenses its private label option is frequently offered as part of a larger customized solution for its customers it also competes in the specialty contact lens space with its fda approved misight 1 day contact lens for myopia management in ageappropriate children as well as orthok and scleral lenses 

in addition to a broad offering of silicone hydrogel and specialty contact lenses coopervision competes with different manufacturing processes which allow it to produce a broad range of spheres toric and multifocal lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low

market for womens and family health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for womens and family health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics in recent years including with the acquisition of generate in fiscal 2022 coopersurgical’s business increasingly includes marketing and selling to end consumers of healthcare technology and reproductive planning products and services 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to women’s health provider offices in the us to increase over the next decade from adolescent care to geriatrics there is increasing global awareness of women’s health issues during the reproductive years fertility awareness and family planning and healthcare are key areas of focus the attention in maternity care to improving access to safe effective and equitable obstetrical care continues as we expect an increase in the population of women over the age of 65 office visits focused around abnormal bleeding incontinence and menopause will likely increase 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the continued migration of obgyn health care professionals away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this overall trend of consolidation of healthcare systems includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement across these caredelivery systems coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

recent trends of patientcentered valuebased care include the development of more costeffective health care delivery models including moving treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect to see continued changes in reimbursement and clinical best practices as payment models and policies continue to evolve

government regulation 

medical device regulation in the united states 

most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the us and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage record keeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

wish to distribute commercially in the us will require either premarket notification to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes—class i ii or iii—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices subject to different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are devices with the lowest risk and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation qsr facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are moderate risk devices which are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and amendments to the fda reauthorization act mdufa iv unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions require payment of user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to substantially higher user fees under mdufa iv than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a class i or class ii device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device a predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a pma a device that was legally marketed in commercial distribution in the us before may 28 1976 a preamendments device and for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of a pma a device that has been reclassified from class iii to class ii or i or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510k premarket notification process the fda aims to make substantial equivalence determinations following receipt of a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires additional information to support substantial equivalence if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate the device is automatically designated as a class iii device the device sponsor must fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or depending on the modification pma approval or de novo classification the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda may require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or until premarket approval is obtained or a de novo classification request is granted in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

over the last several years the fda has proposed reforms to its 510k clearance process and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510k clearance process for their products for example in november 2018 fda officials announced steps that the fda intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under section 510k of the fdca among other things the fda announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510k pathway toward the use of newer predicates these proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510k clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted 

in september 2019 the fda published updated guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain wellunderstood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510k clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the fda thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process the fda maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop productspecific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type as well as recommended testing methods where feasible 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures or if the device has been previously classified as class iii unless otherwise 510k exempt the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical nonclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

following receipt of a pma application the fda conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review if it is not the agency will refuse to file the pma if it is the fda will accept the application for filing and begin the review the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data nonclinical data or clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicants response to deficiencies communicated by the fda the fda considers a pma or pma supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an fda request for information eg major deficiency letter within 180 days after the fda issues such request also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr which among other things requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval the fda may also condition approval of a pma application on some form of postmarket surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use in such cases the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the fda on the clinical status of those patients failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the pma process pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a pma application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials for medical devices 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required to obtain clearance of a 510k premarket notification these trials may require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda depending on the device if the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health then the device sponsor is not required to submit an ide application to the fda before initiating human clinical trials but must still comply with abbreviated ide requirements when conducting such trials a significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted used in supporting or sustaining human life substantially important in diagnosing curing mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject if the device presents a “significant risk” to human health the sponsor must submit an ide application to the fda and obtain ide approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials the ide application which includes a clinical study protocol must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks to human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless the fda notifies the company that the investigation may not begin if the fda determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an ide for which it requires modification the fda may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval 

regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device clinical studies must be approved by and conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board irb for each clinical site the irb is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the study and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation of medical devices 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations which require changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections for cause by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements which are subject to new legislation and change can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

we provide certain genetic testing laboratory services in the us under the fdca and the fda’s regulatory framework in vitro diagnostic devices ivds are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases such as cancer or other conditions the fda considers laboratory developed tests ldts to be a subset of ivds which are intended for clinical use and are designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced certain applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to certain ldts 

even under its current enforcement discretion policy the fda has issued warning letters to ivd manufacturers for commercializing laboratory tests that were purported to be ldts but that the fda alleged failed to meet the definition of an ldt or otherwise were not subject to the fda’s policy on enforcement discretion over ldts because they presented a potential safety risk or because they were marketed directly to consumers without the involvement of a health care professional additionally the fda could change its policy of enforcement discretion for ldts even without legislation for example in recent years the fda has stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to ldts specifically on july 31 2014 the fda notified congress of its intent to modify in a riskbased manner its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts on october 3 2014 the fda issued two draft guidance documents entitled “framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests ldts” or the framework guidance and “fda notification and medical device reporting for ldts” or the reporting guidance the framework guidance stated that fda intended to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts in a riskbased manner consistent with the classification of medical devices generally in classes i through iii the reporting guidance would have further enabled the fda to collect information regarding the ldts currently being offered for clinical use through a notification process as well as to enforce its regulations for reporting safety issues and collecting information on any known or suspected adverse events related to the use of an ldt the fda halted finalization of this guidance in november 2016 to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach for ldts and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution in january 2017 the fda issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to ldt regulation 

legislative and administrative proposals proposing to amend the fda’s oversight of ldts have been introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will continue to be introduced from time to time for example key congressional committees with jurisdiction over fda matters have indicated an interest in continuing negotiations on potential legislation regarding ldts in march 2020 the valid act was introduced in the house and an identical version of the bill was introduced in the us senate if passed in its current form the valid act would create a new category of medical products separate from medical devices called “in vitro clinical tests” or ivcts as proposed the bill would establish a riskbased approach to imposing requirements related to premarket review quality systems and labeling requirements on all ivcts including ldts but would create exemptions for certain ldts marketed before the effective date of the bill though other regulatory requirements may apply such as registration and adverse event reporting in june 2021 a revised version of the valid act was reintroduced in both the house and the senate it is unclear whether the valid act or any other legislative proposals including any proposals to reduce fda oversight of ldts would be passed by congress or signed into law by the president depending on the approach adopted under any potential legislation certain ldts could become subject to some form of premarket review potentially with a transition period for compliance and a grandfathering provision 

if congress does not take action in connection with the valid act or other ldt legislation it is possible that the fda could change its regulatory policy governing ldts in a way that could require that our currently marketed genetic tests and any future products that we anticipate marketing as ldts comply with certain additional fda requirements 

as we operate a genetic testing laboratory we are required to hold certain federal state and local licenses certifications and permits to conduct our business under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or clia we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations including test processes personnel facilities administration equipment maintenance recordkeeping quality systems and proficiency testing we have current certification under clia to perform testing at our new jersey facility to renew our clia certificate we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards the regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time and any such changes could have a material effect on our business penalties for noncompliance with clia requirements include suspension limitation or revocation of the laboratory’s clia certificate as well as a directed plan of correction state onsite monitoring civil money penalties civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties 

in addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under clia licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under state law such laws establish standards for the daytoday operation of a clinical reference laboratory including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control in addition state laws mandate proficiency testing which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory in addition certain states require licensing of outofstate laboratories in order to receive and test specimens from those tests if a laboratory is out of compliance with such statutory or regulatory standards the state may suspend limit revoke or annul the laboratory’s license censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties

fda regulation of hctps 

we currently operate a provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage donated reproductive tissue eggs or sperm are regulated by the fda as human cells tissues and cellular and tissuebased products hctps in addition section 361 of the public health service act phsa authorizes the fda to issue regulations to prevent the introduction transmission or spread of communicable disease with respect to hctps hctps regulated as “361 hctps” are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the fda and stringent requirements for processing storing labeling and distributing hctps including required labeling information screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility record keeping and adverse event reporting among other applicable requirements and laws 361 hctps do not require 510k clearance pma approval submission of a biologics license application or other premarket authorization from the fda before marketing however to be regulated as a 361 hctp the product must among other things be “minimally manipulated” which for structural tissue products means that the manufacturing processes do not alter the original relevant characteristics of the tissue relating to the tissue’s utility for reconstruction repair or replacement and for cells or nonstructural tissue products means that the manufacturing processes do not alter the relevant biological characteristics of cells or tissues a 361 hctp must also be intended for “homologous use” which refers to use in the repair reconstruction replacement or supplementation of a recipient’s cells or tissues with an hctp that performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor hctps that do not meet the criteria of section 361 are regulated under section 351 of the phsa unlike 361 hctps hctps regulated as “351 hctps” are subject to premarket review andor approval by the fda as required we believe our hctps are regulated as 361 hctps 

pharmaceutical regulation in the united states 

fda has determined that the primary mode of action for paragard is the drug component and is therefore regulated by fda’s center for drug evaluation and research as a drug product 

in the us the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications nda withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold untitled letters warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 

any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including manufacturing periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising promotion drug shortage reporting compliance with any postapproval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as phase 4 clinical trials a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and surveillance recordkeeping and reporting requirements including adverse experiences 

after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to further testing to new clinical investigation requirements and prior fda review and approval there also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices or cgmps and other requirements which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our thirdparty manufacturers 

changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented or fda notification fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmps specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any thirdparty manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations imposition of postmarket studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program among other consequences 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the fda closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda physicians in their independent professional medical judgement may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda we however are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling in addition the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products including samples is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution the drug supply chain security act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and serialization 

failure to comply with any of the fda’s requirements which are subject to new legislation and change could result in significant adverse enforcement actions these include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as refusal to approve pending applications license suspension or revocation withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials warning letters untitled letters cyber letters modification of promotional materials or labeling product recalls product seizures or detentions refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution debarment injunctions fines consent decrees corporate integrity agreements refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment it is also possible that failure to comply with the fda’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws as well as state consumer protection laws any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity among other adverse consequences 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical studies and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the us the regulatory agencies or notified bodies in other countries must approve or certify new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval or certification in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union eu us canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements coopervision maintains iso 13485 certification and ce marks for its products and coopersurgical maintains iso 13485 certification for medical devices and iso 15189 certification for the genomics laboratories the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

regulation of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the european union 

the eu has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design manufacture clinical investigations conformity assessment labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices including ivds 

in the eu until may 25 2021 medical devices were regulated by the council directive 9342eec the eu mdd which has been repealed and replaced by regulation eu no 2017745 the eu mdr similarly until may 25 2022 ivds were regulated by directive 9879ec the eu ivdd which has been repealed and replaced by regulation eu 2017746 of the european parliament and of the council the eu ivdr however on october 14 2021 the european commission proposed a “progressive” rollout of the eu ivdr to prevent disruption in the supply of ivds the european parliament and council adopted the proposed regulation on december 15 2021 the eu ivdr became applicable on may 26 2022 but there is a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices depending on their risk classification before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation unlike directives regulations are directly applicable in all eu member states without the need for member states to implement into national law both regulations were adopted to establish a modernized and more robust eu legislative framework with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

our current certificates have been granted under the eu mdd and the eu ivdd devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the eu mdd prior to may 26 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until may 26 2025 provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled in particular the certificate in question must still be valid similarly with respect to ivds they may generally continue to be made available provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled however respectively as of may 26 2021 and may 26 2022 some of the eu mdr and eu ivdr requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the former directives with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices postmarket surveillance and vigilance requirements pursuing marketing of medical devices including ivds in the eu will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regimes set forth in the eu mdr and the eu ivdr when our current certificates expire 

both the eu mdr and the eu ivdr seek to 

• strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available 

• establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

• establish explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities 

• impose an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation 

• improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk 

• set up a central database eudamed to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu and 

• strengthen rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices that may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market 

in the eu there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices including ivds however all medical devices including ivds placed on the eu market must meet general safety and performance requirements  including that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that during normal conditions of use it is suitable for its intended purpose medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and where applicable other persons provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art 

compliance with the general safety and performance requirements is a prerequisite for european conformity marking ce mark without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the eu to demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i or general ivds class a where the manufacturer can selfassess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements except for any parts which relate to sterility metrology or reuse aspects of a medical device a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body notified bodies are independent organizations designated by eu member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market a notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards—iso 134852016 for quality management systems—conform to these requirements if satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the general safety and performance requirements the notified body issues a certificate of conformity which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity the manufacturer may then apply the ce mark to the device which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the eu 

throughout the term of the certificate of conformity the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements in particular there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificates 

all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the eu must comply with the eu medical device vigilance system under this system serious incidents and field safety corrective actions fscas must be reported to the relevant authorities of the eu member states manufacturers are required to take fscas to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market an fsca may include the recall modification exchange destruction or retrofitting of the device 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth by eu directives only devices that are ce marked may be marketed and advertised in the eu in accordance with their intended purpose directive 2006114ec concerning misleading and comparative advertising and directive 200529ec on unfair commercial practices while not specific to the advertising of medical devices also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules for example requiring that advertisements are evidenced balanced and not misleading specific requirements are defined at the national level eu member states laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices which vary between jurisdictions may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals 

in the eu regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and if necessary unannounced inspections of companies as well as suppliers andor subcontractors and where necessary the facilities of professional users failure to comply with regulatory requirements as applicable could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions as appropriate regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions including untitled or warning letters fines consent decrees injunctions or civil or criminal penalties 

regulation of laboratory developed tests in the european union 

in the eu laboratory developed tests ldts are exempt from the regulations that govern medical devices and ivds under certain conditions according to the former article 15 of the eu ivdd “this directive shall not apply to devices manufactured and used only within the same health institution and on the premises of their manufacture or used on premises in the immediate vicinity without having been transferred to another legal entity” article 15 further provided that this exemption did not affect the right of an eu member state from imposing “appropriate protection requirements” in order to fall within this exemption under the eu ivdd medical devices including laboratory developed tests had to be designed and used within such health institution which may include hospitals laboratories and public health institutions that support the healthcare system andor address patient needs but do not treat or care for patients directly on a nonindustrial scale without being released into the market however the legal framework for applying the exemption under the eu ivdd to laboratory developed tests was not entirely clear as the eu ivdd did not specify what nonindustrial scale would be 

since the eu ivdr became applicable it may provide greater clarity on the regulation of ldts under the eu ivdr the general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i of the eu ivdr are also applicable to devices manufactured and used only within health institutions manufacturers of such devices are required to demonstrate conformity with the general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i of the eu ivdr through performance evaluations in accordance with article 56 of the eu ivdr and the manufacturer’s quality management system framework 

the eu ivdr provides that the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i of the eu ivdr do not generally apply to devices manufactured and used only within health institutions established in the eu provided that the conditions set out in article 5 of the eu ivdr are met under the eu ivdr health institutions may manufacture modify and use medical devices within such institutions thereby addressing the specific needs of target patient groups on a nonindustrial scale under such circumstances where the ldts are manufactured and used strictly within health institutions which may include hospitals laboratories public health institutions that support the healthcare system andor address patient needs but do not treat or care for patients directly ldts would continue to be exempt from regulation however compared to the previous regulatory regime the exemptions for ldts have overall been narrowed as even in relation to ldts health institutions among others are required to provide information upon request on the use of such devices to their competent authority and each health institution will have to draw up a declaration which it will make publicly available if these conditions are not met andor diagnostic tests are manufactured and used only within health institutions but “on an industrial scale” such tests will qualify as ivds with the full applicability of the eu ivdr ldts regulated by the eu ivdr are subject to conformity assessments and inspections by the relevant competent authority who will also review the declarations and statements made by the health institutions in relation to their ldts our current and future tests will need to be analyzed as to whether any or all of them would qualify for an exemption under article 5 of the eu ivdr or otherwise we will be required to comply with various certification and documentation criteria and we may be subject to conformity assessments and inspections 

the aforementioned eu rules are generally applicable in the european economic area eea which consists of the 27 eu member states plus norway liechtenstein and iceland 

the impact of brexit 

following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the uk the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and following the expiry of the brexit transitional period on december 31 2020 the uk now operates under a distinct regulatory regime and certain eu laws now only 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

apply to the uk in respect of northern ireland as laid out in the protocol on ireland and northern ireland the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra is now the uk’s standalone regulator although the uk and eu have now reached an agreement on its future trading relationship implemented in the euuk trade and cooperation agreement from january 1 2021 or the tca the agreement does not cover all regulatory areas regarding medical devices including ivds which may be subject to future bilateral discussions going forward and could further change the relationship between the uk and the eu in this regard 

eu laws which were directly applicable before the end of the transitional period or have been transposed into uk law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained eu law” however new legislation such as the eu mdr and eu ivdr will not be applicable the uk government has introduced a new medicines and medical devices act which seeks to address regulatory gaps through implementing regulations and delegated powers covering the fields of human medicines clinical studies of human medicines and medical devices 

significantly under the tca there is no mutual recognition of regulatory regimes and certifications between the eu and the uk postbrexit amendments have been made to the existing uk medical devices legislation which require medical devices to be registered with the mhra before being placed on the great britain market manufacturers based outside of the uk need to appoint a uk responsible person to register devices with the mhra following a government consultation on changes to the uk’s medical device regulations the response to which was published on june 26 2022 it is anticipated that amendments to the legislation will soon be published by the government and should become applicable by july 1 2023 so that medical devices placed on the market in great britain england scotland and wales will require a uk conformity assessment ukca mark however within the government’s consultation response it has proposed that transition periods will be included in the revised legislation so that products with existing and valid conformity assessments ce mark or ukca mark could continue to be placed on the great britain market for a maximum of 35 years after july 1 2023 depending on which legislation the medical device has been certified under ivds with valid certification can continue to be placed on the market until the earlier of certificate expiry or for a period of five years following publication of the new regulations however ukca marking alone will not be recognized in the eu the rules for placing medical devices on the northern ireland market will differ from those in the great britain these modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to conduct our business in these countries 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral false claims laws and physician payment transparency laws and regulations 

in the us the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving any remuneration directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for the purchase lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the antikickback statute instead the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a casebycase basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances in addition a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

the federal physician selfreferral prohibitions commonly known as the stark law generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the medicare or medicaid programs for certain designated health services including clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service or any member of such physician’s immediate family has a financial interest such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition these prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral 

the federal false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute or stark law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims act 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control or custody of any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by trick scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation also many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs or in several states apply regardless of the payor 

in addition the federal government as part of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals and teaching hospitals as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians as defined by statute and their immediate family members certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws 

in the eu many member states have adopted specific antigift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices including ivds in particular visàvis healthcare professionals and organizations additionally there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities in addition many eu member states have adopted national “sunshine acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements often on an annual basis similar to the requirements in the us on medical device manufacturers certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs 

violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including fines and civil monetary penalties the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements which impose among other things rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies similar sanctions and penalties as well as imprisonment also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies 

coverage and reimbursement 

market acceptance and sales of our coopersurgical products to our customers who primarily consist of hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics will depend on the availability of payor coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement for the procedures using our products by government insurance programs and other thirdparty payors payor coverage and reimbursement for procedures using medical devices in the us and international markets vary significantly by country 

in the us our currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in surgical procedures and if covered by thirdparty payors are paid for as part of the procedure outside of the us there are many reimbursement programs through private payors as well as government programs in some countries government reimbursement is the predominant program available to patients and hospitals our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities private health insurers and other thirdparty payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used failure by physicians hospitals surgery centers fertility clinics and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in government and private thirdparty payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies 

we believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services all thirdparty reimbursement programs are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring second opinions prior to major surgery careful review of bills encouragement of healthier lifestyles and other preventative services and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare in addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels thirdparty payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts this includes routine updates to payments to physicians hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used these updates could directly impact the demand for our products 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

with respect to drug coverage and reimbursement thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and costeffectiveness of drugs in addition to their safety and efficacy adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit sales of paragard or any other drug product that receives approval thirdparty payors may not consider our products to be medically necessary or costeffective compared to other available therapies or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development additionally decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product 

in international markets including the eu reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures there can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be covered for a specific indication that our products will be considered costeffective by thirdparty payors that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the thirdparty payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably for example in the eu member states impose controls on whether products are reimbursable by national or regional health service providers and on the prices at which devices are reimbursed under staterun healthcare schemes more and more local product specific reimbursement law is applied as an overlay to medical device regulation which has provided an additional layer of clearance requirement 

healthcare reform 

in the us there has been and continues to be several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect the profitable sale of product candidates 

among policy makers and payors in the us there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs improving quality andor expanding access passed in march 2010 the aca substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the pharmaceutical medical device and clinical laboratory industries among other things the aca increased the minimum level of medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 151 to 231 required collection of rebates for drugs paid by medicaid managed care organizations required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer pointofsale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d imposed a nondeductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled infused instilled implanted or injected expanded eligibility criteria for medicaid programs created a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research and established a center for medicare  medicaid innovation at the cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending potentially including prescription drug spending 

since its enactment there have been judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the aca on june 17 2021 the us supreme court rejected a challenge by a group of states and individuals to the constitutionality of the aca 

moreover there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products most recently on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022 or ira was signed into law among other things the ira requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with medicare beginning in 2026 with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap imposes rebates under medicare part b and medicare part d to penalize price increases that outpace inflation first due in 2023 and replaces the part d coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program beginning in 2025 individual states in the us have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing in addition regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs furthermore there has been increased interest by thirdparty payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices 

in foreign countries where we market our products recent healthcare reform has taken place as well for instance in december 2021 the eu regulation no 20212282 on health technology assessment hta amending directive 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

201124eu was adopted this regulation which became effective in january 2022 intends to boost cooperation among eu member states in assessing health technologies including some medical devices and providing the basis for cooperation at the eu level for joint clinical assessments in these areas the regulation foresees a threeyear transitional period and will permit eu member states to use common hta tools methodologies and procedures across the eu working together in four main areas including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from hta authorities identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas individual eu member states will continue to be responsible for assessing nonclinical eg economic social ethical aspects of health technologies and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement 

we expect that additional state federal and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that state federal and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures

numerous state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of personal information including healthrelated information in the us numerous federal and state laws and regulations including data breach notification laws health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners for example the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 and regulations implemented thereunder collectively hipaa imposes privacy security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers health plans and health care clearinghouses known as covered entities as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating receiving maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities entities that are found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance further entities that knowingly obtain use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a hipaa covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by hipaa may be subject to criminal penalties 

even when hipaa does not apply according to the federal trade commission ftc violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section 5a of the federal trade commission act the ftc expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities 

in addition certain state and nonus laws such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr govern the privacy and security of personal data including healthrelated data in certain circumstances some of which are more stringent than hipaa and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect thus complicating compliance efforts failure to comply with these laws where applicable can result in the imposition of significant civil andor criminal penalties and private litigation for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things creates data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides certain privacy rights to california residents including the right to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach further the california privacy rights act cpra which will go into effect on january 1 2023 significantly amends the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses including additional consumer rights processes limitations on data uses new audit requirements for higher risk data and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data it will also create a new california data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement in europe the gdpr went into effect in may 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data in the context of an establishment in the eea or the processing of personal data of individuals within the eea the gdpr imposes comprehensive data privacy compliance obligations in relation to collection processing sharing disclosure transfer and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual or “personal data” including a principal of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies procedures training and audit in addition the gdpr increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from the eea including clinical trial sites located in the eea to the us and other jurisdictions that the european commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu cjeu limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the eea to the us by invalidating the euus privacy shield and imposing further 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the eea indeed while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place subsequent european court and regulator decisions have taken a restrictive approach to international data transfers 

companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant undertaking whichever is greater 

additionally following the uk’s withdrawal from the eu and the expiry of the transition period companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the uk national law the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of annual global turnover the european commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the uk enabling data transfers from eu member states to the uk without additional safeguards however the uk adequacy decision will automatically expire in june 2025 unless the european commission reassesses and renewsextends that decision and remains under review by the commission during this period the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear and it is unclear how uk data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to long term and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated in the long term 

raw materials 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks however if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in the supply of products if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the us and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging particularly in light of the covid19 pandemic foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition it may limit our ability to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

ongoing uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners when our customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results our global business has been negatively affected by local economic conditions including inflation increasing labor costs recession and currency exchange rate fluctuations which has adversely affected our cost to manufacture and provide our products and services and revenues generated through sales of such products and services there is no guarantee that we will be able to fully absorb any such additional costs or revenue declines in the prices for our products and services 

coopervision and coopersurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains due to this trend global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

inflation could materially adversely affect our business and operations 

our operating results could be materially impacted by changes in the overall macroeconomic environment and other economic factors that impact our cost structure and revenue results changes in economic conditions supply chain constraints logistics challenges labor shortages the war in ukraine and steps taken by governments and central banks particularly in response to the covid19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs have led to higher inflation which is likely to lead to an increase in costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy including increased interest rates in a higher inflationary environment we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the us and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america and europe more than half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2022 and 2021 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including the following 

• difficulty managing a large organization spread throughout various countries 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates adversely affecting our results 

• difficulty managing the effects of the covid19 pandemic on our ability to operate internationally and for our employees to travel internationally 

• challenges associated with enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

• difficulty gaining market share in countries such as china because of regulatory restrictions and customer preferences 

• difficulty growing our sales in emerging markets such as china india russia brazil and other developing nations due to among other things customer acceptance undeveloped andor unfamiliar distribution channels regulatory restrictions and changes and business knowledge of these new markets 

• foreign earnings being subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions including the tariffs enacted by the chinese government on certain us goods the scope and duration of which remain uncertain 

• challenges in complying with a variety of international legal compliance and regulatory requirements such as the foreign corrupt practices act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the uk bribery act international data security and privacy laws eu mdr and eu ivdr 

• foreign customers creating longer payment cycles than customers in the us 

• failure to comply with us department of commerce and other nations importexport controls may result in fines andor penalties 

• general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate having an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or being unfavorable to our growth strategy 

• natural disasters pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts may cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability resulting in decreased demand for our products adversely affecting our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or causing interruptions in our supply chain 

• foreign governments adopting regulations including those similar to the eu mdr and eu ivdr or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities including but not limited to increased enforcement of potentially conflicting and ambiguous antibribery and privacy laws 

• challenges enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems and 

• unforeseen economic or political events in certain countries that may have an impact on our customers ability or preferences to buy our products 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

the war between russia and ukraine could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

on february 24 2022 russian military forces launched a military action in ukraine and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely the length impact and outcome of this ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable and could lead to significant market and other disruptions including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources instability in financial markets supply chain interruptions political and social instability trade disputes or trade barriers changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage 

the war has led to significant sanctions programs imposed by the us the european union the uk canada switzerland japan and other countries against russia belarus the crimea region of ukraine the socalled donetsk people’s republic and the socalled luhansk people’s republic including among others 

• blocking sanctions against some of the largest stateowned and private russian financial institutions and their subsequent removal from the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication payment system and certain russian businesses some of which have significant financial and trade ties to the european union 

• blocking sanctions against russian and belarusian individuals including the russian president other politicians and those with government connections or involved in russian military activities 

• blocking of russia’s foreign currency reserves as well as expansion of sectoral sanctions and export and trade restrictions limitations on investments and access to capital markets and bans on various russian imports and 

• enhanced export controls and trade sanctions targeting russia’s imports of technological goods as a whole including tighter controls on exports and reexports of dualuse items stricter licensing policy with respect to issuing export licenses andor increased use of “enduse” controls to block or impose licensing requirements on exports as well as higher import tariffs and a prohibition on exporting luxury goods to russia and belarus 

in retaliation against new international sanctions and as part of measures to stabilize and support the volatile russian financial and currency markets the russian authorities also imposed significant currency control measures aimed at restricting the outflow of foreign currency and capital from russia imposed various restrictions on transacting with nonrussian parties banned exports of various products and imposed other economic and financial restrictions the situation is rapidly evolving and additional sanctions by russia on the one hand and by the other countries on the other hand could adversely affect the global economy financial markets energy supply and prices certain critical materials and metals supply chains and global logistics and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

our business must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations including those administered and enforced by the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control the us department of state the us department of commerce the united nations security council and other relevant governmental authorities if we are found to be in violation of us sanctions or export control laws it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for individuals working for us we are actively monitoring the situation in ukraine and russia and assessing its impact on our business including our business partners employees and customers to date we have not experienced any material interruptions in our infrastructure supplies technology systems or networks needed to support our operations the conflict has caused us to modify our operations in russia and could lead to additional modifications in russia we cannot predict the progress or outcome of the war or its impacts in the territories where we operate the extent and duration of the military action sanctions other consequences such as russia imposing restrictions on transactions or banning the export of energy products including natural gas and the resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time any such disruption may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this section 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the future by the global covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally and has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption within the markets in which we operate the pandemic has adversely affected and is likely to further adversely affect nearly all aspects of our business and markets including our sales operations cash flow and workforce and the operations of our customers suppliers vendors and business partners among other things many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures in response to the pandemic and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits which has resulted in reduced demand for and sales of our products and services 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic persists with surges in infection and associated government responses our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in numerous ways including but not limited to decreased net sales from sales of our products and services due to customer facility closures restricted access and reduced patient visits exams and elective medical procedures disruption in the manufacture and distribution of our products including increased manufacturing and distribution costs reduced manufacturing capacity and inadequate inventory levels increased risk of inventory that may expire writeoffs or obsolescence of inventory equipment or other assets disruptions to or increased costs from our raw material and product suppliers and broader supply chain and distribution systems delays in our clinical trials which could negatively impact our new product pipeline milestones and regulatory clearances approvals or certifications extended delays in or defaults on payments of outstanding receivables insolvency of customers suppliers vendors and business partners an inability to access lending capital markets and other sources of liquidity when needed on reasonable terms or at all an inability to comply with financial covenants in our debt agreements and future restructuring impairment and other charges 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain difficult to predict and largely outside of our control including but not limited to the continued spread duration and severity of the pandemic outbreak the occurrence spread duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks including the emergence and spread of variants of the covid19 virus the impact on our customers and suppliers the actions taken by the us and foreign governments to contain the pandemic address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity the occurrence duration and severity of a global regional or national recession depression or other sustained adverse market event and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations in fiscal 2022 coopervision acquired a privatelyheld denmarkbased orthok contact lens distributor in fiscal 2021 coopervision acquired a privately held medical device company and a privatelyheld uk contact lenses manufacturer in fiscal 2022 coopersurgical acquired a private cryopreservation services company and generate life sciences generate a privatelyheld provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage cord blood  cord tissue in fiscal 2021 coopersurgical acquired three privatelyheld medical device companies 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and one privatelyheld ivf cryostorage software solutions company risks we could face with respect to these acquisitions include 

• failure to successfully obtain the anticipated revenues margins and earnings benefits 

• difficulties in and expenses related to the integration of the operations technologies products and personnel of the acquired company and establishment of appropriate accounting controls and reporting procedures and other regulatory compliance procedures including but not limited to thirdparty compliance and due diligence 

• increased leverage and the risk of lack of access to available financing including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt owed by us on a timely basis and on reasonable terms 

• risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 

• potential loss of employees 

• an inability to identify and consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 

• diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns 

• risks of the acquired company’s noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

• expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations of the acquired company 

• expenses including restructuring expenses to shutdown our own locations or terminate our employees 

• application of and compliance with new and unfamiliar regulatory frameworks such as regulation applicable to our newly acquired fertilityrelated businesses 

• failure to successfully obtain or maintain reimbursements under the thirdparty payor plans including but not limited to governmental programs due to complex reporting and payment obligations 

• a dilution of earnings per share and 

• risks inherent in accounting allocations and the risk that we are required to record significant adjustments to the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period 

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing distribution and storage operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or constrained idle or excess capacity which could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities or our fertility and stem cell storage facilities whether due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related work stoppages technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or similar foreign requirements or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely constrained excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions unexpected demand inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability capital investments customer service levels and nearterm financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in costa rica hungary puerto rico the uk and the us with other smaller facilities also existing in multiple locations around the world coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in costa rica the uk and the us with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world in november 2017 coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to obtain required regulatory approvals validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of belgium hungary the uk and the us and various smaller international distribution sites coopersurgical primarily distributes products out of its facilities in the us and the netherlands and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

operates fertility and stem cell storage facilities in the us canada and australia any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution or storage facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties challenges related to system implementation destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or those of our thirdparty service providers or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm 

security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers or partners the size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are increasing in their frequency levels of persistence levels of sophistication and intensity and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise especially given increased vulnerability of corporate information technology systems as distributed work environments have become prevalent including as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal data confidential information intellectual property or other sensitive information such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and ransomware and may use a variety of methods including denialofservice attacks social engineering and other means to attain such unauthorized access or acquisition or otherwise affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality integrity and availability of information like many other companies we experience attempted cybersecurity actions on a frequent basis and the frequency of such attempts could increase in the future while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches the techniques used by cybercriminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources including outside groups such as external service providers organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies we cannot assure that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns data leakages or breaches in our systems or those of our thirdparty services providers or partners any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing new enterprise resource planning erp systems at coopervision and coopersurgical implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

pricing pressure from our competitors customers and changes in thirdparty coverage and reimbursement may adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our operating results 

competition in our industry has increased as a result of new market entrants new technologies and as more established companies have intensified competitive pricing pressure as a result of these competitive forces we believe there will continue to be pricing pressure in the future because our coopersurgical products are generally purchased by hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics and billed to various thirdparty payors changes in the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

purchasing behavior of such customers or the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products including as a result of healthcare reform initiatives could create additional pricing pressure on us in addition to these competitive forces we continue to see pricing pressure as our customers introduce new pricing structures into their contracts and agreements including fixed price formulas capitated pricing and structured pricing intended to contain healthcare costs such trends may adversely affect demand for our products and may drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products both of which would negatively affect our operating results 

we rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials packaging materials and components mechanical equipment and some finished goods we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products we also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from oem suppliers supply of these goods items and materials is protected by contractual agreements availability of alternative suppliers andor safety stocks however if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods items or materials to us on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products for example among other situations some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by few or sole suppliers and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our supply chain and our cost of goods also may be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation including wage inflation or to supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

• be expensive and time consuming to prosecute or defend 

• result in a finding that we do not have certain intellectual property rights or that such rights lack sufficient scope or strength 

• divert managements attention and resources or 

• require us to license our intellectual property 

we have applied for patent protection in the us the uk and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the us the uk and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the us adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the us and foreign countries some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies as well as other third parties may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

• be expensive and time consuming to defend 

• cause us to cease making licensing or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 

• require us to redesign or reengineer our products if feasible 

• divert managements attention and resources or 

• require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product component or process 

we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including the accuracy and quality of our genetic testing fertility cryopreservation fertility donor gamete supply and stem cell storage services these risks may be heightened due to our directtoconsumer marketing efforts for some of our products and services eg stem cell storage and paragard iuds consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations these insurance policies may become more expensive or not be available for new risks we may assume when we acquire new businesses for example professional liability insurance for our genomics gamete and tissue storage businesses could add significant cost there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and some of our existing products are marketed and sold on the basis of potential future medical or therapeutic value assuming technology advances and we cannot be sure that any of them will achieve market acceptance or generate revenues or operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

• acceptance of our products by eye care and health care practitioners 

• the cost competitiveness of our products 

• consumer reluctance to try and use a new product 

• regulatory and legislative requirements 

• adequate coverage and reimbursement by thirdparty payors 

• lack of scientific advancements to validate the medical value of certain products such as stored cord blood or cord tissue or scientific advancements in other medical approaches that reduce or eliminate the value of such products and 

• the earlier release of competitive products such as new silicone hydrogel products or contraceptive technologies into the market by our competitors and the emergence of newer and more competitive products 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our largest competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon inc and bausch health companies inc may have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogelbased products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities and our ability to secure adequate supply of materials used in production at reasonable costs our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision’s strategy or interfere with its customers’ relationships and loyalty for example more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner coopervision’s failure to adapt 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

to the threats posed by these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the family and womens health care market with a diversified portfolio of products and services including medical devices in outpatient and operating room settings fertility contraception and healthcare technology services competitive factors in these segments in which coopersurgical competes include technological and scientific advances product quality and availability price customer service including response time and effective communication of product information to physicians consumers fertility clinics and hospitals competition in the medical device industry is dynamic and involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations 

coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers and service providers in its women’s family health care market areas some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products in addition some of coopersurgical’s markets such as genomics contraception and cord blood and cord tissue storage are characterized by rapid technological advancement we face the risk that demand for our products will not grow or will decline if our competitors are more successful than us at innovating in these and other areas there is also risk that emerging technologies or technology advancements could reduce the medical value of certain of our products and services such as cord blood and cord tissue storage which could adversely affect our business in recent years coopersurgical has also expanded directtoconsumer products and services which requires implementing new competitive strategies and increases the importance of customer service and consumer reputation as competitive factors 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care and diagnostics testing industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services for example corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or certifications or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopervision both internally and externally with third parties invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses while much of coopervision’s research and development activities are performed internally it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties coopersurgical has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical also has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organic growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects greater dependence on and reduced control over thirdparty deliverables the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval or certification and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals certifications or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval or certification in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies with respect to our coopervision products these developments could include contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses that incorporate electronics which could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia with respect to coopersurgical products and services novel contraceptive devices or methods genetic testing methods and disease treatments could reduce or eliminate demand for certain of our products and services failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted these regulations include for example regulations enacted in the european union such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products our coopersurgical division manufactures these and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in japan china and various states of the us may require us to redesign certain products to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 

environmental social and corporate governance esg issues including those related to climate change and sustainability may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

there is an increasing focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning esg matters additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ esg practices continue to grow if our esg practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor customer consumer employee or other stakeholders evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship support for local communities board of director and employee diversity human capital management employee health and safety practices product quality supply chain management corporate governance and transparency our reputation brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us 

customers consumers investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change energy and water use plastic waste and other sustainability concerns concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials in particular may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment changing customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse and nonrecyclable plastic products and packaging other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing operating or product development costs 

if we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fail to meet evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and concerns regarding esg issues investors may reconsider their capital investment in our company and customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business or financial condition 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing manufacturing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel we are experiencing increasing challenges in building and retaining our workforce in certain markets where pressure from inflation and competition have exacerbated turnover and retention trends continuing from the covid19 pandemic labor shortages and competition for qualified personnel could cause disruptions in our business operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have antitakeover effects 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal state and foreign laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information including health related information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

numerous laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use privacy confidentiality security availability and integrity of individually identifiable information including protected health information phi we collect and process individually identifiable information in multiple ways in our various business lines and are subject to risk associated with compliance with many of these laws and regulations some of our businesses expose us to increasingly stringent regulations for handling personal information where for example we collect or process personal data deemed to be sensitive by regulatory authorities such as phi 

under us law hipaa establishes national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services including another one of our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed and to adopt administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect phi when we are acting as a business associate our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us  known as business associate agreements  that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates 

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations however our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins viruses hackers and other potential sources of security breaches in addition we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors despite the safeguards any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws andor under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business 

even when hipaa does not apply according to the ftc violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section 5a of the federal trade commission act the ftc expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities 

further california enacted the ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents certain rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation although there are limited exemptions for healthrelated information including phi and clinical trial data the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability further the cpra which will go into effect on january 1 2023 significantly amends the ccpa and will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses including additional consumer rights processes limitations on data uses new audit requirements for higher risk processing and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data it will also create a new california data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement similar laws have been proposed or enacted in other states and at the federal level and when passed such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than us covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu and eea member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations for example the gdpr went into effect on may 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

25 2018 and imposes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data in the context of an establishment in the eea or the processing of personal data of individuals within the eea including for example expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized eg keycoded data mandatory data breach notification requirements handling data subject access requests and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities in addition countries of the eea may impose further obligations relating to the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information some of the personal data we process in respect of clinical trial participants is special category or sensitive personal data under the gdpr and subject to additional compliance obligations and to local law derogations we may be subject to diverging requirements under eu member state laws and uk law such as whether consent can be used as the legal basis for processing in clinical trials and the roles responsibilities and liabilities as between contract research organizations and sponsors as these laws develop we may need to make operational changes to adapt to these diverging rules which could increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

in addition the gdpr increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from the eea including from clinical trial sites located in the eea to the us and other jurisdictions that the european commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union issued its judgment in the schrems ii case and limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the eea to the us by invalidating the euus privacy shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the eea indeed while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place subsequent european court and regulator decisions have taken a restrictive approach to international data transfers on june 4 2021 the european commission adopted the new standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries new sccs the new sccs combine general clauses applicable in all cases with four modules that are adapted to different transfer scenarios while the new sccs better address the schrems ii requirements and the modern digital economy with its diverse processing realities and often complex processing chains with multiple parties and sometimes changing roles they are generally more complicated to prepare and adopt on june 18 2021 the european data protection board issued recommendations 012020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the eu level of protection of personal data 

the european commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the uk enabling data transfers from eu member states to the uk without additional safeguards however the uk adequacy decision will automatically expire in june 2025 unless the european commission reassesses and renewsextends that decision and remains under review by the commission during this period the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear and it is unclear how uk data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated in the long term which exposes us to further compliance risk 

compliance with us and foreign privacy and security laws rules and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts require us to engage in costly compliance exercises restrict our ability to collect use and disclose data or in some cases impact our or our partners’ or suppliers’ ability to operate in certain jurisdictions each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection supervisory authorities fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business for example companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant undertaking whichever is greater additionally following the uk’s withdrawal from the eea and the eu and the expiry of the transition period companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the uk national law the uk gdpr the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of annual global turnover in addition to fines a breach of the gdpr andor uk gdpr may result in regulatory investigations reputational damage orders to cease or change our data processing activities enforcement notices assessment notices for a compulsory audit andor civil claims including class actions such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

when we acquire companies or business that engage personal data processing we may become subject to additional regulation or scrutiny particularly if such activity is different in nature from what we have done in the past for example 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

with the recent addition of cord blood and cord tissue storage and other cryostorage businesses we interact directly with our customers and collect and maintain personal information regarding our customers and donors acquisitions like this could subject us to additional regulatory and consumer liability risk and the cost of analyzing and integrating new privacy compliance programs 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the us among the provisions of the aca of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following 

• establishment of the patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research 

• payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals physicians and other providers to improve the coordination quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models 

• establishment of a center for medicare  medicaid innovation at cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending and 

• an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program to 231 and 13 of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs respectively 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility office and surgical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers in addition the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the us since the aca was enacted for example on march 11 2021 president biden signed the american rescue plan act of 2021 into law which eliminates the statutory medicaid drug rebate cap currently set at 100 of a drug’s average manufacturer price amp beginning january 1 2024 most recently on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022 or ira was signed into law among other things the ira requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with medicare beginning in 2026 with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap imposes rebates under medicare part b and medicare part d to penalize price increases that outpace inflation first due in 2023 and replaces the part d coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program beginning in 2025 the ira permits the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs to implement many of these provisions through guidance as opposed to regulation for the initial years for that and other reasons it is currently unclear how the ira will be effectuated and the impact of the ira on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined 

in foreign countries where we market our products recent healthcare reform has taken place as well for instance in december 2021 the eu regulation no 20212282 on health technology assessment hta amending directive 201124eu was adopted this regulation which became effective in january 2022 intends to boost cooperation among eu member states in assessing health technologies including some medical devices and providing the basis for cooperation at the eu level for joint clinical assessments in these areas the regulation foresees a threeyear transitional period and will permit eu member states to use common hta tools methodologies and procedures across the eu working together in four main areas including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from hta authorities identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas individual eu member states will continue to be responsible for assessing nonclinical eg economic social ethical aspects of health technologies and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement 

we expect that additional state federal and foreign health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal state and foreign governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the us or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer 

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback physician selfreferral false claims and physician payment transparency laws and regulations these laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations including our commercial laboratory operations and how we research market sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval such laws include 

• the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing any remuneration including any kickback bribe or certain rebates directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind in return for either the referral of an individual or the purchase lease or order or arranging for or recommending the purchase lease or order of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal antikickback statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the federal physician selfreferral prohibitions commonly known as the stark law which generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the medicare or medicaid programs for certain designated health services including clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service or any member of such physician’s immediate family has a financial interest such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition these prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral 

• the federal false claims laws including the civil false claims act and civil monetary penalties laws which prohibit among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to the federal government claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government in addition the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute or stark law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act 

• the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

• the federal physician payments sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program with certain exceptions to report annually to the cms information related to payments and other “transfers of value” made to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by such healthcare professionals and their immediate family members beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives and 

• analogous state and foreign laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental thirdparty payors including private insurers and selfpay patients some state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug and device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures some state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products and some state and local laws that require the registration of sales representatives 

in addition federal government price reporting laws among other things require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement andor discounts on our marketed drugs participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts 

violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legislative or regulatory reforms in the united states or europe may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances approvals or certifications for our products or to manufacture market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained 

from time to time legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis for example over the last several years the fda has proposed reforms to its 510k clearance process and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510k clearance process for their products 

in addition fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the fda in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products any new statutes regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for manufacture market or distribute our products we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations statutes legal interpretation or policies when and if promulgated enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future such changes could among other things require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval changes to manufacturing methods recall replacement or discontinuance of our products or additional record keeping 

in addition to traditional regulatory controls on medical devices our business could be affected by emerging laws or regulations limiting our ability offer certain of our products and services for example in the us the reversal by the us supreme court of roe v wade has raised concerns in the fertility industry that more restrictive laws could limit access to various reproductive services new and emerging laws may be interpreted to limit access to contraceptive technologies or cryostorage services which could adversely affect certain aspects of coopersurgical’s business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition the eu landscape concerning medical devices including ivds has recently evolved a new set of two eu regulations have been adopted on april 5 2017 on may 26 2021 the eu mdr became applicable and replaced previous directives as to the eu ivdr it became applicable on may 26 2022 however on october 14 2021 the european commission proposed a “progressive” rollout of the eu ivdr to prevent disruption in the supply of ivds the european parliament and council adopted the proposed regulation on december 15 2021 the eu ivdr fully applies since may 26 2022 but there will be a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices depending on their risk classification before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation both regulations have been adopted to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eu for medical devices including ivds and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

these modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the eu and eea for example as a result of the transition towards the new regimes notified body review times have lengthened and product introductions could be delayed or canceled additionally only a few notified bodies have been designated for eu ivdr certification which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 

following the end of the “brexit” transitional period from january 1 2021 the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra became the uk’s independent regulatory agency for medical devices postbrexit amendments have been made to the existing uk medical devices legislation which require medical devices to be registered with the mhra before being placed on the great britain market manufacturers based outside of the uk need to appoint a uk responsible person to register devices with the mhra following a government consultation on changes to the uk’s medical device regulations the response to which was published on june 26 2022 it is anticipated that amendments to the legislation will soon be published by the government and should become applicable by july 1 2023 so that medical devices placed on the market in great britain england scotland and wales will require a uk conformity assessment ukca mark however within the government’s consultation response it has proposed that transition periods will be included in the revised legislation so that products with existing and valid conformity assessments ce mark or ukca mark could continue to be placed on the great britain market for a maximum of 35 years after july 1 2023 depending on which legislation the medical device has been certified under ivds with valid certification can continue to be placed on the market until the earlier of certificate expiry or for a period of five years following publication of the new regulations however ukca marking alone will not be recognized in the eu the rules for placing medical devices on the northern ireland market will differ from those in great britain these modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to conduct our business in these countries 

our medical device products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance approval or certification which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies as well as audits by notified bodies in other countries 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable domestic or international regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance approval or certification for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the us the fda regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the us and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products increase the cost of compliance impose additional regulatory requirements on us or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

modifications and enhancements to medical devices also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

our efforts to promote some of our products and services via directtoconsumer marketing initiatives may subject us to additional scrutiny by the fda ftc or other agencies for example we promote paragard and cord blood and cord tissue storage directly to end consumers regulatory agencies may scrutinize our practices with respect to effective communication of risk information benefits or claims with respect to such products 

any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products and product candidates if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the fda’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the us or abroad 

subject to transitional provisions and in order to sell our products in the eu our products must respectively comply with general safety and performance requirements of the eu mdr and the eu ivdr compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the european conformity ce mark to our products without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the eu all medical devices placed on the market in the eu must meet the general safety and performance 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

requirements laid down in the annexes to the eu mdr and eu ivdr including that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that during normal conditions of use it is suitable for its intended purpose medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and where applicable other persons provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art to demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i or general ivds class a where the manufacturer can selfassess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements except for any parts which relate to sterility metrology or reuse aspects of a medical device a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body notified bodies are independent organizations designated by eu member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market a notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards—iso 134852016 for quality management systems—conform to these requirements if satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the general safety and performance requirements the notified body issues a certificate of conformity which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity the manufacturer may then apply the ce mark to the device which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the eu if we fail to remain in compliance with applicable eu laws directives or regulations we would be unable to continue to affix the ce mark to our products which would prevent us from selling them within the eu and eea 

the eu regulatory landscape concerning medical devices including ivds has recently evolved and the new requirements may have a significant effect on the way we conduct our business in the eu and the eea following brexit the uk regulatory landscape concerning medical devices including ivds is evolving and may have a significant effect on the way we conduct our business in the uk see risk factors – “legislative or regulatory reforms in the united states or europe may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances approvals or certifications for our products or to manufacture market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained” 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications or certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french antigift legislation duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals or certifications and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

we offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the us and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the us and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldts we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however if there are changes in the fda’s policy or if the fda disagrees that our marketed tests are ldts or that we are marketing our tests outside the scope of the fda’s current policy of enforcement discretion we may become subject to extensive regulatory requirements and may be required to stop selling our existing tests or launching any other tests we may develop and to conduct additional clinical trials or take other actions prior to continuing to market our tests this could significantly increase the costs and expenses of conducting or otherwise harm our business 

legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldt have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

with respect to certain ldt is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldt our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldt it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldt or new legislation regulations such as the eu ivdr regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our genetic products and to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

in addition changes in the way the eu regulates ldts could result in additional expenses for offering our current and any future tests or possibly delay or suspend development or commercialization of such tests in the eu the regulatory landscape has recently evolved and the general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i are also applicable to devices manufactured and used only within health institutions the exemptions provided under the eu ivdr for ldts remain to be further interpreted and clarified if our tests do not qualify for an exemption we may be subject to the full application of the eu ivdr with respect to some or all of our existing as well as future tests and we would be required to expend additional time and resources to complying with the requirements of the eu ivdr 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our genetic tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia uk human fertilization  embryology association hfea regulating ivf a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratories must be certified under clia and iso 15189 in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the us by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in japan the uk and us and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction 

any sanction imposed under clia its implementing regulations or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure or our failure to renew a clia certificate a state license or accreditation could have a material and adverse effect on our diagnostic testing business operating results and financial condition the cms also has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions including revocation of the clia certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of a cliacertified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory if we were to lose our clia certification or required state licensure we would not be able to operate our clinical laboratory and conduct our tests in full or in particular states which would adversely impact our diagnostic testing business operating results and financial condition 

our hctp products are subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with these requirements could cause our business to suffer 

in the us we provide donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments in addition to fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage cord blood and cord tissue donated reproductive tissues including eggs and sperm as well as cord blood and cord tissue are regulated to by the fda as human cells tissues and cellular or tissuebased products hctps in the us we are marketing these hctps pursuant to section 361 of the public health service act phsa and 21 cfr part 1271 of fda’s regulations the socalled “361 hctps” are not currently subject to the fda requirements to obtain marketing authorizations so long as they meet certain criteria set forth in fda regulations however hctps regulated as 361 hctps are currently subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the fda as well as stringent requirements relating to processing storing labeling and distributing hctps including screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility providing required labeling information record keeping and adverse event reporting if we fail to comply with these requirements we could be subject to fda allegations of noncompliance or enforcement action including for example warning letters fines injunctions product recalls or seizures and in the most serious cases criminal penalties to be regulated as 361 hctps these products must meet the fda’s criteria to be considered “minimally manipulated” and intended for “homologous use” among other requirements hctps that do not meet the criteria to be considered 361 hctps are subject to the fda’s regulatory requirements applicable to medical devices biologics or drugs including importantly the requirement for premarket review and approval or clearance prior to marketing 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we believe our hctps are regulated solely under section 361 of the phsa and therefore we have not sought or obtained 510k clearance pma approval or licensure through a biologics license application bla for such hctps however the fda could disagree with our determination that these human tissue products are 361 hctps and could determine that these products are biologics requiring a bla or medical devices requiring 510k clearance or pma approval and could require that we cease marketing such products andor recall them pending appropriate clearance approval or licensure from the fda which would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the fda may in the future modify the scope of its enforcement discretion with respect to 361 hctps or change its position on which current or future products qualify as 361 hctps or determine that some or all of our hctp products may not be lawfully marketed without a marketing authorization any regulatory changes could have adverse consequences for us and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business by requiring premarket clearance or approval and compliance with additional postmarket regulatory requirements with respect to those products 

disruptions at the fda and other government agencies or notified bodies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all which could negatively impact our business 

the ability of the fda foreign agencies and notified bodies to review and clear approve or certify new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels statutory regulatory and policy changes the fda’s foreign agencies’ and notified bodies’ ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and other events that may otherwise affect the fda’s foreign agencies’ and notified bodies’ ability to perform routine functions average review times at the fda foreign agencies and notified bodies have fluctuated in recent years as a result in addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable disruptions at the fda foreign agencies and notified bodies and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved drugs and medical devices to be reviewed approved andor certified by necessary government agencies or notified bodies which would adversely affect our business for example over the last several years the us government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the fda have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities 

separately in response to the covid19 pandemic starting in march 2020 the fda postponed most inspections of foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities subsequently in july 2020 the fda resumed certain onsite inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a riskbased prioritization system the fda utilized this riskbased system to assist in determining when and where it was safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections in may 2021 the fda outlined a detailed plan to move toward a more consistent state of inspectional operations and in july 2021 the fda resumed standard inspectional operations of domestic facilities since that time the fda has continued to monitor and implement changes to its inspectional activities to ensure the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates as it adapts to the evolving covid19 pandemic regulatory authorities outside the us have adopted similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the covid19 pandemic if a prolonged government shutdown occurs or if global health concerns continue to prevent the fda other regulatory authorities or notified bodies from conducting their regular inspections reviews or other regulatory activities it could significantly impact the ability of the fda other regulatory authorities or notified bodies to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in the eu notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the eu mdr and eu ivdr several notified bodies have been designated under the eu mdr but only a few notified bodies have been designated under the eu ivdr so far the covid19 pandemic has significantly slowed down their designation process and the current designated notified bodies are facing a large amount of requests with the new regulations as a consequence of which review times may have lengthened this situation may impact the ability of our notified body to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and perform its audits 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information sperm and egg selection services and stem cells could reduce demand for our service offerings 

genetic testing sperm and egg selection services and the use of stem cells have raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of information related to these services government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure they also could limit regulate or prohibit 1 sperm and egg selection services or 2 the use of stem cells ethical legal or social concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order or recommend genetic tests sperm and egg selection services and stem cell storage services even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns may limit market 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acceptance and adoption of our service offerings or reduce the potential markets for our service offerings either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to interest and foreign exchange rates debt and equity 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances they would not eliminate that risk entirely 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt from time to time we may use interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our variablerate debt as further described in note 13 financial derivatives and hedging of the consolidated financial statements we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

the uk’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 in march 2021 the fca confirmed its intention to stop requiring banks to submit rates required to calculate libor after 2021 however for us dollardenominated usd libor only oneweek and twomonth usd libor will cease to be published after 2021 and all remaining usd libor tenors will continue being published until june 2023 we have multiple debt facilities which bear interest at a variable rate based on the eurodollar libor rate in effect from time to time a change or transition away from libor as a common reference rate in the global financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business our management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding libor we do not expect a material impact on our financial statements related to this transition 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

• result in greater interest rate risk and volatility 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds and 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt including our obligation to repay our credit facilities under certain circumstances or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit plan costs 

we sponsor a defined benefit plan for certain employees in the us this defined benefit plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

risks relating to taxes 

changes in tax laws examinations by tax authorities and changes in our geographic composition of income could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition 

income taxes and other taxes are based on enacted tax laws and the results of operations in each jurisdiction taxes could significantly increase due to changes in tax laws or changes in our interpretation of those laws changes in tax laws could result from a framework being developed by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd a global policy forum that if implemented includes a global minimum tax rate of 15 taxes could also significantly increase due to changes in accounting guidance 

income taxes and other taxes could significantly increase based on the resolution of tax authority examinations tax authorities could challenge our interpretations of tax laws and estimates we use to calculate taxes tax authorities could also challenge our positions related to transfer pricing and intercompany transactions including the valuation of intangible assets tax examinations can result in costly litigation with significant interest and penalties and ultimate settlement can take several years for example we have engaged and expect to continue to engage with tax authorities over tax positions we have taken in connection with acquisitions and such examinations could cause us to incur significant expense and adverse determinations by the tax authority could result in penalties 

our effective tax rate could fluctuate based on the geographic composition of income which could significantly change based on our business results and acquisitions our effective tax rate could also fluctuate based on changes in estimates changes in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation changes in nondeductible expenses and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

outlook 

we are optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets and the resilience of and growth prospects for our businesses and products however we face significant risks and uncertainties in our global operating environment as further described in the “risk factors” section in part i item 1a of this filing these risks include uncertain global and regional business political and economic conditions including but not limited to those associated with the covid19 pandemic russia’s invasion of ukraine inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations regulatory developments supply chain disruptions and escalating global trade barriers these risks and uncertainties have adversely affected our sales cash flow and current performance in the past and are likely to further adversely affect our future sales cash flow and performance 

global market and economic conditions  over the last few years in the us and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging particularly in light of the covid19 pandemic foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues in addition changes in economic conditions supply chain constraints logistics challenges labor shortages the war in ukraine and steps taken by governments and central banks particularly in response to the covid19 pandemic as well as other stimulus and spending programs have led to higher inflation which is likely to lead to an increase in costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy including increased interest rates in a higher inflationary environment we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation these economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

covid19 considerations  the covid19 pandemic and health crisis led to ongoing economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties that have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid19 virus and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid19 virus many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits these factors have had and in the future may continue to have an adverse effect on our sales operating results and cash flows 

we have taken an active role in addressing the pandemic’s impact on our employees suppliers distribution channels operations and customers including taking precautionary measures and developing contingency plans with respect to our operations and to help ensure the safety of our personnel in all our facilities and we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide as of the date of this filing we have not experienced any significant disruption at our manufacturing facilities or in our access to necessary raw materials and other supplies or with our distribution network however we have experienced higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs labor inefficiencies delays in receiving certain raw materials higher cost of production and higher freight charges as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

at this time future developments with respect to the covid19 pandemic remain highly uncertain and largely outside of our control we cannot predict the spread duration and severity of the pandemic or any subsequent outbreaks potential actions taken by governments to respond to the pandemic or potential impacts on global and local economic activity we

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 



in the fiscal year ended october 31 2022 the growth experienced across all categories except for other as mentioned below was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations which approximated 1495 million sales growth was primarily driven by an increase in the volume of lenses sold across our core portfolio due to a recovery in demand from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• toric and multifocal lenses grew primarily through the success of myday and biofinity 

• singleuse sphere lenses grew primarily through myday clariti and misight lenses 

• non singleuse sphere lenses grew primarily through biofinity and orthok 

• other products decreased primarily due to exit of the contact lens care business contact lens care represented approximately 1 and 2 of net sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021

foreign exchange loss is primarily associated with the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies and the effect on intercompany receivables 

other expense income net increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to a loss on minority investments partially offset by defined benefit plan related income 

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 188 and 4991 respectively the increase was primarily due to an intragroup transfer of intellectual property in fiscal 2021 and uk tax rate change in fiscal 2021 as discussed below the increase was also due to changes in the geographic composition of pretax earnings and changes in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and changes in unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the intragroup transfer uk tax rate change and earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax 

in november 2020 the company completed an intragroup transfer of certain intellectual property and related assets of coopervision to a uk subsidiary as part of a group restructuring to establish headquarters operations in the uk determining fair value involved significant judgment related to future revenue growth operating margins and discount rates the transfer resulted in a stepup of the uk taxdeductible basis in the intellectual property and goodwill creating a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of these assets as a result the company recognized a deferred tax asset of 19879 million with a corresponding income tax benefit during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 the company recognized a 5367 million tax benefit related primarily to the remeasurement of this deferred tax asset caused by the uk enactment of a 25 corporate tax rate

capital resources and liquidity 

working capital at october 31 2022 and october 31 2021 was 2534 million and 7332 million respectively the decrease in working capital is primarily due to an increase in accounts payable as a result of timing of payment to vendors and an increase in shortterm debt due to the 364day term loan agreement entered into during fiscal 2022 see note 5 financing arrangements for further information 

the 431 million increase in inventories was primarily due to higher sales and the buildup of inventory for future product launches

critical accounting estimates 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

we believe the followings represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• revenue recognition  we recognize revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers andor when services are rendered our payment terms are typically between 30 to 120 days provisions for certain rebates sales incentives volume discounts contractual pricing allowances and product returns are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales 

product discounts including certain rebates sales incentives and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer we evaluate contractual terms historical experience and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized coopersurgical rebates are predominately related to the medicaid rebate provision that is estimated based upon contractual terms historical experience and trend analysis 

sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data promotional programs such as cooperative advertising arrangements are recorded in the same period as related sales reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates sales incentives volume discounts contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements we currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact 

• business combinations  we routinely consummate business combinations results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired including acquired inprocess research and development the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements key assumptions routinely utilized the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets include discount rates and projected financial information such as revenue projections for companies acquired as of the acquisition date goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 

• income taxes  income taxes are estimated based on enacted income tax laws and the results of operations in each jurisdiction deferred tax assets and liabilities are estimated based on temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not they are not expected to be realized longterm tax payable is estimated income tax to be paid for unrecognized tax benefits a tax benefit is recognized if it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax authority examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

• spherical lenses including lenses that correct near and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects 

• toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that in addition to correcting near and farsightedness address more complex visual defects such as astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse lenses and frequently replaced lenses which are designed for twoweek and monthly replacement 

coopervision offers spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision uses different manufacturing processes primarily cast molding to produce its lenses we believe this allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

• producing high medium and low volumes of lenses made with a variety of materials for a broader range of market niches singleuse twoweek monthly and quarterly disposable sphere toric and multifocal lenses custom toric lenses for patients with a high degree of astigmatism and myopia management contact lenses 

• offering a wide range of lens parameters leading to a higher rate of successful fitting for practitioners and better visual acuity for patients 

the market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new valueadded products such as spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices and add aspherical optical properties andor higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels and myopia management contact lenses 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business silicone hydrogel lenses represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity ® brand is coopervisions leading product line in terms of sales under the biofinity brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical including biofinity energys ®  toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products 

coopervision markets singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses with a complete line of spherical toric extended toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti ® 1 day brand and singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lenses under our myday ® brand we also compete in the traditional hydrogel singleuse product segment with several lenses including our proclear ® 1 day lenses we believe the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that our competitive silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel product offerings represent an opportunity for our business 

in addition to its silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with other traditional hydrogel products 

coopervision believes that our key accounts which include optical chains global retailers certain buying groups and mass merchandisers are growing faster than the overall market we are focused on supporting the growth of all our customers by investing in selling promotional and advertising activities further we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue providing quality service with our industry leading sku range and customized offerings 

coopervision believes that myopia management opens up an attractive new market for contact lenses with misight coopervision offers the only fda approved and first chinese nmpa approved product to control the progression of myopia in children coopervision is investing to create this new market by educating eye care practitioners patients and their families which increases awareness 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions in fiscal 2021 coopervision acquired a privately held medical device company and a privatelyheld uk contact lenses manufacturer in fiscal 2020 coopervision acquired a privatelyheld us contact lens manufacturer focusing on orthok lenses these acquisitions expanded coopervision’s specialty eye care portfolio and its leadership in addressing the increasing severity and prevalence of myopia

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon inc and bausch health companies inc 

coopervisions competitors may have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects including laser vision correction coopervision believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products clariti 1 day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses myday ® singleuse spherical toric and multifocal lenses biofinity monthly spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lenses and avaira vitality ® twoweek spherical and toric lenses coopervision believes the clariti 1 day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market coopervision offers both branded and private label options in contact lenses its private label option is frequently offered as part of a larger customized solution for its customers it also competes in the specialty contact lens space with its fda approved misight 1 day contact lens for myopia management as well as orthok and scleral lenses 

in addition to a broad offering of silicone hydrogel and specialty contact lenses coopervision competes with different manufacturing processes which allow it to produce a broad range of spheres toric and multifocal lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low 

coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products and services focused on advancing the health of women babies and families through a diversified portfolio of products and services including medical devices fertility genomics diagnostics and contraception we offer quality products innovative technologies and superior services to health care professionals and patients worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with health care professionals to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to diagnostic tests to sophisticated instruments and equipment to bring new products to market the result is a broad portfolio of products and services that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that health care professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of womens health and reproductive issues 

one of coopersurgical’s focus areas is key accounts which include large group practices integrated delivery networks and certain buying groups within the officesurgical business and fertility clinic networks within the fertility business we believe our portfolio of offerings and focus on service quality and clinical education will support the accelerated growth of our business in the key account groups 

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

in fiscal 2021 coopersurgical acquired three privatelyheld medical device companies and one privatelyheld in vitro fertilization ivf cryostorage software solutions company in fiscal 2020 coopersurgical acquired a privatelyheld distributor of ivf medical devices and systems we intend to continue investing in coopersurgicals business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of family health fertility and diagnostics

market for womens and family reproductive health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for family health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to women’s health provider offices in the united states to increase over the next decade from adolescent care to geriatrics there is increased awareness of women’s health issues during the reproductive years fertility awareness and family planning are key areas of focus the attention in maternity care to improving access to safe effective and equitable obstetrical care continues as we expect an increase in the population of women over the age of 65 office visits focused around abnormal bleeding incontinence and menopause will likely increase 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the continued migration of obgyn health care professionals away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this overall trend of consolidation of healthcare systems includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement across these caredelivery systems coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

recent trends of patientcentered valuebased care in the united states market include the development of more costeffective health care delivery models including moving treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect to see continued changes in reimbursement and clinical best practices as payment models and policies continue to evolve 

some significant features of the obgyn market are 

• routine office visits annual wellwomen checkups preventative cancer screening and contraception 

• evaluation and management em office visits assessment of menstrual disorders pelvic infections urinary incontinence abnormal pap smears fertility concerns pregnancy and menopause approximately a third of gynecology office visits are related to abnormal uterine bleeding 

• officebased procedures are increasing given high patient satisfaction reduction of health system cost and comparative clinical outcomes 

• hysterectomy and cesarean section remain common hospital surgical interventions in women worldwide 

• initial evaluation and treatments for infertility such as uterine assessment ovulatory medications and intrauterine insemination iui begin with the obgyn then transition to fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as 

• infertility rates are increasing globally and there is a significant unmet need for fertility services 

• patient awareness of and access to services are increasing at a rapid pace 

• the number of fertility clinics is rising worldwide 

• the fertility market is fueled by dynamics such as increasing maternal age single parents by choice and lgbtq identifying individuals starting families

government regulation 

medical device regulation in the united states 

most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage record keeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either premarket notification to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes—class i ii or iii—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices subject to different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are devices with the lowest risk and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation qsr facility 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are moderate risk devices which are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and amendments to the fda reauthorization act mdufa iv unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions require payment of user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to substantially higher user fees under mdufa iv than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a class i or class ii device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device a predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a pma a device that was legally marketed in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 a preamendments device and for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of a pma a device that has been reclassified from class iii to class ii or i or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510k premarket notification process the fda aims to make substantial equivalence determinations following receipt of a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires additional information to support substantial equivalence if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate the device is automatically designated as a class iii device the device sponsor must fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or depending on the modification pma approval or de novo classification the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda may require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or until premarket approval is obtained or a de novo classification request is granted in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

over the last several years the fda has proposed reforms to its 510k clearance process and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510k clearance process for their products for example in november 2018 fda officials announced forthcoming steps that the fda intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under section 510k of the fdca among other things the fda announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510k pathway toward the use of newer predicates these proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510k clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted and the fda may work with congress to implement such proposals through legislation 

in september 2019 the fda published updated guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain wellunderstood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510k clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the fda thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process the fda intends to develop and maintain a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop productspecific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents where feasible 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures or if the device has been previously classified as class iii unless otherwise 510k exempt the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical nonclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

following receipt of a pma application the fda conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review if it is not the agency will refuse to file the pma if it is the fda will accept the application for filing and begin the review the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data nonclinical data or clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicants response to deficiencies communicated by the fda the fda considers a pma or pma supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an fda request for information eg major deficiency letter within 180 days after the fda issues such request also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr which among other things requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses the fda may approve a pma application with post 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval the fda may also condition approval of a pma application on some form of postmarket surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use in such cases the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the fda on the clinical status of those patients failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the pma process pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a pma application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials for medical devices 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required to obtain clearance of a 510k premarket notification these trials may require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda depending on the device if the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health then the device sponsor is not required to submit an ide application to the fda before initiating human clinical trials but must still comply with abbreviated ide requirements when conducting such trials a significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted used in supporting or sustaining human life substantially important in diagnosing curing mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject if the device presents a “significant risk” to human health the sponsor must submit an ide application to the fda and obtain ide approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials the ide application which includes a clinical study protocol must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks to human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless the fda notifies the company that the investigation may not begin if the fda determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an ide for which it requires modification the fda may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device clinical studies must be approved by and conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board irb for each clinical site the irb is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the study and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation of medical devices 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations which require changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections for cause by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements which are subject to new legislation and change can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

we provide certain genetic testing laboratory services in the united states under the fdca and the fda’s regulatory framework in vitro diagnostic devices ivds are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases such as cancer or other conditions the fda considers laboratory developed tests ldts to be a subset of ivds which are intended for clinical use and are designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced certain applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldts 

even under its current enforcement discretion policy the fda has issued warning letters to ivd manufacturers for commercializing laboratory tests that were purported to be ldts but that the fda alleged failed to meet the definition of an ldt or otherwise were not subject to the fda’s policy on enforcement discretion because they presented a potential safety risk additionally the fda could change its policy of enforcement discretion for ldts even without legislation for example in recent years the fda has stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to ldts specifically on july 31 2014 the fda notified congress of its intent to modify in a riskbased manner its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts on october 3 2014 the fda issued two draft guidance documents entitled “framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests ldts” or the framework guidance and “fda notification and medical device reporting for ldts” or the reporting guidance the framework guidance stated that fda intended to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts in a riskbased manner consistent with the classification of medical devices generally in classes i through iii the reporting guidance would have further enabled the fda to collect information regarding the ldts currently being offered for clinical use through a notification process as well as to enforce its regulations for reporting safety issues and collecting information on any known or suspected adverse events related to the use of an ldt the fda halted finalization of this guidance in november 2016 to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach for ldts and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution in january 2017 the fda issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to ldt regulation 

legislative and administrative proposals proposing to amend the fda’s oversight of ldts have been introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will continue to be introduced from time to time for example key congressional committees with jurisdiction over fda matters have indicated an interest in continuing negotiations on potential legislation regarding 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

ldts in march 2020 the valid act was introduced in the house and an identical version of the bill was introduced in the us senate if passed in its current form the valid act would create a new category of medical products separate from medical devices called “in vitro clinical tests” or ivcts as proposed the bill would establish a riskbased approach to imposing requirements related to premarket review quality systems and labeling requirements on all ivcts including ldts but would create exemptions for certain ldts marketed before the effective date of the bill though other regulatory requirements may apply such as registration and adverse event reporting in june 2021 a revised version of the valid act was reintroduced in both the house and the senate it is unclear whether the valid act or any other legislative proposals including any proposals to reduce fda oversight of ldts would be passed by congress or signed into law by the president depending on the approach adopted under any potential legislation certain ldts could become subject to some form of premarket review potentially with a transition period for compliance and a grandfathering provision moreover in august 2020 the us department of health and human services issued a rescission order stating that the fda will not require premarket review of ldts absent changes in policy implemented through formal noticeandcomment rulemaking procedures the degree to which this rescission order will affect fda’s enforcement discretion policy or its oversight over ldts remains unclear 

if congress does not take action in connection with the valid act or other ldt legislation it is possible that the fda could change its regulatory policy governing ldts in a way that could require that our currently marketed genetic tests and any future products that we anticipate marketing as ldts comply with certain additional fda requirements 

as we operate a genetic testing laboratory we are required to hold certain federal state and local licenses certifications and permits to conduct our business under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or clia we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations including test processes personnel facilities administration equipment maintenance recordkeeping quality systems and proficiency testing we have current certification under clia to perform testing at our new jersey facility to renew our clia certificate we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards the regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time and any such changes could have a material effect on our business penalties for noncompliance with clia requirements include suspension limitation or revocation of the laboratory’s clia certificate as well as a directed plan of correction state onsite monitoring civil money penalties civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties 

in addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under clia licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under state law such laws establish standards for the daytoday operation of a clinical reference laboratory including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control in addition state laws mandate proficiency testing which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory in addition certain states require licensing of outofstate laboratories in order to receive and test specimens from those tests if a laboratory is out of compliance with such statutory or regulatory standards the state may suspend limit revoke or annul the laboratory’s license censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties 

pharmaceutical regulation in the united states 

fda has determined that the primary mode of action for paragard is the drug component and is therefore regulated by fda’s center for drug evaluation and research as a drug product 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications nda withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold untitled letters warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 

any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including manufacturing periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising promotion drug shortage reporting compliance with any postapproval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as phase 4 clinical trials a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and surveillance recordkeeping and reporting requirements including adverse experiences 

after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to further testing to new clinical investigation requirements and prior fda review and approval there also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices or cgmps and other requirements which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our thirdparty manufacturers 

changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented or fda notification fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmps specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any thirdparty manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations imposition of postmarket studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program among other consequences 

the fda closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda physicians in their independent professional medical judgement may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda we however are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling in addition the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products including samples is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution the drug supply chain security act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and serialization 

failure to comply with any of the fda’s requirements which are subject to new legislation and change could result in significant adverse enforcement actions these include a variety of administrative or 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

judicial sanctions such as refusal to approve pending applications license suspension or revocation withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials warning letters untitled letters cyber letters modification of promotional materials or labeling product recalls product seizures or detentions refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution debarment injunctions fines consent decrees corporate integrity agreements refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment it is also possible that failure to comply with the fda’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws as well as state consumer protection laws any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity among other adverse consequences 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical studies and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies or notified bodies in other countries must approve or certify new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval or certification in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union eu united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements coopervision maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products and coopersurgical maintains iso 13485 certification for medical devices and iso 15189 certification for the genomics laboratories a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device regulation and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

regulation of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the european union 

the eu has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design manufacture clinical investigations conformity assessment labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices including in vitro diagnostic medical devices ivds 

i n the eu until may 25 2021 medical devices were regulated by the council directive 9342eec or the eu medical devices directive which has been repealed and replaced by regulation eu no 2017745 the eu mdr unlike directives regulations are directly applicable in all eu member states without the need for member states to implement into national law ivds are currently regulated by the eu in vitro diagnostic medical devices directive directive 9879ec the ivdd however on april 5 2017 regulation eu 2017746 of the european parliament and of the council on ivds and repealing directive 9879ec and commission decision 2010227eu the eu ivdr was adopted to establish a modernized and more robust eu legislative framework with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety the eu ivdr will become applicable five years after publication on 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

may 26 2022 however on october 14 2021 the european commission proposed a “progressive” rollout of the eu ivdr to prevent disruption in the supply of ivds consequently if the european parliament and council adopt the proposed regulation the eu ivdr will fully apply on may 26 2022 but there will be a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices depending on their risk classification before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation 

both the eu mdr and ivdr seek to 

• strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available 

• establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

• establish explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities 

• impose an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation 

• improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk 

• set up a central database eudamed to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu and 

• strengthen rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices that may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market 

in the eu there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices including ivds however all medical devices including ivds placed on the eu market must respectively meet general safety and performance requirements for medical devices and essential requirements for ivds including that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that during normal conditions of use it is suitable for its intended purpose medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and where applicable other persons provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art 

compliance with the essential or general safety and performance requirements is a prerequisite for european conformity marking or ce mark without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the eu to demonstrate compliance with the essential or general safety and performance requirements medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i or general ivds where the manufacturer can selfassess the conformity of its products with the essential or general safety and performance requirements except for any parts which relate to sterility metrology or reuse aspects of a medical device a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body notified bodies are independent organizations designated by eu member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market a notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards—iso 134852016 for quality management systems—conform to these requirements if satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the essential or general safety and performance requirements the notified body issues a certificate of conformity which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity the manufacturer may then apply the ce mark to the device which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the eu 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

throughout the term of the certificate of conformity the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements in particular there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificates 

all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the eu must comply with the eu medical device vigilance system under this system serious incidents and field safety corrective actions fscas must be reported to the relevant authorities of the eu member states manufacturers are required to take fscas to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market an fsca may include the recall modification exchange destruction or retrofitting of the device 

the advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth by eu directives only devices that are cemarked may be marketed and advertised in the eu in accordance with their intended purpose directive 2006114ec concerning misleading and comparative advertising and directive 200529ec on unfair commercial practices while not specific to the advertising of medical devices also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules for example requiring that advertisements are evidenced balanced and not misleading specific requirements are defined at the national level eu member states laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices which vary between jurisdictions may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals 

in the eu regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and if necessary unannounced inspections of companies as well as suppliers andor subcontractors and where necessary the facilities of professional users failure to comply with regulatory requirements as applicable could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions as appropriate regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions including untitled or warning letters fines consent decrees injunctions or civil or criminal penalties 

both coopervision and coopersurgical have been actively deploying regulatory and compliance initiatives designed to allow the continued ability to sell and market their respective products in the eu under the eu mdr and ivdr 

regulation of laboratory developed tests in the european union 

in the eu laboratory developed tests ldts are exempt from the regulations that govern medical devices and ivds under certain conditions according to article 15 of the ivdd “this directive shall not apply to devices manufactured and used only within the same health institution and on the premises of their manufacture or used on premises in the immediate vicinity without having been transferred to another legal entity” article 15 further provides that this exemption does not affect the right of an eu member state from imposing “appropriate protection requirements” in order to fall within this exemption under the ivdd medical devices including laboratory developed tests must be designed and used within such health institution which may include hospitals laboratories and public health institutions that support the healthcare system andor address patient needs but do not treat or care for patients directly on a nonindustrial scale without being released into the market however the legal framework for applying the exemption under the ivdd to laboratory developed tests is not entirely clear as the ivdd does not specify what nonindustrial scale would be 

when the eu ivdr comes into effect it may provide greater clarity on the regulation of ldts under the eu ivdr the general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i of the eu ivdr are also applicable to devices manufactured and used only within health institutions manufacturers of such devices are required to demonstrate conformity with the general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i of the eu ivdr through performance evaluations in accordance with article 56 of the eu ivdr and the manufacturer’s quality management system framework 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the eu ivdr provides that the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i of the eu ivdr do not generally apply to devices manufactured and used only within health institutions established in the eu provided that the conditions set out in article 5 of the eu ivdr are met under the eu ivdr health institutions may manufacture modify and use medical devices within such institutions thereby addressing the specific needs of target patient groups on a nonindustrial scale under such circumstances where the ldts are manufactured and used strictly within health institutions which may include hospitals laboratories public health institutions that support the healthcare system andor address patient needs but do not treat or care for patients directly ldts would continue to be exempt from regulation however compared to the previous regulatory regime the exemptions for ldts will overall be narrowed as even in relation to ldts health institutions among others are required to provide information upon request on the use of such devices to their competent authority and each health institution will have to draw up a declaration which it will make publicly available if these conditions are not met andor diagnostic tests are manufactured and used only within health institutions but “on an industrial scale” such tests will qualify as in vitro diagnostic medical devices with the full applicability of the eu ivdr ldts regulated by the eu ivdr will be subject to conformity assessments and inspections by the relevant competent authority who will also review the declarations and statements made by the health institutions in relation to their ldts our current and future tests will need to be analyzed as to whether any or all of them would qualify for an exemption under article 5 of eu ivdr or otherwise we will be required to comply with various certification and documentation criteria and we may be subject to conformity assessments and inspections given that the eu ivdr has not yet come into effect it remains to be seen how it and particularly the exemptions it grants under article 5 of eu ivdr may be further interpreted and clarified in the future 

the aforementioned eu rules are generally applicable in the european economic area eea which consists of the 27 eu member states plus norway liechtenstein and iceland 

the impact of brexit 

the eu ivdr will not be applicable in great britain england scotland and wales due to brexit existing eu directives governing all medical devices including in vitro diagnostic medical devices have been given effect in domestic law through the medical devices regulations 2002 si 2002 no 618 as amended this means that from january 1 2021 the great britain route to market is still based on the requirements derived from the preexisting eu legislation as a standalone regulatory body the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra is responsible for regulating medical devices in great britain the mhra may choose to align with the eu ivdr going forward with respect to ldts respectively or retain regulatory flexibility through domestic legislation which will continue to be monitored the uk government has introduced a new medicines and medical devices bill which allows the secretary of state to amend or supplement the medical devices regulations 2002 si 2002618 in addition the trade deal between the uk and the eu generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance including market surveillance enforcement activities and measures standardization related activities exchanges of officials and coordinated product recalls as such processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities 

ce marks issued by eurecognized notified bodies will continue to be valid in great britain until june 30 2023 for medical devices placed on the great britain market after this period the uk conformity assessment ukca marking will be mandatory the eu no longer recognizes conformity assessment activities performed by uk notified bodies for medical devices placed on the market since january 1 2021 notified bodies must be located in an european union member state or territory where there is a mutual recognition agreement mra there is currently no such mra between the uk and the eu

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral false claims laws and physician payment transparency laws and regulations 

in the united states the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving any remuneration directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for the purchase lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the antikickback statute instead the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a casebycase basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances in addition a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

the federal physician selfreferral prohibitions commonly known as the stark law generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the medicare or medicaid programs for certain designated health services including clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service or any member of such physician’s immediate family has a financial interest such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition these prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral 

the federal false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute or stark law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims act 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control or custody of any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by trick scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation also many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs or in several states apply regardless of the payor 

in addition the federal government as part of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals and teaching hospitals as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians as defined by statute and their immediate family members certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws 

in the eu many member states have adopted specific antigift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices including ivds in particular visàvis healthcare professionals and organizations additionally there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities in addition many eu member states have adopted national “sunshine acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements often on an annual basis similar to the requirements in the united states on medical device manufacturers certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs 

violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including fines and civil monetary penalties the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements which impose among other things rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies similar sanctions and penalties as well as imprisonment also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies 

coverage and reimbursement 

market acceptance and sales of our coopersurgical products to our customers who primarily consist of hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics will depend on the availability of payor coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement for the procedures using our products by government insurance programs and other thirdparty payors payor coverage and reimbursement for procedures using medical devices in the united states and international markets vary significantly by country 

in the united states our currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in surgical procedures and if covered by thirdparty payors are paid for as part of the procedure outside of the united states there are many reimbursement programs through private payors as well as government programs in some countries government reimbursement is the predominant program available to patients and hospitals our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities private health insurers and other thirdparty payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used failure by physicians hospitals surgery centers fertility clinics and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in government and private thirdparty payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies 

we believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services all thirdparty reimbursement programs are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring second opinions prior to major surgery careful review of bills encouragement of healthier lifestyles and other preventative services and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare in addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels thirdparty payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts this includes routine updates to payments to physicians hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used these updates could directly impact the demand for our products 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

with respect to drug coverage and reimbursement thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and costeffectiveness of drugs in addition to their safety and efficacy adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit sales of paragard or any other drug product that receives approval thirdparty payors may not consider our products to be medically necessary or costeffective compared to other available therapies or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development additionally decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product 

in international markets including the eu reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures there can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be covered for a specific indication that our products will be considered costeffective by thirdparty payors that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the thirdparty payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably for example in the eu member states impose controls on whether products are reimbursable by national or regional health service providers and on the prices at which devices are reimbursed under staterun healthcare schemes more and more local product specific reimbursement law is applied as an overlay to medical device regulation which has provided an additional layer of clearance requirement 

healthcare reform 

in the united states there has been and continues to be several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect the profitable sale of product candidates 

among policy makers and payors in the united states there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs improving quality andor expanding access passed in march 2010 the aca substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the pharmaceutical medical device and clinical laboratory industries among other things the aca increased the minimum level of medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 151 to 231 required collection of rebates for drugs paid by medicaid managed care organizations required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer pointofsale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d imposed a nondeductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled infused instilled implanted or injected expanded eligibility criteria for medicaid programs creates a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research and established a center for medicare innovation at the cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending potentially including prescription drug spending 

since its enactment there have been judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the aca on june 17 2021 the us supreme court rejected a challenge by a group of states and individuals to the constitutionality of the aca however it is still unclear how other efforts to challenge repeal or replace the aca will impact the law 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted these changes included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of the temporary suspension from may 1 2020 through december 31 2021 unless additional congressional action is taken in addition on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

moreover there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products individual states in the united states have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing in addition regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs furthermore there has been increased interest by thirdparty payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices 

we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

data privacy and security 

numerous state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of personal information including healthrelated information in the united states numerous federal and state laws and regulations including data breach notification laws health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners for example the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 and regulations implemented thereunder collectively hipaa imposes privacy security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers health plans and health care clearinghouses known as covered entities as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating receiving maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities entities that are found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance further entities that knowingly obtain use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a hipaa covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by hipaa may be subject to criminal penalties 

even when hipaa does not apply according to the federal trade commission ftc violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section 5a of the federal trade commission act the ftc expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable

and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities 

in addition certain state and nonus laws such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr govern the privacy and security of personal data including healthrelated data in certain circumstances some of which are more stringent than hipaa and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect thus complicating compliance efforts failure to comply with these laws where applicable can result in the imposition of significant civil andor criminal penalties and private litigation for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to california residents including the right to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach in europe the gdpr went into effect in may 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the eea and the uk in addition the gdpr increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the eea to the united states and other jurisdictions that the european commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu cjeu limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the eea to the united states by invalidating the euus privacy shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the eea indeed while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place however the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain the cjeu went on to state that if a competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer the european commission has published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the eea the revised clauses must be used for relevant new data transfers starting september 27 2021 existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by december 27 2022 there is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to noneea entities subject to the gdpr 

companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company whichever is greater 

additionally following the uk’s withdrawal from the eea and the eu and the expiry of the transition period companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the uk national law the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of annual global turnover the european commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the uk enabling data transfers from eu member states to the uk without additional safeguards however the uk adequacy decision will automatically expire in june 2025 unless the european commission reassesses and renewsextends that decision and remains under review by the commission during this period the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear and it is unclear how uk data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to long term and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated in the long term

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the future by the global covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally and has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption within the markets in which we operate the pandemic has adversely affected and is likely to further adversely affect nearly all aspects of our business and markets including our sales operations cash flow and workforce and the operations of our customers suppliers vendors and business partners among other things many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures in response to the pandemic and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits which has resulted in reduced demand for and sales of our products and services 

if the covid19 pandemic continues and conditions worsen our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in numerous ways including but not limited to decreased net sales from sales of our products and services due to customer facility closures restricted access and reduced patient visits exams and elective medical procedures disruption in the manufacture and distribution of our products including increased manufacturing and distribution costs reduced manufacturing capacity and inadequate inventory levels increased risk of inventory that may expire writeoffs or obsolescence of inventory equipment or other assets disruptions to or increased costs from our raw material and product suppliers and broader supply chain and distribution systems delays in our clinical trials which could negatively impact our new product pipeline milestones and regulatory clearances approvals or certifications extended delays in or defaults on payments of outstanding receivables insolvency of customers suppliers vendors and business partners an inability to access lending capital markets and other sources of liquidity when needed on reasonable terms or at all an inability to comply with financial covenants in our debt agreements and future restructuring impairment and other charges 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain difficult to predict and largely outside of our control including but not limited to the continued spread duration and severity of the pandemic outbreak the occurrence spread duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks including the emergence and spread of variants of the covid19 virus the impact on our customers and suppliers the actions taken by the us and foreign governments to contain the pandemic address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity the occurrence duration and severity of a global regional or national recession depression or other sustained adverse market event and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2021 and 2020 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

• we may find it difficult to manage the effects of the ongoing covid19 pandemic on our ability to operate internationally and for our employees to travel internationally 

• we may have difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 

• we may have difficulty gaining market share in countries such as japan and china because of regulatory restrictions and customer preferences 

• we may find it difficult to grow in emerging markets such as china india russia brazil and other developing nations due to among other things customer acceptance undeveloped andor unfamiliar distribution channels regulatory restrictions and changes and business knowledge of these new markets 

• foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions including the tariffs enacted by the chinese government on certain us goods the scope and duration of which remain uncertain 

• we may find it difficult to comply with a variety of united states and foreign legal compliance and regulatory requirements such as the foreign corrupt practices act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the united kingdom bribery act international data security and privacy laws eu mdr and ivdr 

• we may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results 

• foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states 

• failure to comply with united states department of commerce and other nations importexport controls may result in fines andor penalties 

• general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy 

• natural disasters pandemics such as covid19 war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts may cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability resulting in decreased demand for our products adversely affecting our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or causing interruptions in our supply chain 

• foreign governments may adopt regulations including those similar to the eu mdr and ivdr or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities including but not limited to increased enforcement of potentially conflicting and ambiguous antibribery laws 

• we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems and 

• we may be subject to unforeseen economic or political events in certain countries that may have an impact on our customers ability or preferences to buy our products 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging particularly in light of the covid19 pandemic foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal 2021 uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners if our customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results our global business may be affected by local economic conditions including inflation increasing labor costs recession and currency exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect the cost to manufacture and provide our products and services and the demand for such products and services there is no guarantee that we will be able to fully absorb any such additional costs in the prices for our products and services 

coopervision and coopersurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains due to this trend global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations in fiscal 2021 coopervision acquired a privately held medical device company and a privatelyheld uk contact lenses manufacturer in fiscal 2020 coopervision acquired a privatelyheld us contact lens manufacturer focusing on orthok lenses in fiscal 2021 coopersurgical acquired three privatelyheld medical device companies and one privatelyheld ivf cryostorage software solutions company in fiscal 2020 coopersurgical acquired a privatelyheld distributor of ivf medical devices and systems risks we could face with respect to these acquisitions include 

• failure to successfully obtain the anticipated revenues margins and earnings benefits 

• difficulties in and expenses related to the integration of the operations technologies products and personnel of the acquired company and establishment of appropriate accounting controls and reporting procedures and other regulatory compliance procedures including but not limited to thirdparty compliance and due diligence 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

• increased leverage and the risk of lack of access to available financing including financing for the acquisition or refinancing of debt owed by us on a timely basis and on reasonable terms 

• risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 

• potential loss of employees 

• an inability to identify and consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 

• diversion of managements attention away from other business concerns 

• risks of the acquired company’s noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations 

• expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations of the acquired company 

• expenses including restructuring expenses to shutdown our own locations or terminate our employees 

• application of and compliance with new and unfamiliar regulatory frameworks such as pharmaceutical regulation applicable to our paragard iud 

• failure to successfully obtain or maintain reimbursements under the thirdparty payor plans including but not limited to governmental programs due to complex reporting and payment obligations 

• a dilution of earnings per share and 

• risks inherent in accounting allocations and the risk that we are required to record significant adjustments to the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period 

the uk’s withdrawal from the eu may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations with significant business operations in europe including in the uk following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the uk the uk formally withdrew from the eu and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the eu the agreement which is being applied provisionally from january 1 2021 until it is ratified by the european parliament and the council of the european union addresses trade economic arrangements law enforcement judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution among other things because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the uk and the eu as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal 

these developments or the perception that any related developments could occur have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets and may significantly reduce global market liquidity restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings have been and may continue to be subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about future uk laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements tax and customs laws intellectual property rights environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws employment laws and transport laws could decrease foreign direct investment in the uk increase costs and disrupt supply chains 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or constrained idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related work stoppages technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or similar foreign requirements or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely constrained excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions unexpected demand inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability capital investments customer service levels and nearterm financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in costa rica hungary puerto rico the united kingdom and the united states with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in costa rica the united kingdom and the united states with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world in november 2017 coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to obtain required regulatory approvals validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of belgium hungary the united kingdom and the united states and various smaller international distribution sites coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in the united states and the netherlands any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties challenges related to system implementation destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or those of our thirdparty service providers or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm 

security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers or partners the size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are increasing in their frequency levels of persistence levels of sophistication and intensity and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely which may create additional opportunities for 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in addition to unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal data confidential information intellectual property or other sensitive information such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and ransomware and may use a variety of methods including denialofservice attacks social engineering and other means to attain such unauthorized access or acquisition or otherwise affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality integrity and availability of information like many other companies we experience attempted cybersecurity actions on a frequent basis and the frequency of such attempts could increase in the future while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches the techniques used by cybercriminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources including outside groups such as external service providers organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies we cannot assure that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns data leakages or breaches in our systems or those of our thirdparty services providers or partners any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing new enterprise resource planning erp systems at coopervision and coopersurgical implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

we rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials packaging materials and components mechanical equipment and some finished goods we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products we also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from oem suppliers supply of these goods items and materials is protected by contractual agreements availability of alternative suppliers andor safety stocks however if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods items or materials to us on a timely basis or at all for any reason 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products for example among other situations some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by few sole suppliers and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our supply chain and our cost of goods also may be negatively impacted by unanticipated price increases due to factors such as inflation including wage inflation or to supply restrictions beyond our control or the control of our suppliers 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

• be expensive and time consuming to prosecute or defend 

• result in a finding that we do not have certain intellectual property rights or that such rights lack sufficient scope or strength 

• divert managements attention and resources or 

• require us to license our intellectual property 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states the united kingdom and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states the united kingdom and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies as well as other third parties 

may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

• be expensive and time consuming to defend 

• cause us to cease making licensing or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 

• require us to redesign or reengineer our products if feasible 

• divert managements attention and resources or 

• require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product component or process 

we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals or certifications will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

• acceptance of our products by eye care and health care practitioners 

• the cost competitiveness of our products 

• consumer reluctance to try and use a new product 

• regulatory and legislative requirements 

• adequate coverage and reimbursement by thirdparty payors 

• the earlier release of competitive products such as new silicone hydrogel products into the market by our competitors and the emergence of newer and more competitive products 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our largest competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon inc and bausch health companies inc may have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogelbased products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

capabilities and our ability to secure adequate supply of materials used in production at reasonable costs our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision’s strategy or interfere with its customers’ relationships and loyalty for example more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner coopervision’s failure to adapt to the threats posed by these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens health market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality access to local markets based on regulatory clearances price and effective communication of product information to physicians hospitals patients and ivf clinics coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its family health care market areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care and diagnostics testing industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or certifications or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopervision both internally and externally with third parties invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses while much of coopervision’s research and development activities are performed internally it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties coopersurgical has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical also has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organic growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects greater dependence on and reduced control over thirdparty deliverables the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval or certification and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals certifications or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval or certification in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted these regulations include for example regulations enacted in the european union such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products our coopersurgical division manufactures these and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in japan china and various states of the us may require us to redesign certain products to ensure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 

environmental social and corporate governance esg issues including those related to climate change and sustainability may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

there is an increasing focus from certain investors customers consumers employees and other stakeholders concerning esg matters additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ esg practices continue to grow if our esg practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor customer consumer employee or other stakeholders evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship support for local communities board of director and employee diversity human capital management employee health and safety practices product quality supply chain management corporate governance and transparency our reputation brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us 

customers consumers investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues including climate change energy and water use plastic waste and other sustainability concerns concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials in particular may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment changing 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

customer and consumer preferences or increased regulatory requirements may result in increased demands or requirements regarding plastics and packaging materials including singleuse and nonrecyclable plastic products and packaging other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability or increased customer and consumer concerns or perceptions whether accurate or inaccurate regarding the effects of substances present in certain of our products complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing operating or product development costs 

if we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fail to meet evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and concerns regarding esg issues investors may reconsider their capital investment in our company and customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business or financial condition 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have antitakeover effects 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal state and foreign laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information including health related information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use privacy confidentiality security availability and integrity of individually identifiable information including protected health information phi for example hipaa establishes national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services including another one of our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed and to adopt administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect phi when we are acting as a business associate our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us  known as business associate agreements  that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations however our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins viruses hackers and other potential sources of security breaches in addition we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws andor under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business 

even when hipaa does not apply according to the ftc violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section 5a of the federal trade commission act the ftc expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities 

further california enacted the ccpa on june 28 2018 which went into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation although there are limited exemptions for healthrelated information including clinical trial data the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability some observers have noted that the ccpa could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level and if passed such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than united states covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu and eea member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations for example the gdpr went into effect on may 25 2018 and imposes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data of individuals within the eea including for example expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized ie keycoded data mandatory data breach notification requirements handling data subject access requests and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities in addition countries of the eea may impose further obligations relating to the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information in addition the gdpr increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the eea to the united states and other jurisdictions that the european commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the eea to the united states by invalidating the euus privacy shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the eea indeed while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

applicable in the destination country in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place however the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain the cjeu went on to state that if a competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer the european commission has published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the eea the revised clauses must be used for relevant new data transfers from september 27 2021 existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by december 27 2022 we will be required to implement the revised standard contractual clauses in relation to relevant existing contracts and certain additional contracts and arrangements within the relevant time frames there is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to noneea entities subject to the gdpr 

compliance with us and foreign privacy and security laws rules and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts require us to engage in costly compliance exercises restrict our ability to collect use and disclose data or in some cases impact our or our partners’ or suppliers’ ability to operate in certain jurisdictions each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection authorities fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business for example companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company whichever is greater additionally following the uk’s withdrawal from the eea and the eu and the expiry of the transition period companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the uk national law the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of annual global turnover the european commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the uk enabling data transfers from eu member states to the uk without additional safeguards however the uk adequacy decision will automatically expire in june 2025 unless the european commission reassesses and renewsextends that decision and remains under review by the commission during this period the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear and it is unclear how uk data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated in the long term which exposes us to further compliance risk such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the aca of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following 

• establishment of the patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

• payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals physicians and other providers to improve the coordination quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models 

• creation of the independent payment advisory board which has authority to recommend certain changes to reduce medicare spending and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if congress doesnt act on the recommendations 

• establishment of a center for medicare innovation at cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending and 

• an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program to 231 and 13 of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs respectively 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility office and surgical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments will remain in effect until 2030 with the temporary suspension from may 1 2020 through december 31 2021 unless additional action is taken by congress the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer 

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback physician selfreferral false claims and physician payment transparency laws and regulations these laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations including our commercial laboratory operations and how we research market sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval such laws include 

• the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing any remuneration including any kickback bribe or certain rebates directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind in return for either the referral of an individual or the purchase lease or order or arranging for or recommending the purchase lease or order of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal antikickback statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the federal physician selfreferral prohibitions commonly known as the stark law which generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the medicare or medicaid programs for certain designated health services including clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service or any member of such physician’s immediate family has a financial interest such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition these prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral 

• the federal false claims laws including the civil false claims act and civil monetary penalties laws which prohibit among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to the federal government claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government in addition the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute or stark law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act 

• the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• the federal physician payments sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program with certain exceptions to report annually to the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

cms information related to payments and other “transfers of value” made to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by such healthcare professionals and their immediate family members beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified nurse anesthetists and certified nursemidwives and 

• analogous state and foreign laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental thirdparty payors including private insurers and selfpay patients some state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug and device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures some state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products and some state and local laws that require the registration of sales representatives 

in addition federal government price reporting laws among other things require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement andor discounts on our marketed drugs participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts 

violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legislative or regulatory reforms in the united states or the eu may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances approvals or certifications for our products or to manufacture market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained 

from time to time legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis over the last several years the fda has proposed reforms to its 510k clearance process and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510k clearance process for their products 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the fda in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products any new statutes regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for manufacture market or distribute our products we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations statutes legal interpretation or policies when and if promulgated enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future such changes could among other things require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval changes to manufacturing methods recall replacement or discontinuance of our products or additional record keeping 

in addition the eu landscape concerning medical devices including ivds is evolving a new set of two eu regulations have been adopted on april 5 2017 on may 25 2017 the eu mdr entered into force which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive as to the eu ivdr it will become applicable five years after publication on may 26 2022 however on october 14 2021 the european commission proposed a “progressive” rollout of the eu ivdr to prevent disruption in the supply of ivds consequently if the european parliament and council adopt the proposed regulation the eu ivdr will fully apply on may 26 2022 but there will be a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices depending on their risk classification before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation both regulations have been adopted to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eu for medical devices including ivds and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation the new regulations seek to 

• strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available 

• establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

• establish explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities 

• impose an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation 

• improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk 

• set up a central database eudamed to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu and 

• strengthen rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices that may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market 

these modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the eu and eea for example as a result of the transition towards the new regimes notified body review times have lengthened and product introductions could be delayed or canceled additionally only a few notified bodies have been designated for ivdr certification which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 

the euuk trade and cooperation agreement tca came into effect on january 1 2021 the tca does not specifically refer to medical devices however as a result of brexit the eu mdr will not be implemented in the unitedkingdom and previous legislation that mirrored the eu mdr in the uk law has been revoked the regulatory regime for medical devices in great britain england scotland and wales will continue to be based on the requirements derived from current eu legislation and great britain may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the eu mdr going forward ce markings 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

will continue to be recognized in the unitedkingdom and certificates issued by eurecognized notified bodies will be valid in great britain until june 30 2023 for medical devices placed on the market in great britain after this period the uk conformity assessment ukca marking will be mandatory in contrast ukca marking and certificates issued by uk notified bodies will not be recognized on the eu market the tca does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance including market surveillance enforcement activities and measures standardization related activities exchanges of officials and coordinated product recalls or other similar actions for medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries the “rules of origin” criteria will need to be reviewed depending on which countries products will be ultimately sold in manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs the rules for placing medical devices on the northern ireland market will differ from those in great britain these modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to conduct our business in these countries 

our medical device products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance approval or certification which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable domestic or international regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance approval or certification for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products increase the cost of compliance impose additional regulatory requirements on us or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

modifications and enhancements to medical devices also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the fda’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose any marketing approval 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the united states or abroad 

in order to sell our products in the eu our products must respectively comply with general safety and performance requirements of the eu mdr and essential requirements of the ivdd compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the european conformity ce mark to our products without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the eu all medical devices placed on the market in the eu must meet the general safety and performance requirements or the essential requirements laid down in the annexes to the eu mdr and ivdd including that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that during normal conditions of use it is suitable for its intended purpose medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and where applicable other persons provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i or general ivds where the manufacturer can selfassess the conformity of its products with the essential or general safety and performance requirements except for any parts which relate to sterility metrology or reuse aspects of a medical device a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body notified bodies are independent organizations designated by eu member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market a notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards—iso 134852016 for quality management systems—conform to these requirements if satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the essential or general safety and performance requirements the notified body issues a certificate of conformity which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity the manufacturer may then apply the ce mark to the device which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the eu if we fail to remain in compliance with applicable eu laws directives or regulations we would be unable to continue to affix the ce mark to our products which would prevent us from selling them within the eu and eea 

the eu regulatory landscape concerning medical devices including ivds is evolving and the new requirements may have a significant effect on the way we conduct our business in the eu and the eea see risk factor   legislative or regulatory reforms in the united states or the eu may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances approvals or certifications for our products or to manufacture market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained  

from january 1 2021 onwards the mhra becomes the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for great britain england scotland and wales medical device market according to the requirements provided in the medical devices regulations 2002 si 2002 no 618 as amended that sought to give effect to the three preexisting eu directives governing active implantable medical devices general medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices whereas northern ireland continues to be governed by eu rules according to the northern ireland protocol following the end of the brexit transitional period on january 1 2021 new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the mhra but manufacturers will be given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process before being placed on the great britain market the mhra will only register devices where the manufacturer or their uk responsible person has a registered place of business in the uk manufacturers based outside the uk will need to appoint a uk responsible person that has a registered place of business in the uk to register devices with the mhra in line with the grace periods by july 1 2023 in great britain all medical devices will require a ukca mark but ce marks issued by 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

eu notified bodies will remain valid until this time manufacturers may choose to use the ukca mark on a voluntary basis until june 30 2023 however ukca marking will not be recognized in the eu the rules for placing medical devices on the market in northern ireland which is part of the uk differ from those in the rest of the uk compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the ukca mark to our products without which they cannot be sold or marketed in great britain 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications or certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french antigift legislation duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals or certifications and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

we offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldts we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however if there are changes in the fda’s policy or if the fda disagrees that our marketed tests are ldts or that we are marketing our tests outside the scope of the fda’s current policy of enforcement discretion we may become subject to extensive regulatory requirements and may be required to stop selling our existing tests or launching any other tests we may develop and to conduct additional clinical trials or take other actions prior to continuing to market our tests this could significantly increase the costs and expenses of conducting or otherwise harm our business 

legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldt have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldt is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldt our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldt it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldt or new legislation regulations such as the eu ivdr regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our genetic products and to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

in addition changes in the way the eu regulates ldts could result in additional expenses for offering our current and any future tests or possibly delay or suspend development or commercialization of such tests in the eu ldts are exempt from the regulations that govern medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices under certain conditions the ivdd currently governs the exemptions applicable to ldts however the eu regulatory landscape is evolving and when the eu ivdr becomes applicable on may 26 2022 the general safety and performance requirements set out in annex i will also be applicable to devices manufactured and used only within health institutions the exemptions provided under the eu ivdr for ldts remain to be further interpreted and clarified if our tests do not qualify for an exemption we may be subject to the full application of the eu ivdr with respect to some or all of our existing as well as future tests and we would be required to expend additional time and resources to complying with the requirements of the eu ivdr 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our genetic tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia uk human fertilization  embryology association hfea regulating ivf a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratories must be certified under clia and iso 15189 in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in japan the united kingdom and united states and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction 

any sanction imposed under clia its implementing regulations or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure or our failure to renew a clia certificate a state license or accreditation could have a material and adverse effect on our diagnostic testing business operating results and financial condition the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms also has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions including revocation of the clia certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of a cliacertified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory if we were to lose our clia certification or required state licensure we would not be able to operate our clinical laboratory and conduct our tests in full or in particular states which would adversely impact our diagnostic testing business operating results and financial condition 

pricing pressure from our competitors customers and changes in thirdparty coverage and reimbursement may adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our operating results 

competition in our industry has increased as a result of new market entrants new technologies and as more established companies have intensified competitive pricing pressure as a result of these competitive forces we believe there will continue to be pricing pressure in the future because our coopersurgical products are generally purchased by hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

offices and fertility clinics and billed to various thirdparty payors changes in the purchasing behavior of such customers or the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products including as a result of healthcare reform initiatives could create additional pricing pressure on us in addition to these competitive forces we continue to see pricing pressure as our customers introduce new pricing structures into their contracts and agreements including fixed price formulas capitated pricing and structured pricing intended to contain healthcare costs such trends may adversely affect demand for our products and may drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products both of which would negatively affect our operating results 

disruptions at the fda and other government agencies or notified bodies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all which could negatively impact our business 

the ability of the fda foreign agencies and notified bodies to review and clear approve or certify new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels statutory regulatory and policy changes the fda’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and other events that may otherwise affect the fda’s ability to perform routine functions average review times at the fda have fluctuated in recent years as a result in addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable disruptions at the fda and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved drugs and medical devices to be reviewed andor approved by necessary government agencies which would adversely affect our business for example over the last several years including for 35 days beginning on december 22 2018 the us government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the fda have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities 

separately in response to the covid19 pandemic on march 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and on march 18 2020 the fda temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subsequently on july 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to resume certain onsite inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a riskbased prioritization system the fda intends to use this riskbased assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities on may 5 2021 the fda announced its intention to review its inspectional approaches and to establish an agencywide fda inspectional affairs council that will plan and coordinate inspectional activities regulatory authorities outside the united states may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the covid19 pandemic if a prolonged government shutdown occurs or if global health concerns continue to prevent the fda or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections reviews or other regulatory activities it could significantly impact the ability of the fda or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in the eu notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the eu mdr and ivdr only a few notified bodies have been designated so far but the covid19 pandemic has significantly slowed down their designation process without ivdr designation notified bodies may not yet start certifying devices in accordance with the new regulation as only a few notified bodies have been ivdrdesignated they are facing a heavy workload and their review times have lengthened even though a number of notified bodies have been mdrdesignated they are also facing a similar situation this situation could impact the way we conduct our business in the eu and the eea 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to tax 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

determination of the effective tax rate and evaluation of tax positions is uncertain with rapidly changing enactment interpretation and enforcement of tax laws in the us and foreign jurisdictions when tax matters arise several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on our operating results any resolution of a tax matter may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our tax filings by us and foreign tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting guidance and changes in us or foreign tax laws in addition government agencies in foreign jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

other jurisdictions in which we do business could change and any such change could materially and adversely affect our business 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or foreign tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

risks relating to interest and foreign exchange rates debt and equity 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis currently we do not enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances and although we may enter into these types of agreements in the future they would not eliminate that risk entirely 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt from time to time we may use interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our variablerate debt as further described in note 14 financial derivatives and hedging of the consolidated financial statements we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

the uk’s financial conduct authority fca which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 in march 2021 the fca confirmed its intention to stop requiring banks to submit rates required to calculate libor after 2021 however for us dollardenominated usd libor only oneweek and twomonth usd libor will cease to be published after 2021 and all remaining usd libor tenors will continue being published until june 2023 we have multiple debt facilities which bear interest at a variable rate based on the eurodollar libor rate in effect from time to time a change or transition away from libor as a common reference rate in the global financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business our management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding libor we do not expect a material impact on our financial statements related to this transition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

• result in greater interest rate risk and volatility 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds and 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt including our obligation to repay our credit facilities under certain circumstances or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit plan costs 

we sponsor a defined benefit plan for certain employees in the united states this defined benefit plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations

covid19 considerations 

the world health organization categorized the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid19 virus and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid19 virus many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits these factors have had and in the future may have an adverse effect on our sales operating results and cash flows 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we have taken an active role in addressing the ongoing pandemic’s impact on our employees suppliers distribution channels operations and customers including taking precautionary measures such as implementing contingency plans and making operational adjustments as necessary we have taken measures to help ensure the safety of our personnel in all our facilities and we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide

provision for income taxes 

the effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 4991 and 106 respectively the decrease was primarily due to an intragroup transfer of intellectual property as discussed below and remeasurement of the related deferred tax assets caused by the uk enactment of a 25 corporate tax rate the effective tax rate otherwise increased due to changes in the geographical composition of pretax earnings partially offset by changes in foreign earnings subject to us tax 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the intragroup transfer the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2021 would have increased by approximately 960 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2021 would have increased by approximately 262

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements 

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

the world health organization categorized the covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid19 virus and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid19 virus many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits these factors have had and in the future may have an adverse effect on our sales operating results and cash flows 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates particularly as it relates to estimates reliant on forecasts and other assumptions reasonably available to the company and the uncertain future impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments including but not limited to the continued spread duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic the occurrence spread duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks including the emergence and spread of variants of the covid19 virus the actions taken by the us and foreign governments to contain the covid19 pandemic address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity the occurrence duration and severity of a global regional or national recession depression or other sustained adverse market event the impact of the developments described above on our customers and suppliers and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume the accounting matters assessed included but were not limited to 

• allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses 

• the carrying value of inventory 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

• the carrying value of goodwill and other longlived assets 

there was not a material impact to the above estimates in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continually monitor and evaluate the estimates used as additional information becomes available adjustments will be made to these provisions periodically to reflect new facts and circumstances that may indicate that historical experience may not be indicative of current andor future results our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as other factors could result in material changes to the estimates and material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods 

our critical accounting policies include 

• revenue recognition  we recognize revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied generally this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers andor when services are rendered our payment terms are typically between 30 to 120 days provisions for certain rebates sales incentives volume discounts contractual pricing allowances and product returns are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales 

product discounts including certain rebates sales incentives and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer we evaluate contractual terms historical experience and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized our paragard program is subject to medicaid rebates which are estimated at the time of sale based upon the difference between current retail pricing and contractual medicaid pricing and an estimate of the number of units that will be sold to medicaid patients which is informed by historical trends of claim history 

sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data promotional programs such as cooperative advertising arrangements are recorded in the same period as related sales reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates sales incentives volume discounts contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements we currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact 

• valuation of goodwill  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist we account for goodwill evaluate and test goodwill balances for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards we test goodwill impairment in accordance with asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  we perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill that 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets and stockholders equity 

• business combinations  we routinely consummate business combinations results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired including acquired inprocess research and development the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements key assumptions routinely utilized in allocation of purchase price to intangible assets include projected financial information such as revenue projections for companies acquired as of the acquisition date goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 

• income taxes  we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax losses and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we use the fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns that we have determined are not morelikelythannot realizable our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts these tax reserves have been established based on managements assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions all tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations to the extent reasonable and practical we may decide to reduce the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations most of our operations outside the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally our british pound sterling euro and japanese yen denominated debt and receivables denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and from operations in other foreign currencies although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely at october 31 2021 a uniform hypothetical 5 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would have resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease in approximately 396 million in operating income for the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 for additional information see item 1a risk factors   our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results  and note 1 accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rates on our revolving lines of credit and term loans may vary with the federal funds rate and libor we may decrease this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods 

on april 6 2020 we entered into six interest rate swap contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows associated with our variable rate debt the interest rate swap contracts became effective on april 6 2020 and had maturities of seven years or less with a total notional amount of 15 billion the outstanding contracts as of october 31 2021 have a total notional amount of 10 billion we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this time 

we did not have any crosscurrency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts as of october 31 2021 

on november 2 2021 subsequent to the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 the company entered into a 364day 8400 million term loan agreement by and among the company the lenders party thereto and the bank of nova scotia as administrative agent which matures on november 1 2022 the company used part of the funds to partially repay outstanding borrowings under the 2020 revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes see note 15 subsequent events of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on october 16 2020 we entered into a 364day 3500 million term loan agreement by and among us the lenders party thereto and the bank of nova scotia as administrative agent which matured on october 15 2021 at maturity outstanding amounts under this agreement were fully repaid using borrowings under the 2020 revolving credit facility 

on april 1 2020 we entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement the 2020 credit agreement among us coopervision international holding company lp coopersurgical netherlands bv coopervision holding kft the lenders from time to time party thereto and keybank national association as administrative agent the 2020 credit agreement provides for a a multicurrency

revolving credit facility the 2020 revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 129 billion and b a term loan facility the 2020 term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 8500 million each of which unless terminated earlier mature on april 1 2025 the 2020 credit agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement to repay an outstanding term loan and for general corporate purposes at october 31 2021 we had 7426 million available under the 2020 revolving credit facility and 8500 million outstanding under the 2020 term loan facility the interest rate on the 2020 term loan facility was 096 at october 31 2021 

see note 5 debt of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 



our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately 48 million based on average debt outstanding after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts for fiscal 2021 for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors   we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt  and note 1 accounting policies and note 5 debt of the consolidated financial statements for additional information

coopervision and coopersurgical each operate in highly competitive environments both of coopers businesses compete predominantly on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit price service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse lenses and frequently replaced lenses which are designed for twoweek and monthly replacement 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision offers spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision uses three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding we believe this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 the market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new valueadded products such as spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices and add aspherical optical properties andor higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business silicone hydrogel lenses represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity ® brand is coopervisions leading product line in terms of sales under the biofinity ® brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical including biofinity energys ®  toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products 

coopervision markets singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses with a complete line of spherical toric extended toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti ® 1 day brand and singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under our myday ® brand we also compete in the traditional hydrogel singleuse product segment with several lenses including our proclear ® 1 day lenses we believe the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that our competitive silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel product offerings represent an opportunity for our business 

in addition to its silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with other traditional hydrogel products 

coopervision believes that our key accounts which include optical chains global retailers certain buying groups and mass merchandisers are growing faster than the overall market we are focused on supporting the growth of all our customers by investing in selling promotional and advertising activities further we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue providing quality service with our industry leading sku range and customized offerings 

coopervision believes that myopia management opens up an attractive new market for contact lenses with misight coopervision offers the only fda approved product to control the progression of myopia in children coopervision is investing to create this new market by educating eye care practitioners patients and their families which increases awareness 

coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions in fiscal 2020 coopervision completed the acquisition of a privatelyheld us contact lens manufacturer focusing on orthok lenses this acquisition expands coopervision’s specialty eye care portfolio and its leadership in addressing the increasing severity and prevalence of myopia in fiscal 2019 coopervision 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acquired a privatelyheld scleral lens company which expands coopervisions specialty and scleral lens portfolio 

contact lens product sales 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon inc and bausch health companies inc 

coopervisions competitors may have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects including laser vision correction coopervision believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products clariti 1 day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses myday singleuse spherical and toric lenses biofinity monthly spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lenses and avaira vitality tm twoweek spherical and toric lenses coopervision believes the clariti 1 day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market coopervision offers both branded and private label options in contact lenses its private label option is frequently offered as part of a larger customized solution for its customers it also competes in the specialty contact lens space with its fda approved misight 1 day contact lens for myopia management when first prescribed to children ages 812 as well as orthok and scleral lenses 

in addition to a broad offering of silicone hydrogel and specialty contact lenses coopervision competes with different manufacturing processes which allow it to produce a broad range of spheres toric and multifocal lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low

coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products and services focused on advancing the health of women babies and families through a diversified portfolio of products and services including medical devices fertility genomics diagnostics and contraception we offer quality products innovative technologies and superior services to health care professionals and patients worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with health care professionals to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to diagnostic tests to sophisticated instruments and equipment to bring new products to market the result is a broad portfolio of products and services that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that health care professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of womens health and reproductive issues

in fiscal 2020 coopersurgical acquired a privatelyheld distributor of ivf medical devices and systems in fiscal 2019 coopersurgical acquired a privatelyheld us medical device company that develops mechanical surgical solutions for skin closure we intend to continue investing in coopersurgicals business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of family health fertility and diagnostics 

market for womens and family reproductive health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for family health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to women’s health provider offices in the united states to increase over the next decade from adolescent care to geriatrics there is increased awareness of women’s health issues during the reproductive years fertility awareness and family planning are key areas of focus coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as infertility rates increase and awareness of and access to services expand the attention in maternity care to improving the safety and efficacy of obstetrical care continues as we expect an increase in the population of women over the age of 65 office visits focused around abnormal bleeding incontinence and menopause will likely increase 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the continued migration of obgyn health care professionals away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

recent trends in the united states market include the development of more costeffective health care delivery models including moving treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for our medical devices

most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage record keeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either premarket notification to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices subject to different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are devices with the lowest risk and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation qsr facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are moderate risk devices which are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and amendments to the fda reauthorization act mdufa iv unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions require payment of user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to substantially higher user fees under mdufa iv than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a class i or class ii device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device a predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a pma a device that was legally marketed in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 a preamendments device and for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of a pma a device that has been reclassified from class iii to class ii or i or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510k premarket notification process the fda aims to make substantial equivalence determinations following receipt of a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires additional information to support substantial equivalence if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate the device is automatically designated as a class iii device the device sponsor must fulfill 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or depending on the modification pma approval or de novo classification the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda may require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or until premarket approval is obtained or a de novo classification request is granted in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

over the last several years the fda has proposed reforms to its 510k clearance process and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510k clearance process for their products for example in november 2018 fda officials announced forthcoming steps that the fda intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under section 510k of the fdca among other things the fda announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510k pathway toward the use of newer predicates these proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510k clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted and the fda may work with congress to implement such proposals through legislation 

more recently in september 2019 the fda published updated guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain wellunderstood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510k clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the fda thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process the fda intends to develop and maintain a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop productspecific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents where feasible 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures or if the device has been previously classified as class iii unless otherwise 510k exempt the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical nonclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

following receipt of a pma application the fda conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review if it is not the agency will refuse to file the pma if it is the fda will accept the application for filing and begin the review the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data nonclinical data or 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicants response to deficiencies communicated by the fda the fda considers a pma or pma supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an fda request for information eg major deficiency letter within 180 days after the fda issues such request also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr which among other things requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the pma constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended uses the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval the fda may also condition approval of a pma application on some form of postmarket surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use in such cases the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the fda on the clinical status of those patients failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the pma process pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a pma application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials for medical devices 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required to obtain clearance of a 510k premarket notification these trials may require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda depending on the device if the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health then the device sponsor is not required to submit an ide application to the fda before initiating human clinical trials but must still comply with abbreviated ide requirements when conducting such trials a significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted used in supporting or sustaining human life substantially important in diagnosing curing mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject if the device presents a “significant risk” to human health the sponsor must submit an ide application to the fda and obtain ide approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials the ide application which includes a clinical study protocol must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks to human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless the fda notifies the company that the investigation may not begin if the fda determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an ide for which it requires modification the fda may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device clinical studies must be approved by and conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board irb for each clinical site the irb is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the study and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the study there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation of medical devices 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations which require changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections for cause by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements which are subject to new legislation and change can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

we provide certain genetic testing laboratory services in the united states under the fdca and the fda’s regulatory framework in vitro diagnostic devices ivds are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases such as cancer or other conditions the fda considers laboratory developed tests ldts to be a subset of ivds which are intended for clinical use and are designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced certain applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldts 

even under its current enforcement discretion policy the fda has issued warning letters to ivd manufacturers for commercializing laboratory tests that were purported to be ldts but that the fda alleged failed to meet the definition of an ldt or otherwise were not subject to the fda’s policy on enforcement discretion because they presented a potential safety risk additionally the fda could change its policy of enforcement discretion for ldts even without legislation for example in recent years the fda has stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to ldts specifically on july 31 2014 the fda notified congress of its intent to modify in a riskbased manner its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to ldts on october 3 2014 the fda issued two draft guidance documents entitled “framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests ldts” or the framework guidance and “fda notification and medical device reporting for ldts” or the reporting guidance the framework guidance stated that fda intended to modify its policy of 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

enforcement discretion with respect to ldts in a riskbased manner consistent with the classification of medical devices generally in classes i through iii the reporting guidance would have further enabled the fda to collect information regarding the ldts currently being offered for clinical use through a notification process as well as to enforce its regulations for reporting safety issues and collecting information on any known or suspected adverse events related to the use of an ldt the fda halted finalization of this guidance in november 2016 to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach for ldts and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution in january 2017 the fda issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to ldt regulation 

legislative and administrative proposals proposing to amend the fda’s oversight of ldts have been introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will continue to be introduced from time to time for example key congressional committees with jurisdiction over fda matters have indicated an interest in continuing negotiations on potential legislation regarding ldts in march 2020 the valid act was introduced in the house and an identical version of the bill was introduced in the us senate if passed in its current form the valid act would create a new category of medical products separate from medical devices called “in vitro clinical tests” or ivcts as proposed the bill would establish a riskbased approach to imposing requirements related to premarket review quality systems and labeling requirements on all ivcts including ldts but would create exemptions for certain ldts marketed before the effective date of the bill though other regulatory requirements may apply such as registration and adverse event reporting it is unclear whether the valid act or any other legislative proposals including any proposals to reduce fda oversight of ldts would be passed by congress or signed into law by the president depending on the approach adopted under any potential legislation certain ldts could become subject to some form of premarket review potentially with a transition period for compliance and a grandfathering provision moreover in august 2020 the us department of health and human services issued a rescission order stating that the fda will not require premarket review of ldts absent changes in policy implemented through formal noticeandcomment rulemaking procedures the degree to which this rescission order will affect fda’s enforcement discretion policy or its oversight over ldts remains unclear 

if congress does not take action in connection with the valid act or other ldt legislation it is possible that the fda could change its regulatory policy governing ldts in a way that could require that our currently marketed genetic tests and any future products that we anticipate marketing as ldts comply with certain additional fda requirements 

however the ivdr will regulate the testing of human embryos which will be classified as class c in addition even though we commercialize our tests as ldts our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda 

as we operate a genetic testing laboratory we are required to hold certain federal state and local licenses certifications and permits to conduct our business under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or clia we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations including test processes personnel facilities administration equipment maintenance recordkeeping quality systems and proficiency testing we have current certification under clia to perform testing at our new jersey facility to renew our clia certificate we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards the regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time and any such changes could have a material effect on our business penalties for noncompliance with clia requirements include suspension limitation or revocation of the laboratory’s clia certificate as well as a directed plan of correction state onsite monitoring civil money penalties civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under clia licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under state law such laws establish standards for the daytoday operation of a clinical reference laboratory including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control in addition state laws mandate proficiency testing which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory in addition certain states require licensing of outofstate laboratories in order to receive and test specimens from those tests if a laboratory is out of compliance with such statutory or regulatory standards the state may suspend limit revoke or annul the laboratory’s license censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties 

pharmaceutical regulation 

fda has determined that the primary mode of action for paragard is the drug component and is therefore regulated by fda’s center for drug evaluation and research as a drug product 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications nda withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold untitled letters warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 

any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including manufacturing periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising promotion drug shortage reporting compliance with any postapproval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as phase 4 clinical trials a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and surveillance recordkeeping and reporting requirements including adverse experiences 

after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to further testing to new clinical investigation requirements and prior fda review and approval there also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices or cgmps and other requirements which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our thirdparty manufacturers 

changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented or fda notification fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmps specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any thirdparty manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations imposition of postmarket studies or clinical 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program among other consequences 

the fda closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda physicians in their independent professional medical judgement may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda we however are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling in addition the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products including samples is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution the drug supply chain security act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and serialization 

failure to comply with any of the fda’s requirements which are subject to new legislation and change could result in significant adverse enforcement actions these include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as refusal to approve pending applications license suspension or revocation withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials warning letters untitled letters cyber letters modification of promotional materials or labeling product recalls product seizures or detentions refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution debarment injunctions fines consent decrees corporate integrity agreements refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment it is also possible that failure to comply with the fda’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws as well as state consumer protection laws any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity among other adverse consequences 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies in other countries must approve new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements coopervision maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products and coopersurgical maintains iso 13485 certification for medical devices and iso 15189 certification for the genomics laboratories a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

in may 2017 the mdr regulation 2017745 was adopted the mdr was originally scheduled to become applicable three years after publication in may 2020 however due to the covid 19 pandemic the enforcement date was delayed by 12 months the new enforcement date is may 26 2021 once applicable the new regulations will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability and additional post market surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr will require recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards further products sold as ivds in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec a new regulation the ivdr eu 2017746 the ivdr has been released and will become fully enforceable in 2022 these regulations include requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

both coopervision and coopersurgical have been actively deploying regulatory and compliance initiatives designed to allow the continued ability to sell and market their respective products in the eu under the mdr and the ivdr 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral false claims laws and physician payment transparency laws and regulations 

in the united states the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving any remuneration directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for the purchase lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the antikickback statute instead the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a casebycase basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances in addition a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

the federal physician selfreferral prohibitions commonly known as the stark law generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the medicare or medicaid programs for certain designated health services including clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service or any member of such physician’s immediate family has a financial interest such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition these prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral 

the federal false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government in addition a claim including items or 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute or stark law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims act 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control or custody of any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by trick scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation also many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs or in several states apply regardless of the payor 

in addition the federal government as part of the affordable care act the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals and teaching hospitals as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians as defined by statute and their immediate family members certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws 

violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including fines and civil monetary penalties the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements which impose among other things rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies similar sanctions and penalties as well as imprisonment also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies 

coverage and reimbursement 

market acceptance and sales of our coopersurgical products to our customers who primarily consist of hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics will depend on the availability of payor coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement for the procedures using our products by government insurance programs and other thirdparty payors payor coverage and reimbursement for procedures using medical devices in the united states and international markets vary significantly by country 

in the united states our currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in surgical procedures and if covered by thirdparty payors are paid for as part of the procedure outside of the united states there are many reimbursement programs through private payors as well as government programs in some countries government reimbursement is the predominant program available to patients and hospitals our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities private health insurers and other thirdparty payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used failure by physicians hospitals surgery centers fertility clinics and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in government and private thirdparty payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services all thirdparty reimbursement programs are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring second opinions prior to major surgery careful review of bills encouragement of healthier lifestyles and other preventative services and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare in addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels thirdparty payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts this includes routine updates to payments to physicians hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used these updates could directly impact the demand for our products 

with respect to drug coverage and reimbursement thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and costeffectiveness of drugs in addition to their safety and efficacy adoption of price controls and costcontainment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit sales of paragard or any other drug product that receives approval thirdparty payors may not consider our products to be medically necessary or costeffective compared to other available therapies or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development additionally decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for any product or a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product 

healthcare reform 

in the united states there has been and continues to be several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect the profitable sale of product candidates 

among policy makers and payors in the united states there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs improving quality andor expanding access in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act or aca was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the pharmaceutical medical device and clinical laboratory industries among other things the aca increased the minimum level of medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 151 to 231 required collection of rebates for drugs paid by medicaid managed care organizations required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer pointofsale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d imposed a nondeductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled infused instilled implanted or injected expanded eligibility criteria for medicaid programs creates a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research and established a center for medicare innovation at the cms to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower medicare and medicaid spending potentially including prescription drug spending 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

since its enactment there have been judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the affordable care act on march 2 2020 the us supreme court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review the constitutionality of the aca although it is unclear when or how the supreme court will rule it is also unclear how other efforts to challenge repeal or replace the aca will impact the law 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted these changes included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 unless additional congressional action is taken in addition on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

moreover there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products individual states in the united states have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing in addition regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs furthermore there has been increased interest by thirdparty payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices 

we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures 

data privacy and security 

numerous state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of personal information including healthrelated information in the united states numerous federal and state laws and regulations including data breach notification laws health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection use disclosure and protection of healthrelated and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners for example the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 and regulations implemented thereunder collectively hipaa imposes privacy security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers health plans and health care clearinghouses known as covered entities as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating receiving maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities entities that are found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance further entities that knowingly obtain use or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a hipaa covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by hipaa may be subject to criminal penalties 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

even when hipaa does not apply according to the federal trade commission ftc violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section 5a of the federal trade commission act the ftc expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities 

in addition certain state and nonus laws such as the eu general data protection regulation gdpr govern the privacy and security of personal data including healthrelated data in certain circumstances some of which are more stringent than hipaa and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect thus complicating compliance efforts failure to comply with these laws where applicable can result in the imposition of significant civil andor criminal penalties and private litigation for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa went into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa among other things creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to california residents including the right to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach in europe the gdpr went into effect in may 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the eea and the united kingdom in addition the gdpr increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the eea to the united states and other jurisdictions that the european commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the eea to the united states by invalidating the euus privacy shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the eea companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company whichever is greater additionally following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eea and the eu and the expiry of the transition period companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom national law the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover the relationship between the united kingdom and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction which exposes us to further compliance risk 

raw materials 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks however if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in the supply of products if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets our products through our own field sales representatives distributors and eye care practitioners including optometrists ophthalmologists opticians and optical chains coopervision also sells to distributors and to mass merchandisers who offer eye care services to support the sale and use of coopervision products coopervision engages in various activities and offers a variety of services these include clinical training digital marketing for the customer ecommerce telemarketing social media and

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the future by the global covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions 

the current global pandemic caused by the spread of the novel strain of coronavirus referred to as “covid19” has negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally and has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption within the markets in which we operate the pandemic has adversely affected and is likely to further adversely affect nearly all aspects of our business and markets including our sales operations cash flow and workforce and the operations of our customers suppliers vendors and business partners among other things many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures in response to the pandemic and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits which has resulted in reduced demand for and sales of our products and services 

if the covid19 pandemic continues and conditions worsen our results of operations cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in numerous ways including but not limited to decreased net sales from sales of our products and services due to customer facility closures restricted access and reduced patient visits exams and elective medical procedures disruption in the manufacture and distribution of our products including increased manufacturing and distribution costs reduced manufacturing capacity and inadequate inventory levels increased risk of inventory that may expire writeoffs or obsolescence of inventory equipment or other assets disruptions to our raw material and product suppliers and broader supply chain and distribution systems delays in our clinical trials which could negatively impact our new product pipeline milestones and regulatory clearances and approvals extended delays in or defaults on payments of outstanding receivables insolvency of customers suppliers vendors and business partners an inability to access lending capital markets and other sources of liquidity when needed on reasonable terms or at all an inability to comply with financial covenants in our debt agreements and future restructuring impairment and other charges 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain difficult to predict and largely outside of our control including but not limited to the continued spread duration and severity of the pandemic outbreak the occurrence spread duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks the impact on our customers and suppliers the actions taken by the us and foreign governments to contain the pandemic address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity the occurrence duration and severity of a global regional or national recession depression or other sustained adverse market event and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2020 and 2019 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues concerns about the euro zone’s sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal 2020 uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners if our customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 

coopervision and coopersurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains due to this trend global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the results of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations with significant business operations in europe including in the uk in june 2016 a majority of voters in the uk elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum brexit in march 2017 the government of the uk formally gave notice of its intent to withdraw from the eu on january 31 2020 the uk ceased to be a member state of the eu eu law applicable to the uk continues to apply to and in the uk for the duration of a transition period which is presently scheduled to expire on december 31 2020 the transition period during the transition period the eu and the uk will negotiate the terms of their future relationship there is no assurance that such negotiations will be successful and it is uncertain what if any laws similar to those of the eu will continue to apply in and to the uk following the expiration of the transition period since a significant proportion of the uk’s regulatory framework is derived from eu directives and regulations eu law ceasing to apply in and to the uk following the expiration of the transition period could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the movement and approval of our products to and from the uk and eu we could face new regulatory costs and challenges a negative impact on the movement of goods and materials in our supply chain and increased tariffs and duties that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations until expiration of the transition period and the future relationship between the eu and the uk is established it is difficult to anticipate brexit’s potential impact 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations coopervision acquired a privatelyheld us contact lens manufacturer focusing on orthok lenses in fiscal 2020 and a privatelyheld scleral lens company in fiscal 2019 coopersurgical acquired a privatelyheld distributor of ivf medical devices and systems in fiscal 2020 and a privatelyheld us medical device company in fiscal 2019 risks we could face with respect to these acquisitions include 

 

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or constrained idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related work stoppages technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely constrained excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions unexpected demand inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability capital investments customer service levels and nearterm financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in costa rica hungary puerto rico the united kingdom and the united states with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in costa rica the united kingdom and the united states with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world in november 2017 coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of belgium the united kingdom and the united states and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in united states and the netherlands any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties challenges related to system implementation destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or those of our third party service providers or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm 

security breaches computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers or partners the size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are increasing in their frequency levels of persistence levels of sophistication and intensity and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in addition to unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal data confidential information intellectual property or other sensitive information such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and ransomware and may use a variety of methods including denialofservice attacks social engineering and other means to attain such unauthorized access or acquisition or otherwise affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality integrity and availability of information like many other companies we experience attempted cybersecurity actions 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

on a frequent basis and the frequency of such attempts could increase in the future while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources including outside groups such as external service providers organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies we cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns data leakages or breaches in our systems or those of our thirdparty services providers or partners any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing new enterprise resource planning erp systems at coopervision and coopersurgical implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

we rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials packaging materials and components mechanical equipment and some finished goods we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products we also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from oem suppliers supply of these goods items and materials is protected by contractual agreements availability of alternative suppliers andor safety stocks however if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods items or materials to us on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products for example among other situations some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by few sole suppliers and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies as well as other third parties 

may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our largest competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon inc and bausch health companies inc may have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision’s strategy or interfere with its customers’ relationships and loyalty for example more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner coopervision’s failure to adapt to the threats posed by these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens health market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality access to local markets based on regulatory clearances price and effective communication of product information to physicians hospitals patients and ivf clinics coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care and diagnostics testing industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopervision both internally and externally with third parties invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses while much of coopervision’s research and development activities are performed internally it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties coopersurgical has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical also has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organic growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects greater dependence on and reduced control over third party deliverables the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted these regulations include for example regulations enacted in the european union such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products our coopersurgical division manufactures these and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in japan china and various states of the us may require us to redesign certain products to ensure compliance with the applicable 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have antitakeover effects 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal state and foreign laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information including health related information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use privacy confidentiality security availability and integrity of individually identifiable information including protected health information phi for example hipaa establishes national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

business associates with whom such entities contract for services including another one of our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed and to adopt administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect phi when we are acting as a business associate our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us  known as business associate agreements  that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates 

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations however our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins viruses hackers and other potential sources of security breaches in addition we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws andor under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business 

even when hipaa does not apply according to the ftc violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of section 5a of the federal trade commission act the ftc expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities 

further california enacted the ccpa on june 28 2018 which went into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation although there are limited exemptions for healthrelated information including clinical trial data the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability some observers have noted that the ccpa could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united states which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level and if passed such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than united states covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu and eea member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations for example the gdpr went into effect on may 25 2018 and imposes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data of individuals within the eea and the united kingdom including for example expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized ie keycoded data mandatory data breach notification requirements handling data subject access requests and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities in addition member states of the eea may impose further obligations relating to the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information in addition the gdpr increases the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the eea to the united states and other jurisdictions that the european commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws in july 2020 the court of justice of the european union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the eea to the united states by invalidating the euus privacy shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the eea 

compliance with us and foreign privacy and security laws rules and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts require us to engage in costly compliance exercises restrict our ability to collect use and disclose data or in some cases impact our or our partners’ or suppliers’ ability to operate in certain jurisdictions each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection authorities fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business for example companies that must comply with the gdpr face increased compliance obligations and risk including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4 of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company whichever is greater additionally following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eea and the eu and the expiry of the transition period companies will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom national law the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover the relationship between the united kingdom and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction which exposes us to further compliance risk such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the aca of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility office and surgical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments will remain in effect until 2030 with the temporary suspension from may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 unless additional action is taken by congress the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments began in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the european economic area eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

mdr was to become applicable in may 2020 but on april 23 2020 to take the pressure off eea national authorities notified bodies manufacturers and other actors so they can focus fully on urgent priorities related to the covid 19 pandemic the european council and parliament adopted regulation 2020561 postponing the date of application of the medical devices regulation by one year to may 2021 the ivdr will become applicable in may 2022 once applicable the new regulations will among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

these modifications may have an impact on the way we conduct our business in the eea and an adverse impact on our overall business operations and financial results 

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback physician selfreferral false claims and physician payment transparency laws and regulations these laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations including our commercial laboratory operations and how we research market sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing 

approval such laws include 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition federal government price reporting laws among other things require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement andor discounts on our marketed drugs participation in these programs and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts 

violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

legislative or regulatory reforms in the united states or the eu may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to manufacture market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained 

from time to time legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices in addition the fda may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis over the last several years the fda has proposed reforms to its 510k clearance process and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510k clearance process for their products 

in addition fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the fda in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products any new statutes regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to obtain clearance or approval for manufacture market or distribute our products we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations statutes legal interpretation or policies when and if promulgated enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future such changes could among other things require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval changes to manufacturing methods recall replacement or discontinuance of our products or additional record keeping 

our medical device products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable domestic or international regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products increase the cost of compliance impose additional 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

regulatory requirements on us or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

modifications and enhancements to medical devices also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the fda’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the united states or abroad 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

we offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new proposals 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldts we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however if there are changes in the fda’s policy or if the fda disagrees that our marketed tests are ldts or that we are marketing our tests outside the scope of the fda’s current policy of enforcement discretion we may become subject to extensive regulatory requirements and may be required to stop selling our existing tests or launching any other tests we may develop and to conduct additional clinical trials or take other actions prior to continuing to market our tests this could significantly increase the costs and expenses of conducting or otherwise harm our business 

legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldt have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldt is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldt our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldt it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldt or new legislation regulations such as the eu ivdr regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our genetic products and to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our genetic tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia uk human fertilization  embryology association hfea regulating ivf a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratories must be certified under clia and iso 15189 in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in japan the united kingdom and united states and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction 

any sanction imposed under clia its implementing regulations or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure or our failure to renew a clia certificate a state license or accreditation could have a material and adverse effect on our diagnostic testing business operating results and financial condition the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms also has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions including revocation of the clia certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of a cliacertified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory if we were to lose our clia certification or required state licensure we would not be able to operate our clinical laboratory 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and conduct our tests in full or in particular states which would adversely impact our diagnostic testing business operating results and financial condition 

pricing pressure from our competitors customers and changes in thirdparty coverage and reimbursement may adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our operating results 

competition in our industry has increased as a result of new market entrants new technologies and as more established companies have intensified competitive pricing pressure as a result of these competitive forces we believe there will continue to be pricing pressure in the future because our coopersurgical products are generally purchased by hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics and billed to various thirdparty payors changes in the purchasing behavior of such customers or the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products including as a result of healthcare reform initiatives could create additional pricing pressure on us in addition to these competitive forces we continue to see pricing pressure as our customers introduce new pricing structures into their contracts and agreements including fixed price formulas capitated pricing and structured pricing intended to contain healthcare costs such trends may adversely affect demand for our products and may drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products both of which would negatively affect our operating results 

disruptions at the fda and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all which could negatively impact our business 

the ability of the fda to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels statutory regulatory and policy changes the fda’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and other events that may otherwise affect the fda’s ability to perform routine functions average review times at the fda have fluctuated in recent years as a result in addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable disruptions at the fda and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved drugs and medical devices to be reviewed andor approved by necessary government agencies which would adversely affect our business for example over the last several years including for 35 days beginning on december 22 2018 the us government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the fda have had to furlough critical fda employees and stop critical activities 

separately in response to the covid19 pandemic on march 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and on march 18 2020 the fda temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subsequently on july 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to resume certain onsite inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a riskbased prioritization system the fda intends to use this riskbased assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities regulatory authorities outside the united states may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the covid19 pandemic if a prolonged government shutdown occurs or if global health concerns continue to prevent the fda or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections reviews or other regulatory activities it could significantly impact the ability of the fda or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to tax 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

determination of the company’s effective tax rate and evaluation of its tax positions is uncertain with rapidly changing enactment interpretation and enforcement of tax regulations by taxing authorities globally when tax matters arise several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax matter may require the use of cash in the year of resolution for instance in fiscal 2019 we were required to pay additional taxes resulting from an inquiry in the united kingdom related to the transfer out of the country of certain intellectual property rights in connection with a 2014 acquisition 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our tax filings by domestic and foreign tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles and changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals in addition government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made

between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change and any such change could be materially and adversely affect our business 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

risks relating to interest and foreign exchange rates debt and equity 

exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we are also exposed to the danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar among other currencies we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis currently we do not enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances and although we may enter into these types of agreement in the future they would not eliminate that risk entirely 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt from time to time we may use interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our variablerate debt as further described in the note 14 of consolidated financial statements we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

the uk’s financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 we have multiple debt facilities which bear interest at a variable rate based on the eurodollar libor rate in effect from time to time a change or transition away from libor as a common reference rate in the global financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding libor we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the expected impact

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit plan costs 

we sponsor a defined benefit plan for certain employees in the united states this defined benefit plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations

covid19 considerations 

the world health organization categorized the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid19 virus and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid19 virus many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits this has had and we believe will continue to have an adverse effect on our sales operating results and cash flows 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we have taken an active role in addressing the ongoing pandemic’s impact on our employees suppliers distribution channels operations and customers including taking precautionary measures such as implementing contingency plans and making operational adjustments as necessary we have taken measures to help ensure the safety of our personnel in all our facilities and we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide 

as of the date of this filing we have not experienced any significant disruption at our manufacturing facilities we have had no significant disruption in our access to necessary raw materials and other supplies or with our distribution network however we have experienced higher unabsorbed fixed overhead costs labor inefficiencies higher cost of production and higher freight charges as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a result we instituted an inventory control project to reduce buildup of excess inventory our manufacturing and distribution operations have responded to the impacts related to the covid19 pandemic and we have been able to continue to supply our products around the world without interruption in the future we may decide or need to implement additional precautionary measures or operational adjustments as we deem prudent to meet consumer demand or to help further ensure employee safety we believe that the actions we are taking have enabled us to keep our employees safe and our supply chain intact and will help us emerge from this global pandemic operationally sound and well positioned for longterm growth 

the extent to which the global covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments at this time future developments are highly uncertain difficult to predict and largely outside of our control these include but are not limited to the spread duration and severity of the pandemic outbreak and any subsequent waves of additional outbreaks actions taken by governments to contain the pandemic address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume we will continue to closely monitor the developments relating to the covid19 pandemic and the responses from governments and private sector participants and their respective impact on our company and on our customers suppliers vendors and business partners

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate etr was 106 and 23 for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively the etr in fiscal 2020 increased in comparison to fiscal 2019 primarily due to foreign earnings subject to us tax partially offset by a shift in the geographic mix of income 

the etr for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 was less than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to foreign earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates a stepup of the us taxdeductible basis of intellectual property rights from intraentity sales and excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation this was partially offset by foreign earnings subject to us tax the jurisdictions with lower tax rates with the most significant tax impact include barbados puerto rico and the united kingdom see note 6 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2020 was 386 and 48 respectively compared to 363 million and 51 million respectively in fiscal 2019 as of october 31 2020 there was 825 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards see note 9 stock plans of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2020 would have increased by approximately 808 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2020 would have increased by approximately 237

we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions therefore about 585 million of our longterm income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above however other longterm liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet include a reserve for a portion of these uncertain tax positions see note 6 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements 

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

the world health organization categorized the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 as a pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused a severe global health crisis along with economic and societal disruptions and uncertainties which have negatively impacted business and healthcare activity globally as a result of healthcare systems responding to the demands of managing the pandemic governments around the world imposing measures designed to reduce the transmission of the covid19 virus and individuals responding to the concerns of contracting the covid19 virus many optical practitioners and retailers hospitals medical offices and fertility clinics closed their facilities restricted access or delayed or canceled patient visits exams and elective medical procedures and many customers that have reopened are experiencing reduced patient visits this has had and we believe will continue to have an adverse effect on our sales operating results and cash flows 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates particularly as it relates to estimates reliant on forecasts and other assumptions impacted by uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our accounting estimates will depend on future developments including but not limited to the continued spread duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic the occurrence spread duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks the actions taken by the us and foreign governments to contain the covid19 pandemic address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity the occurrence duration and severity of a global regional or national recession depression or other sustained adverse market event the impact of the developments described above on our customers and suppliers and how

quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume the accounting matters assessed included but were not limited to 

 

there was not a material impact to the above estimates in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continually monitor and evaluates the estimates used as additional information becomes available adjustments will be made to these provisions periodically to reflect new facts and circumstances that may indicate that historical experience may not be indicative of current andor future results our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the covid19 pandemic as well as other factors could result in material changes to the estimates and material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods 

our critical accounting policies include 

 product discounts including certain rebates sales incentives and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer we evaluate contractual terms historical experience and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized our paragard program is subject to medicaid rebates which are estimated at the time of sale based upon the difference between current retail pricing and contractual medicaid pricing and an estimate of the number of units that will be sold to medicaid patients which is informed by historical trends of claim history 

sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data promotional programs such as cooperative advertising arrangements are recorded in the same period as related sales reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates sales incentives volume discounts contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements we currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact

recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets and stockholders equity 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we use the fullyear income and the related income tax

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns that we have determined are not morelikelythannot realizable our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts these tax reserves have been established based on managements assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions all tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations to the extent reasonable and practical we may decide to reduce the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations most of our operations outside the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally our british pound sterling euro and japanese yen denominated debt and receivables denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and from operations in other foreign currencies although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely at october 31 2020  a uniform hypothetical 5 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would have resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease in approximately 309 million in operating income for the fiscal year ended october 31 2020  for additional information see item 1a risk factors   our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results ” and see note 1 accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rates on our revolving lines of credit and term loans may vary with the federal funds rate and libor we may decrease this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods 

on april 6 2020 we entered into six interest rate swap contracts to hedge variable cash flows associated with libor the interest rate swap contracts became effective on april 6 2020 and have maturities of seven years or less with a total notional amount of 15 billion the outstanding contracts as of october 31 2020 have a total notional amount of 14 billion we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this time 

we did not have any crosscurrency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts as of october 31 2020 

on october 16 2020 we entered into a 364day 3500 million term loan agreement by and among us the lenders party thereto and the bank of nova scotia as administrative agent which matures on october 15 2021 we used the funds to partially repay outstanding borrowings under the 2020 revolving credit facility as defined below at october 31 2020 we had 3500 million outstanding under this agreement the interest rate was 093 at october 31 2020 

on april 1 2020 we entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement the 2020 credit agreement among us coopervision international holding company lp coopersurgical netherlands bv coopervision holding kft the lenders from time to time party thereto and keybank national association as administrative agent the 2020 credit agreement provides for a a multicurrency revolving credit facility the 2020 revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 129 billion and b a term loan facility the 2020 term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 8500 million each of which unless terminated earlier mature on april 1 2025 the 2020 credit agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement to repay an outstanding term loan and for general corporate purposes at october 31 2020 we had 7546 million available under the 2020 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

revolving credit facility and 8500 million outstanding under the 2020 term loan facility the interest rate on the 2020 term loan facility was 115 at october 31 2020 

on september 27 2019 we extended the maturity of the 2018 term loan agreement to september 25 2020 and increased the amount to 5000 million as so amended the 2019 term loan agreement at maturity on september 25 2020 outstanding amounts under the 2019 term loan agreement were fully repaid using borrowings under the 2020 revolving credit facility the interest rate on the 2020 revolving credit facility was 115 at october 31 2020 

see note 5 debt of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 



our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately 102 million based on average debt outstanding after consideration of our interest rate swap contracts for fiscal 2020 for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors  “we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt” and note 1 accounting policies and note 5 debt of the consolidated financial statements for additional information

coopervision and coopersurgical each operate in highly competitive environments both of coopers businesses compete predominantly on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit price service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse lenses and frequently replaced lenses which are designed for twoweek and monthly replacement 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision offers spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding we believe this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 the market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new valueadded products such as spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices and add aspherical optical properties andor higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business silicone hydrogel lenses represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity ® brand is coopervisions leading product line under the biofinity ® brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products 

coopervision markets singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses with a complete line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti ® 1day brand and singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under our myday ® brand we also compete in the traditional hydrogel singleuse product segment with several lenses including our proclear ® 1 day lenses we believe the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that our competitive silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel product offerings represent an opportunity for our business 

we manufacture silicone hydrogel biofinity brand spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses avaira vitality brand spherical and toric lenses and myday brand spherical and toric lenses using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear 

in addition to its silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with other traditional hydrogel products 

coopervision believes that our key accounts which include optical chains global retailers certain buying groups and mass merchandisers are growing faster than the overall market we are focused on supporting the growth of all our customers by investing in selling promotional and advertising activities further we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue providing quality service with our industry leading sku range and customized offerings 

coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions in fiscal 2019 coopervision acquired blanchard contact lenses a privatelyheld scleral lens company which expands coopervisions specialty and scleral lens portfolio in fiscal 2018 coopervision acquired paragon vision services a leading provider of orthok specialty contact lenses and oxygen permeable rigid contact lens material and blueyes ltd blueyes a longstanding distribution partner with a leading position in the distribution of contact lenses to the optical and pharmacy sector in israel

contact lens product sales 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc bausch health companies inc and alcon inc 

coopervisions competitors may have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects including laser vision correction coopervision believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products biofinity monthly spherical toric and multifocal lenses avaira vitality tm twoweek spherical and toric lenses clariti 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses and myday singleuse spherical and toric lenses coopervision believes the clariti 1day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market 

in addition to a broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses coopervision competes with different manufacturing processes which allow it to produce a broad range of spheres toric and multifocal lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low 

coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products and services focused on advancing the health of women babies and families through a diversified portfolio of products and services including medical devices fertility genomics diagnostics and contraception we offer quality products innovative technologies and superior services to clinicians and patients worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with clinicians to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

identify products and new technologies from disposable products to diagnostic tests to sophisticated instruments and equipment to bring new products to market the result is a broad portfolio of products and services that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that health care professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of family and womens health and reproductive issues 

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

coopersurgical competes in the global invitro fertilization ivf market with a product portfolio of ivf media and assisted reproductive technology solutions including genetic testing designed to enhance the work of fertility professionals to the benefit of women babies and families 

we have continued to invest in coopersurgicals business through the acquisition of companies and product lines for new or complementary products and services for the ivf process and within the obgyn space 

in fiscal 2019 coopersurgical acquired incisive surgical inc a privatelyheld us medical device company that develops mechanical surgical solutions for skin closure in fiscal 2018 coopersurgical acquired the assets of paragard which is an intrauterine system ius from teva pharmaceuticals industries limited teva this acquisition broadens and strengthens coopersurgicals womens health product portfolio in office and surgical procedures paragard ® is the only hormonefree long lasting reversible contraceptive option approved by fda available in the united states and iuss represent a large and growing segment of the contraceptive market coopersurgical also acquired in fiscal 2018 the lifeglobal group lifeglobal which was a privately held company that specializes primarily in the ivf media marketplace we intend to continue investing in coopersurgicals business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of family health fertility and diagnostics 

market for womens and family reproductive health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for family health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery hospitals and surgical centers obgyn medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to obgyn offices in the united states to increase over the next decade office visit activity related to menopause abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are expected to increase slightly over the next decade driving the growth is a growing population of women over the age of 65 according to the united states census estimates a large and stable middleaged population and a steady number of reproductive age women with increasing fertility issues as well as women interested in contraception that is reversible such as with the paragard ® ius coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

recent trends in the united states market include the development of more costeffective health care delivery models including moving treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for our medical devices

government regulation 

medical device and pharmaceutical regulation 

most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage record keeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior notice to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation qsr facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a class i or class ii device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of pma applications the fda aims to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires additional information to support substantial equivalence if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device the device sponsor must fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda may require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures or if the device has been previously classified as class iii the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical nonclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

following receipt of a pma application the fda conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review if it is not the agency will refuse to file the pma if it is the fda will accept the application for filing and begin the review the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data nonclinical data or clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicants response to deficiencies communicated by the fda the fda considers a pma or pma supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an fda request for information eg major deficiency letter within 180 days after the fda issues such request also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications amendments to a pma application or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the pma process pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a pma application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials for medical devices 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is rarely required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda some types of studies deemed to present nonsignificant risk are deemed to have an approved ide once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board approval is obtained if the device presents a significant risk to human health as defined by the fda the sponsor must submit an ide application to the fda and obtain ide approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials the ide application which includes a clinical study protocol must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks t o human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation of medical devices 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations which require changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections for cause by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements which are subject to new legislation and change can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

our genetic testing laboratory services are not currently regulated by the fda or foreign ministries of health although the fda has statutory authority to regulate in vitro diagnostic products ivds used for clinical purposes as medical devices and to assure that such products are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldt which are a subset of ivds that are intended for clinical use and designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory we believe our genetic laboratory tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however the ivdr will regulate the testing of human embryos which will be classified as class c in addition even though we commercialize our tests as ldt our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda 

pharmaceutical regulation 

our paragard intrauterine copper contraceptive is regulated by the fda as a drug 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications nda withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold untitled letters warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 

any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including manufacturing periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising promotion drug shortage reporting compliance with any postapproval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as phase 4 clinical trials a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and surveillance recordkeeping and reporting requirements including adverse experiences 

after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to further testing to new clinical investigation requirements and prior fda review and approval there also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices or cgmps and other requirements which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our thirdparty manufacturers 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented or fda notification fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmps specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any thirdparty manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations imposition of postmarket studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program among other consequences 

the fda closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda physicians in their independent professional medical judgement may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda we however are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling 

in addition the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products including samples is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution the drug supply chain security act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and serialization 

failure to comply with any of the fda’s requirements which are subject to new legislation and change could result in significant adverse enforcement actions these include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as refusal to approve pending applications license suspension or revocation withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials warning letters untitled letters cyber letters modification of promotional materials or labeling product recalls product seizures or detentions refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution debarment injunctions fines consent decrees corporate integrity agreements refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment it is also possible that failure to comply with the fda’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws as well as state consumer protection laws any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity among other adverse consequences 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies in other countries must approve new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements coopervision maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products and coopersurgical maintains iso 13485 certification for medical devices and iso 15189 certification for the genomics laboratories a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

in may 2017 the mdr regulation 2017745 was adopted the mdr will however only become applicable three years after publication in may 2020 once applicable the new regulations will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability and additional post market surveillance and vigilance compliance with the mdr will require recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards further products sold as ivds in europe will be regulated under the in vitro diagnostics directive 9879ec a new regulation the ivdr eu 2017746 the ivdr has been released and will become fully enforceable in 2022 these regulations include requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and qualitysystem requirements 

both coopervision and coopersurgical have been actively deploying regulatory and compliance initiatives designed to allow the continued ability to sell and market their respective products in the eu under the mdr and the ivdr

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws physician payment transparency laws and laws pertaining to health information privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

in addition the federal government as part of the affordable care act the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could result in sanctions such as fines injunctions and civil penalties 

the impact to our businesses of the aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain the aca imposes a 23 percent excise tax with limited exceptions on any entity that manufactures or imports class i ii and iii medical devices offered for sale in the united states that began on january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense on our statement of income the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 imposed a twoyear moratorium of the device excise tax for device sales in calendar years 2016 and 2017 on january 22 2018 the moratorium was extended for two more years absent further legislative action the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting january 1 2020 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the aca or the impact of any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations for example the trump administration recently narrowed the aca mandate for employers and insurers to cover birth control pills and other contraceptives by expanding the types of entities that could invoke religious or moral beliefs to avoid the aca requirement the trump administration and the us congress may take further action regarding the aca including but not limited to repeal or replacement additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge

raw materials 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks however if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in the supply of products if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets our products through our own field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision also sells to distributors and to mass merchandisers who offer eye care services to support the sale and use of coopervision products coopervision engages in various activities and offers a variety of services these include clinical training digital marketing for the customer ecommerce telemarketing social media and journal advertisements coopervision also invested in tools that allow our customers to offer their patients monthly purchase and delivery subscriptions in certain smaller countries coopervision often uses distributors and leverages our distributors sales and marketing resources to attract major customers to coopervision 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors coopersurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry trade shows professional educational programs and internet promotions including ecommerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals with the addition of paragard coopersurgical expanded its awareness campaigns to include direct to consumer elements including print internetsocial media radio and television 

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to our overall business the names of certain coopers products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect our intellectual property rights aggressively 

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses we own certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

dependence on customers 

no customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018 one customer a coopervision contact lens distributor accounted for approximately 10 of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2017 see note 12 business segment information of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

government contracts 

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

backlog 

backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers business units 

seasonality 

coopervision and coopersurgical net sales in the fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners offices fertility clinics and hospitalssurgical centers for surgical procedures is relatively light during the holiday season 

compliance with environmental laws 

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

in addition the company continues to monitor and comply with environmental health and safety regulations in countries in which it operates throughout the world in particular european union and china restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs and registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach 

employees 

as of october 31 2019  we had approximately 12000 employees we believe we have good relations with our employees

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our largest competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc and alcon inc may have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision’s strategy or interfere with its customers’ relationships and loyalty for example more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner coopervision’s failure to adapt to the threats posed by these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens health care market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality access to local markets based on regulatory clearances price and effective communication of product information to physicians hospitals patients and ivf clinics coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations coopervision acquired blanchard contact lenses in fiscal 2019 paragon vision sciences and blueyes in fiscal 2018 coopersurgical acquired incisive surgical inc in fiscal 2019 paragard and lifeglobal in fiscal 2018 risks we could face with respect to these acquisitions include 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others over the past few years coopersurgical has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

organic growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy coopervision both internally and externally with third parties invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses while much of coopervision’s research and development activities are performed internally it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects greater dependence on and reduced control over third party deliverables the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care and diagnostics testing industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2019 and 2018 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues concerns about the euro zone’s 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal 2019 uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners if our customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 

coopervision and coopersurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains due to this trend global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations with significant business operations in europe including in the united kingdom in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum in march 2017 the government of the united kingdom formally gave notice of its intent to withdraw from the european union serving this notice began a twoyear period for the united kingdom to negotiate terms for its withdrawal from the european union the european union and the united kingdom have agreed to delay the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union multiple times currently january 31 2020 is the deadline to reach an agreement regarding the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union and their relationship following such a withdrawal if an agreement is not reached or the deadline not postponed prior to january 31 2020 the united kingdom may withdraw from the european union without an agreement in place there is significant uncertainty regarding the terms of any agreement between the united kingdom and the european union and the potential for a “nodeal” withdrawal 

these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have and how such withdrawal could affect or whether it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 we have multiple debt facilities which bear interest at a variable rate based on the eurodollar libor rate in effect from time to time a change or transition away from libor as a common reference rate in the global financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding libor we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the expected impact 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we are also exposed to the danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar among other currencies we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or constrained idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely constrained excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions unexpected demand inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability capital investments customer service levels and near term financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico hungary costa rica belgium and the united states with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in the united states costa rica the netherlands and the united kingdom with other smaller locations also existing in multiple locations around the world in november 2017 coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of the united states the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in united states and the netherlands any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties challenges related to system implementation destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable domestic or international regulatory requirements or to respond to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

we rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials packaging materials and components mechanical equipment and some finished goods we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products we also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from oem suppliers supply of these goods items and materials is protected by contractual agreements availability of alternative suppliers andor safety stocks however if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods items or materials to us on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products for example among other situations some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by a sole supplier and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies as well as other third parties 

may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted these regulations include for example regulations enacted in the european union such as the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances or reach which requires the registration of and regulates use of certain chemicals the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive or rohs which regulates the use of certain hazardous substances in certain products our coopersurgical division manufactures these and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in japan china and various states of the us may require us to redesign certain products to ensure compliance with the applicable

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

determination of the company’s effective tax rate and evaluation of its tax positions is uncertain with rapidly changing enactment interpretation and enforcement of tax regulations by taxing authorities globally when tax matters arise several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax matter may require the use of cash in the year of resolution our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we recently faced an inquiry by the united kingdom tax authorities regarding the application of the united kingdom diverted profits tax dpt related to the transfer out of the united kingdom of certain intellectual property rights in connection with the 2014 acquisition of sauflon pharmaceutical ltd which we resolved in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles and changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the 2017 act on december 22 2017 as a result of which we recognized in fiscal 2018 a provisional amount of 2146 million as reasonable estimate of the impact of the provisions of the 2017 act as of october 31 2019 we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act and did not recognize any material adjustments to the provisional tax expense previously recorded however certain provisions of the 2017 act and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations 

in addition government agencies in nonus jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in lowtax jurisdictions or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates the oecd has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting as a result the tax laws in the us and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change and any such change could be materially and adversely affect our business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements 

or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs 

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing new enterprise resource planning erp systems at coopervision and coopersurgical implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm 

the size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have antitakeover effects 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products increase the cost of compliance impose additional regulatory requirements on us or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

modifications and enhancements to medical devices and drug products also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the fda’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the united states such as new policies introduced by the trump administration or abroad 

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

we offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldt we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldt have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldt is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldt our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldt it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldt or new legislation regulations such as ivdr or guidance may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our products and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia uk human fertilization  embryology association hfea regulating ivf a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratories must be certified under clia and iso 15189 in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in the united states and internationally in canada and the united kingdom and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the aca of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility office and surgical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the european economic area eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

mdr will become applicable in 2020 and ivdr will become applicable in 2022 once applicable the new regulations will among other things

 these modifications may have an impact on the way we conduct our business in the eea and an adverse impact on our overall business operations and financial results 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

state and federal laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa govern the collection dissemination use privacy confidentiality security availability and integrity of individually identifiable information including protected health information phi hipaa establishes basic national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services including another one of our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed and to adopt administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect phi when we are acting as a business associate our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us  known as business associate agreements  that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates 

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations however our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins viruses hackers and other potential sources of security breaches in addition we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws andor under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than united states covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations for example the eu data protection directive as implemented into national laws by the eu member states imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the processing of personal data the new euwide general data protection regulation gdpr became applicable on may 25 2018 replacing the current data protection laws of each eu member state the gdpr implemented more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized ie keycoded data mandatory data breach notification requirements handling data subject access requests and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection authorities fines and penalties for example of up to 200 million euros or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher under the gdpr and eprivacy regulation litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to health care practitioners that sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to health care practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the aca among other things amended the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the aca also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute in addition federal government price reporting laws changed by the aca to among other things increase the minimum medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and offer such rebates to additional populations that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement andor discounts on our marketed drugs participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

discounts on our products increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

transition from libor 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced in july 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 we have undertaken an assessment of contracts that will be impacted by the transition away from libor to date we have identified that substantially all of our term loan and credit facility agreements include an adjusted libor option we are continuing to evaluate the scope of impacted contracts and the potential impact we are also monitoring the developments regarding alternative rates and may amend certain contracts to accommodate those rates if the contract does not already specify a replacement rate while the notional value of agreements potentially indexed to libor is material we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the expected impact 

we believe that current cash cash equivalents and future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs including working capital needs capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements included in this annual report to the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs such as that for acquisitions share repurchases cash dividends or other activities as we execute our business strategy we anticipate that additional funds will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds however such financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all

operating income 



coopervision operating income remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales but increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to improved sales of higher margin products including biofinity partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates 

coopersurgical operating income increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to an increase in sales of higher margin products gain of 190 million on sale of an intangible asset as discussed above and recent acquisitions coopersurgical operating income in fiscal 2018 included 493 million of paragard and lifeglobal acquisitions inventory stepup charges and an intangible asset impairment charge of 244 million 

the decrease of corporate operating loss in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher compensation costs related to executives retirements which impacted the prior year 

on a consolidated basis operating income increased due to the factors above 

interest expense 



interest expense remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales and decreased in absolute dollar primarily due to lower average debt balances partially offset by higher interest rates compared to prior year period fiscal 2019 interest expense included 08 million of write off of debt issuance costs on early repayment of the 2018 term loan fiscal 2018 interest expense included 25 million write off of debt issuance costs related to partial prepayments of the 2016 term loan and 17 million of bridge loan facility fees that were incurred related to the paragard acquisition

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate etr was 23 579 and 53 for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the etr in fiscal 2019 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the 2017 act which was recorded in fiscal 2018 tax benefits from audit settlements in fiscal 2019 and additional taxes in the united states from the inclusion of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the gilti provisions that became effective in fiscal 2019 the etr in fiscal 2018 increased in comparison to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the 2017 act which was partially offset by a shift in the geographic mix of income 

the etr for 2019 was less than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a majority of our taxable income being earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates discrete tax benefits from settling income tax audits excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation and additional taxes in the united states from the inclusion of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the gilti provisions the etr for 2018 was greater than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax expense related to the enactment of the 2017 act the etr for 2017 was less than the us federal statutory tax rate because a majority of our taxable income was earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income significantly impacted our overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in some of the foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the us federal statutory tax rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see note 5 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asc 740 income taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment however in december 2017 the sec provided regulatory guidance for accounting of the 2017 act referred to as staff accounting bulletin sab 118 under the guidance in sab 118 we recognized in fiscal 2018 a provisional amount of 2146 million as a reasonable estimate of the impact of the provisions of the 2017 act as of january 31 2019 we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 act and did not recognize any material adjustments to the provisional tax expense previously recorded 

  

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2019 was 363 million and 51 million respectively compared to 432 million and 88 million respectively in fiscal 2018 as of october 31 2019 there was 865 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards see note 8 stock plans of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2019 would have increased by approximately 762 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publicly

the decrease in working capital at october 31 2019 from the end of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

 product discounts including certain rebates sales incentives and volume discounts are granted based on terms of the arrangement with direct distribution customers and at times the indirect end consumer we evaluate contractual terms historical experience and perform internal analysis to estimate total product discounts at the time revenue is recognized our paragard program is subject to medicaid rebates which are estimated at the time of sale based upon the difference between current retail pricing and contractual medicaid pricing and an estimate of the number of units that will be sold to medicaid patients which is informed by historical trends of claim history 

sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales return data promotional programs such as cooperative advertising arrangements are recorded in the same period as related sales reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates sales incentives volume discounts contractual pricing allowances and product returns are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements we currently disclose the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

as of april 30 2019 our reporting units are coopervision officesurgical and fertility reflecting the current way we manage our business 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist we account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards we performed our annual impairment assessment in our third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018  and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill in our reporting units 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets and stockholders equity 

we test goodwill impairment in accordance with asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  we perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we use the fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

we file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts we record a liability for the portion of unrecognized tax benefits claimed that we have determined are not morelikelythannot realizable these tax reserves have been established based on managements assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions all tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse lenses and frequently replaced lenses which are designed for twoweek and monthly replacement 

coopervision offers spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding we believe this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 significantly the market for spherical lenses is growing with the addition of new valueadded products such as spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices and add aspherical optical properties andor higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business silicone hydrogel lenses represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity ®  brand is coopervisions leading product line under the biofinity ®  brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products 

coopervision markets singleuse silicone hydrogel with a complete line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti ®  1day brand and singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under our myday ® brand we also compete in the traditional hydrogel singleuse product segment with several lenses including our proclear ®  1 day lenses we believe the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that our competitive silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel product offerings represent an opportunity for our business 

we manufacture silicone hydrogel biofinity brand spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses avaira vitality brand spherical and toric lenses and myday brand spherical and toric lenses using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear 

in addition to its silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with other traditional hydrogel products 

coopervision believes that our key accounts which include optical chains global retailers certain buying groups and mass merchandisers are growing faster than the overall market and are expected to have a sustainable longterm growth trend we are focused on supporting the growth of all our customers by 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

investing in selling promotional and advertising activities further we are increasing investment in our distribution and packaging capabilities to support the growth of our business and to continue to provide quality service with our industry leading sku range and customized offerings 

coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions in fiscal 2018 coopervision acquired paragon vision services a leading provider of orthok specialty contact lenses and oxygen permeable rigid contact lens material and blueyes ltd blueyes a longstanding distribution partner with a leading position in the distribution of contact lenses to the optical and pharmacy sector in israel in fiscal 2017 we acquired procornea holding bv procornea a netherlands based manufacturer of specialty contact lenses which expands coopervision’s access to myopia nearsightedness management markets with new products and grand vista llc a distributor in russia of soft contact lenses 

contact lens product sales 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc bausch health companies inc and alcon formerly ciba vision corporation owned by novartis ag 

coopervisions competitors may have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects including laser vision correction coopervision believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products biofinity monthly spherical toric and multifocal lenses avaira vitality tm  twoweek spherical and toric 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

lenses clariti 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses and myday singleuse spherical and toric lenses the clariti 1day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide coopervision with the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market 

in addition to a broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses coopervision competes based on the fact that its three manufacturing processes allow coopervision to produce a broad range of spheres toric and multifocal lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low 

coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products and services focused on advancing the health of women babies and families through a diversified portfolio of products and services including medical devices fertility genomics diagnostics and contraception the company offers quality products innovative technologies and superior services to clinicians and patients worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with clinicians to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to diagnostic tests to sophisticated instruments and equipment to bring new products to market the result is a broad portfolio of products and services that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that health care professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of family and womens health and reproductive issues 

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

coopersurgical competes in the global invitro fertilization ivf market with a product portfolio of ivf media and assisted reproductive technology solutions including genetic testing designed to enhance the work of fertility professionals to the benefit of women babies and families 

we have continued to invest in coopersurgicals business through the acquisition of companies and product lines for new or complementary products and services for the ivf process and within the obgyn space 

in fiscal 2018 we acquired the assets of the paragard intrauterine device iud business paragard from teva pharmaceuticals industries limited teva this acquisition broadens and strengthens coopersurgicals current womens health product portfolio in office and surgical procedures paragard ®  is the only hormonefree long lasting reversible contraceptive option approved by fda available in the united states and iuds represent a large and growing segment of the contraceptive market we also acquired in fiscal 2018 the lifeglobal group lifeglobal which was a privately held company that specializes primarily in the ivf media marketplace in fiscal 2017 we acquired wallace the ivf segment of smiths medical international ltd we intend to continue investing in coopersurgicals business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of family health fertility and diagnostics 

market for womens and family reproductive health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for family health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery hospitals and surgical centers obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to obgyns in the united states to increase over the next decade office visit activity related to menopause abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are expected to increase slightly over the next decade driving the growth is a growing population of women over the age of 65 according to the united states census estimates a large and stable middleaged population and a steady number of reproductive age women with increasing fertility issues as well as women interested in contraception that is reversible such as with the paragard ®  iud coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

recent trends in the united states market include the development of more costeffective health care delivery models including moving treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for our medical devices

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the family and womens health care market supplying diagnostic products services and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians fertility clinics and hospitals coopersurgical competes based on our sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of our products coopersurgicals strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands its product line we also offer educational programs for medical professionals in the appropriate use of our products 

coopersurgical is seeking to expand our presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnson boston scientific hologic olympus and medtronic these competitors have wellestablished positions within the operating room environment coopersurgical intends to leverage our relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate our expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

coopersurgical also competes in the fertility category of the womens health care market we have broad product offerings for fertility evaluations and ivf procedures by obgyns reproductive endocrinologists and embryologists these include products for use by the obgyns in their offices for initial evaluations with officebased hysteroscopy and first line treatments such as intrauterine insemination in fertility

government regulation 

medical device and pharmaceutical regulation 

most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage record keeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior notice to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a class i or class ii device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of pma applications the fda aims to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence in reviewing a premarket notification the fda may request additional information including clinical data which may significantly prolong the review process if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device the device is automatically designated as a class iii device the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo  process 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures or if the device has been previously classified as class iii the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

following receipt of a pma application the fda conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review if it is not the agency will refuse to file the pma if it is the fda will accept the application for filing and begin the review the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicants response to deficiencies communicated by the fda the fda considers a pma or pma supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an fda request for information eg major deficiency letter within 180 days after the fda issues such request also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the pma process pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a pma application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials for medical devices 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda some types of studies deemed to present nonsignificant risk are deemed to have an approved ide once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board approval is obtained if the device presents a significant risk to human health as defined by the fda the sponsor must submit an ide application to the fda and obtain ide approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks t o human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation of medical devices 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations which require changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements which are subject to new legislation and change can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

our genetic testing laboratory services are not currently regulated by the fda or foreign ministries of health although the fda has statutory authority to regulate in vitro diagnostic products ivds used for clinical purposes as medical devices and to assure that such products are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldts which are a subset of ivds that are intended for clinical use and designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory we believe our genetic laboratory tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions even though we commercialize our tests as ldts our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda 

pharmaceutical regulation 

our paragard intrauterine copper contraceptive is regulated by the fda as a drug 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications nda withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold issuance of warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 

any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including manufacturing periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising promotion drug shortage reporting compliance with any postapproval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as phase 4 clinical trials a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and surveillance recordkeeping and reporting requirements including adverse experiences 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to further testing to new clinical investigation requirements and prior fda review and approval there also are continuing annual program fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices or cgmps and other requirements which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our thirdparty manufacturers 

changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented or fda notification fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmps specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any thirdparty manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations imposition of postmarket studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program among other consequences 

the fda closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda physicians in their independent professional medical judgement may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda we however are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling 

in addition the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products including samples is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution the drug supply chain security act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and serialization 

failure to comply with any of the fda’s requirements which are subject to new legislation and change could result in significant adverse enforcement actions these include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as refusal to approve pending applications license suspension or revocation withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials warning letters untitled letters cyber letters modification of promotional materials or labeling product recalls product seizures or detentions refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution debarment injunctions fines consent decrees corporate integrity agreements refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment it is also possible that failure to comply with the fda’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws as well as state consumer protection laws any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity among other adverse consequences

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies in other countries must approve new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements cooper also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws physician payment transparency laws and laws pertaining to health information privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

in addition the federal government as part of the affordable care act the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could result in sanctions such as fines injunctions and civil penalties 

the impact to our businesses of the aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain the aca imposes a 23 percent excise tax with limited exceptions on any entity that manufactures or imports class i ii and iii medical devices offered for sale in the united states that began on january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense on our statement of income the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 imposed a two year moratorium of the device excise tax for device sales in calendar years 2016 and 2017 on january 22 2018 the moratorium was extended for two more years absent further legislative action the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting january 1 2020 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the aca or the impact of any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations for example the trump administration recently narrowed the aca mandate for employers and insurers to cover birth control pills and other contraceptives by expanding the types of entities that could invoke religious or moral beliefs to avoid the aca requirement the trump administration and the us congress may take further action regarding the aca including but not limited to repeal or replacement additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge

raw materials 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks however if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in the supply of products if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets our products through our own field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision also sells to distributors and to mass merchandisers who offer eye care services to support the sale and use of coopervision products coopervision engages in various activities and offers a variety of services these include clinical training digital marketing for the customer ecommerce telemarketing social media and journal advertisements coopervision also invested in tools that allow our customers to offer their patients monthly purchase and delivery subscriptions in certain smaller countries coopervision often uses distributors and leverages our distributors sales and marketing resources to attract major customers to coopervision 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors coopersurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry trade shows professional educational programs and internet promotions including ecommerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to our overall business the names of certain coopers products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect our intellectual property rights aggressively 

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses we own certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

dependence on customers 

no customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2018 one customer a coopervision contact lens distributor accounted for approximately 10 and 11  of our consolidated net revenue in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively see note 12 business segment information of the consolidated financial statements for additional information

government contracts 

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

backlog 

backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers business units 

seasonality 

coopervision and coopersurgical net sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners offices fertility clinics and hospitalssurgical centers for surgical procedures is relatively light during the holiday season 

compliance with environmental laws 

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our largest competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc and alcon owned by novartis ag may have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision’s strategy or interfere with its customers’ relationships and loyalty for example more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner coopervision’s failure to adapt to the threats posed by 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens health care market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians hospitals patients and ivf clinics coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations coopervision acquired paragon vision sciences and blueyes in fiscal 2018 procornea and grand vista llc in fiscal 2017 coopersurgical acquired paragard and lifeglobal in fiscal 2018 wallace in fiscal 2017 these acquisitions added operations to coopervision and coopersurgical respectively and expanded their international businesses the acquisitions have correspondingly added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others over the past few years coopersurgical has invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy coopervision both internally and externally with third parties invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses while much of coopervision’s research and development activities are performed internally it also uses external research and development investment in collaborations and joint development with third parties research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects greater dependence on and reduced control over third party deliverables the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care and diagnostics testing industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2018 and 2017 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues concerns about the euro zone’s sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal 2018 uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners if our customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 

coopervision and coopersurgical are encountering consolidation in their customer bases and emergence of more centralized large customer groups and retail chains due to this trend global and regional key account customers now represent a larger proportion or concentration of our business and any disruption to these relationships may have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations with significant business operations in europe including in the united kingdom in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum in march 2017 the government of the united kingdom formally gave notice of its intent to withdraw from 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the european union serving this notice began a twoyear period for the united kingdom to negotiate terms for its withdrawal from the european union at this time it is not certain what steps may be taken to facilitate the united kingdom’s exit from the european union which has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union 

this development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will have and how such withdrawal could affect or whether it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we are also exposed to the danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar among other currencies we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely 

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability and near term financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico hungary costa rica and the united states coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in connecticut texas new york denmark costa rica and united kingdom in november 2017 coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision distributes products out of the united states the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in connecticut denmark and the netherlands coopersurgical is currently shifting its primary distribution facility from denmark to venlo netherlands any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties challenges related to system implementation destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

we rely on independent suppliers in our supply chain for raw materials packaging materials and components mechanical equipment and some finished goods we could experience inventory shortages if any of these suppliers encounter a manufacturing or distribution disruption 

our businesses utilize various chemicals packaging materials components parts and raw materials which are generally available from more than one source however in certain instances we acquire components and materials from sole or primary suppliers to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens certain medical devices and ivf products we also source mechanical equipment and in certain instances finished goods from oem suppliers supply of these goods items and materials is protected by contractual agreements availability of alternative suppliers andor safety stocks however if current suppliers fail to supply sufficient goods items or materials to us on a timely basis or at all for any reason we could experience inventory shortages and disruption in our supply of products for example among other situations some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by a sole supplier and the failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of our silicone hydrogel contact lenses could in turn disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies as well as other third parties 

may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision its competitors and other third parties hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

determination of the company’s effective tax rate and evaluation of its tax positions is uncertain with rapidly changing enactment interpretation and enforcement of tax regulations by taxing authorities globally when tax matters arise several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate which would have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results any resolution of a tax matter may require the use of cash in the year of resolution our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the united kingdom enacted a new diverted profits tax dpt as of april 1 2015 on profits of multinationals that they deemed artificially diverted from the united kingdom the tax rate is 25 dpt is intended to apply in two situations a where a foreign company has artificially avoided having a taxable presence in the united kingdom and b where a group adopts a structure which lacks economic substance in order to divert profits from the united kingdom 

the united kingdom tax authorities uk tax authorities have begun an inquiry regarding the application of dpt to us for fiscal year 2015 we believe that the transactions in question were at arm’s length with no intention to divert profit from the united kingdom and therefore are outside the intended reach of the dpt 

on december 20 2017 the uk tax authorities issued a dpt charging notice of approximately gbp 31 million with respect to the transfer out of the united kingdom of certain intellectual property rights in 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

connection with the 2014 acquisition of sauflon pharmaceutical ltd although the taxes were paid on the transfer the uk tax authorities are challenging the value assigned to such property we have contested the charging notice the process for resolving such a notice can be lengthy and could involve litigation the dpt legislation provides a oneyear review period however it requires prepayment of the charging notice to be made within 30 days of its issuance as required the payment of gbp 310 million was made on january 19 2018 

the company believes final resolution of the transfer value of intellectual property with the uk tax authorities is imminent the outcome of final resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in nondeductible expenses changes in excess tax benefits of stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions 

we are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 

our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles and changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals for example the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act 2017 act significantly changed income tax laws that affect us corporations we made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of this new law and in our calculations of the provisional amounts reflected in our financial statements consistent with sec guidance the company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the 2017 act and recorded provisional income tax expense of 2146 million  in the financial statements for fiscal 2018 the us treasury department the internal revenue service irs and other standardsetting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the 2017 act will be applied or otherwise administered and additional accounting guidance or interpretations may be issued in the future that is different from our current interpretation as we further analyze the new law and collect relevant information to complete our computations of the related accounting impact we may adjust the provisional amounts that could materially affect our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made in addition other countries are considering fundamental tax law changes any changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could also impact our tax liabilities 

we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in nonincome based taxes resulting from changes in federal state or international tax laws changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions results of tax examinations settlements or judicial decisions changes in accounting principles changes to the business operations including acquisitions as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to incur excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system at coopervision implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication a successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business force us to incur excessive costs or cause reputational harm 

the size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties such attacks are of everincreasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to us we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit develop and retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have antitakeover effects 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of medical device and pharmaceutical design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices and drug products may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products increase the cost of compliance impose additional regulatory requirements on us or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

modifications and enhancements to medical devices and drug products also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the fda’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates for example in december 2016 the 21st century cures act cures act was signed into law the cures act among other things is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and medical devices and spur innovation but its ultimate implementation is unclear if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the united states such as new policies introduced by the trump administration or abroad 

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

we offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldt we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldts have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldts is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldts our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

significant changes to the regulation of ldts it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldts or new legislation regulations or guidance may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our products and to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratory must be certified under clia in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in the united states and internationally in canada and the united kingdom and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the aca of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our fertility office and surgical products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

challenges and amendments to the aca in the future additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

national laws of the european economic area eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

the medical devices regulation will however only become applicable in 2020 and the invitro diagnostic medical devices regulation will become applicable in 2022 once applicable the new regulations will among other things 

 

 

 

 

 these modifications may have an impact on the way we conduct our business in the eea and an adverse impact on our overall business operations and financial results 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

state and federal laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa govern the collection dissemination use privacy confidentiality security availability and integrity of individually identifiable information including protected health information phi hipaa establishes basic national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services including another one of our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed and to adopt administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect phi when we are acting as a business associate our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us  known as business associate agreements  that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations however our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins viruses hackers and other potential sources of security breaches in addition we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws andor under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than united states covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations for example the eu data protection directive as implemented into national laws by the eu member states imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the processing of personal data the new euwide general data protection regulation gdpr entered into force in may 2016 and became applicable on may 25 2018 replacing the current data protection laws of each eu member state the gdpr implemented more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection authorities fines and penalties for example of up to 20000000 euros or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher under the gdpr and eprivacy regulation litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to health care practitioners that sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to health care practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the aca among other things amended the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the aca also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute in addition federal government price reporting laws changed by the aca to among other things increase the minimum medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and offer such rebates to additional populations that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement andor discounts on our marketed drugs participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries

coopersurgical’s decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a change in product mix arising from sales of acquired lower margin fertility products and services cost of sales included 58 million of integration costs compared to 44 million in fiscal 2016 

selling general and administrative expense sga 



coopervisions sequential increase in sga in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016 was due to investments to support our longterm objectives including increased headcount investments in information technology and higher distribution expenses to support revenue growth coopervisions sga in fiscal 2018 included 87 million of integration and thirdparty consulting costs 

coopervisions sga in fiscal 2017 included 91 million of legal costs related to unilateral pricing policy upp and 47 million of acquisition and integration costs compared to 29 million of upp costs and 90 million of restructuring and integration costs in fiscal 2016 

the increases in coopersurgicals sga in the fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the addition of paragard marketing expenses and sales headcount investment to support growth coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2018 included approximately 100 million of carrier screening and nipt exit costs and 240 million primarily related to acquisition and integration expenses of acquired companies 

the increase in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars was primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of acquired companies and investment in headcount to support growth coopersurgicals sga included 163 million primarily related to acquisition and integration expenses of acquired companies compared to 113 million in fiscal 2016

amortization of intangibles 



the increases in amortization expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions in coopervision and coopersurgical primarily paragard which increased amortization expense by 708 million  

impairment of intangible assets 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 coopersurgical recognized an impairment charge of 244 million on the intangible assets acquired from recombine inc as the cash flows expected to be generated by this asset group over its estimated remaining life were not sufficient to recover its carrying value coopersurgical acquired recombine inc a clinical genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening in fiscal 2016 in connection with the impairment charge on june 1 2018 coopersurgical announced the exit of the carrier screening and nipt product lines in fertility exit and restructuring charges which were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of compensation and benefits to terminated employees were approximately 100 million the net loss from both product lines are not material to the companys consolidated results of operations 

operating income 



the decrease in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the increase in amortization expense from the paragard intangible assets impairment of intangible asset and investments in sga in both businesses partially offset by the increase in consolidated gross margin 

the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in consolidated gross margins and lower restructuring and integration costs in coopervision compared to fiscal 2016 this was partially offset by a decrease in coopersurgical operating income due to higher operating expenses relating to acquisitions and investments to support growth

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

interest expense 



the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales reflects higher average debt balances mainly due to the 1425 billion term loan entered into on november 1 2017 to primarily fund the paragard acquisition and higher interest rates fiscal 2018 interest expense also included 25 million write off of debt issuance costs related to partial prepayments of the 2016 term loan and 17 million of bridge loan facility fees that were incurred related to the paragard acquisition 

the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales reflect higher average debt balances as a result of debt incurred in connection with acquisitions as well as higher interest rates fiscal 2017 interest expense also included 22 million of bridge loan facility fees that were incurred related to the paragard acquisition 

other income expense net 



foreign exchange loss primarily resulted from the revaluation and settlement of foreign currenciesdenominated balances other income in fiscal 2018 is primarily from the realization of a puerto rico research and development credit of 142 million as we had the intent and ability to sell the credit 

other expense in fiscal 2017 includes a 02 million foreign exchange loss on forward contracts related to an acquisition other expense in fiscal 2016 includes a 06 million foreign exchange loss on forward contracts related to an acquisition and a 04 million loss related to extinguishment of debt 

provision for income taxes 

the company’s effective tax rate etr was 579 53 and 70 for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the etr in fiscal 2018 increased in comparison to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the 2017 act which was partially offset by a shift in the geographic mix of income the etr in fiscal 2017 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2016 due to the shift in the geographic mix of income as well as excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

the etr for 2018 was greater than the us federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax expense related to the enactment of the 2017 act the etr for 2017 and 2016 was less than the us federal statutory tax rate because a majority of our taxable income was earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income significantly impacted our overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the us federal statutory tax rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see note 5 income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for additional information

asc 740 income taxes  requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment however in december 2017 the sec provided regulatory guidance for accounting referred to as staff accounting bulletin sab 118 under the guidance in sab 118 the income tax effects for which the accounting under asc 740 is incomplete are reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate the reasonable estimate is subject to adjustment during a measurement period not to exceed one year until the accounting is complete the estimate is also subject to the finalization of management’s analysis related to certain matters such as developing interpretations of the provision changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns the company recorded a provisional charge for fiscal 2018 utilizing the most recent information and guidance available related to the calculation of the tax liability and the impact to its deferred tax assets and liabilities including those recorded for foreign local and withholding taxes that the company assessed as of october 31 2018 the provisional charge may require further adjustments and changes as new guidance is made available revisions to the provisional charge may be material to the companys financial results and will be recorded in the quarter in which we complete the analysis 

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 was 432 million and 88 million respectively compared to 372 million and 114 million respectively in fiscal 2017 as of october 31 2018 there was 792 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards see note 8 stock plans of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2018 would have increased by approximately 569 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2018 would have increased by approximately 191

2018 highlights 

 comparative statistics 



working capital 

the decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2018 from the end of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in accrued and other current liabilities 1224 million mainly due to an increase in charge backs an increase in short term notes payable 137 million an increase in accounts payable 43 million and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents 111 million this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 581 million from increased revenue an increase in prepayments and other current assets 760 million primarily from the 420 million gbp 31 million payment to uk tax authorities relating to dpt and an increase in inventories 147 million 

at october 31 2018 our inventory months on hand were 63 compared to 65 at october 31 2017 the 147 million increase in inventories was primarily due to increase in finished goods and raw materials to support product launches and production levels our days sales outstanding dso remained flat at 53 days at october 31 2018 and at october 31 2017 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states and have determined there is sufficient cash to fund working capital without repatriating cash from our foreign subsidiaries for purposes of recording the provisional tax expense for the year ended october 31 2018 we are no longer asserting that earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested however the company has not completed its analysis and will make a final decision within the measurement period if the company changes its assertion to not indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings there will be more flexibility in using the cash from our foreign operations to fund future working capital in the united states

the 1825 million increase from noncash items compared to fiscal 2017 is primarily due to a 867 million increase in depreciation and amortization a 505 million release of a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired mainly from paragard impairment of intangibles of 244 million and an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 60 million 

the 1258 million increase in the net cash from changes in assets and liabilities compared to fiscal 2017 is mainly due to an increase in longterm liabilities of 1507 million primarily from a provisional tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of deferred foreign earnings under the 2017 act of 1415 million a 259 million increase in the net changes of inventories driven by acquisitions and higher raw materials to support production levels and a 623 million increase in accrued liabilities mainly due to increase in charge backs this increase is partially offset by a 344 million decrease in net changes in receivables a 511 million decrease in changes to prepayments and other assets primarily due to a 420 million payment to the uk tax authorities a 221 million decrease in net changes to accounts payable and a 55 million decrease in accrued income taxes

investing cash flow

accounting pronouncements 

information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements 

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

 goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of our goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition 

we test goodwill impairment in accordance with asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  we perform a qualitative assessment to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

carrying amount the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the carrying amount which exceeds the reporting units fair value a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

 

as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations to the extent reasonable and practical we may decide to reduce the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely at october 31 2018  a uniform hypothetical 5 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would have resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease in approximately 300 million in operating income for the fiscal year ended october 31 2018  for additional information see item 1a risk factors   our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results ” and see note 1 accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for additional information

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and monthly dailies are the fastest growing modality in the contact lens segment and comprised approximately 49 and 46 of the contact lens market in 2017 and 2016 respectively representing a growth of approximately 12 based on recent market estimates trailing twelve months through september 

coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding we believe this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc and alcon formerly ciba vision corporation owned by novartis ag 

coopervisions primary competitors in the contact lens business have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

over the past decade competition has continued to shift its focus as an example the contact lens industry has experienced a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses that now represent approximately 80 of the monthly and two week modalities and 26 of the single use modality of the contact lens market coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products biofinity monthly spherical toric and multifocal lenses avaira ®  and avaira vitality tm  twoweek spherical and toric lenses clariti 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses and myday singleuse spherical and toric lenses the clariti 1day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide coopervision with the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market 

in addition to a broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses coopervision competes based on the fact that its three manufacturing processes allow coopervision to produce a broad range of spheres toric and multifocal

market for womens and family reproductive health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for family health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery hospitals and surgical centers obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to obgyns in the united states to increase over the next decade office visit activity related to menopause abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are expected to increase slightly over the next decade driving the growth is a growing population of women over the age of 65 according to the united states census estimates a large and stable middleaged population and a steady number of reproductive age women with increasing fertility issues as well as women interested in contraception that is reversible such as with the paragard ®  iud coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

recent trends in the united states market include the development of more costeffective health care delivery models including moving treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for our medical devices

government regulation 

medical device and pharmaceutical regulation 

most of our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior notice to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of pma applications the fda aims to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence in reviewing a premarket notification the fda may request additional information including clinical data which may significantly prolong the review process if the fda agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market it will grant 510k clearance to commercially market the device if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device the device is automatically designated as a class iii device the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo  process 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

following receipt of a pma application the fda conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review if it is not the agency will refuse to file the pma if it is the fda will accept the application for filing and begin the review the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided and the fda may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant requesting the applicants response to deficiencies communicated by the fda the fda considers a pma or pma supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an fda request for information eg major deficiency letter within 180 days after the fda issues such request also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials for medical devices 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda some types of studies deemed to present nonsignificant risk are deemed to have an approved ide once certain requirements are addressed and irb approval is obtained if the device presents a significant risk to human health as defined by the fda the sponsor must submit an ide application to the fda and obtain ide approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks t o human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation of medical devices 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations that requires changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements which are subject to new legislation and change can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

our genetic testing laboratory services are not currently regulated by the fda or foreign ministries of health although the fda has statutory authority to regulate in vitro diagnostic products ivds used for clinical purposes as medical devices and to assure that such products are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldts which are a subset of ivds that are intended for clinical use and designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory we believe our genetic laboratory tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

even though we commercialize our tests as ldts our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda 

pharmaceutical regulation 

our paragard intrauterine copper contraceptive is regulated by the fda as a drug 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and its implementing regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as the fda’s refusal to approve pending ndas withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold issuance of warning letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 

any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including manufacturing periodic reporting product sampling and distribution advertising promotion drug shortage reporting compliance with any postapproval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as phase 4 clinical trials a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems and surveillance recordkeeping and reporting requirements including adverse experiences 

after approval most changes to the approved product such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to further testing requirements and prior fda review and approval there also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any approved products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the fda and these state agencies for compliance with good manufacturing practices or cgmps and other requirements which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our thirdparty manufacturers 

changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior fda approval before being implemented or fda notification fda regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cgmps and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any thirdparty manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance 

later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product including aes of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations imposition of postmarket studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a rems program among other consequences 

the fda closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy purity and potency that are approved by the fda physicians in their independent professional medical judgement may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda we however are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs for uses outside of the approved labeling 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products including samples is subject to the prescription drug marketing act pdma which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution the drug supply chain security act also imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and tracing 

failure to comply with any of the fda’s requirements which are subject to new legislation and change could result in significant adverse enforcement actions these include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as refusal to approve pending applications license suspension or revocation withdrawal of an approval imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials warning letters untitled letters cyber letters modification of promotional materials or labeling product recalls product seizures or detentions refusal to allow imports or exports total or partial suspension of production or distribution debarment injunctions fines consent decrees corporate integrity agreements refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs restitution disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment it is also possible that failure to comply with the fda’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws as well as state consumer protection laws any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity among other adverse consequences 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies in other countries must approve new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements cooper also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws physician payment transparency laws and laws pertaining to health information privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

in addition the federal government as part of the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could result in sanctions such as fines injunctions and civil penalties 

the impact to our businesses of the aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain the aca imposes a 23 percent excise tax with limited exceptions on any entity that manufactures or imports class i ii and iii medical devices offered for sale in the united states that began on january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense on our statement of income the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 imposed a two year moratorium of the device excise tax for device sales in calendar years 2016 and 2017 absent further legislative action the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting january 1 2018 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the aca or the impact of any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations for example the trump administration recently narrowed the aca mandate for employers and insurers to cover birth control pills and other contraceptives by expanding the types of entities that could invoke religious or moral beliefs to avoid the aca requirement the trump administration and the us congress may take further action regarding the aca including but not limited to repeal or replacement additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge 

raw materials 

coopervisions raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source in a few cases coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products supply of these materials is protected by contractual agreements and safety stocks however if current raw material suppliers fail to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets our products through our own field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision also sells to distributors and to mass merchandisers who offer eye care services to support the sale and use of coopervision products coopervision engages in various activities and offers a variety of services these include clinical training digital marketing for the customer ecommerce telemarketing social media and journal advertisements coopervision also invested in tools that allow our customers to offer their patients monthly purchase and delivery subscriptions in certain smaller countries coopervision often uses distributors and leverages our distributors sales and marketing resources to attract major customers to coopervision 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors coopersurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows professional educational programs and internet promotions including ecommerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our largest competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc and alcon owned by novartis ag may have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contact lens industry also continues to evolve with respect to the introduction of new distribution and fulfillment models and service technologies which may conflict with coopervision’s strategy or interfere with its customers’ relationships and loyalty for example more contact lenses are being fulfilled directly to the consumer by manufacturers and wholesalers via online platforms telemedicine is gaining popularity and more vision correction prescriptions are being provided through online refractive exams rather than in office by an eye care practitioner coopervision’s failure to adapt to the threats posed by these new and emerging distribution models and internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in the womens health care market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians hospitals and ivf clinics coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and more recently at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations coopervision acquired paragon vision sciences subsequent to fiscal 2017 procornea and grand vista llc in fiscal 2017 and soflex in fiscal 2016 coopersurgical acquired paragard subsequent to fiscal 2017 wallace in fiscal 2017 reprogenetics uk recombine ksystems genesis genetics the pipette company and research instruments in fiscal 2016 and reprogenetics us in fiscal 2015 these acquisitions added operations to coopervision and coopersurgical respectively and expanded their international businesses the acquisitions have correspondingly added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical has not allocated substantial resources to new product development but rather it has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical has recently invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy coopervision invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care and diagnostics testing industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices and genetic testing technology may limit demand for our products and services corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2017 and 2016 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues concerns about the euro zone’s sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal 2017 uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers suppliers and other business partners if our customers’ financial conditions are adversely affected customers may reduce their purchases of our products or we may not be able to collect accounts receivable each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations or financial results 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations with significant business operations in europe including in the united kingdom in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from march 29 2017 the date the government of the united kingdom formally initiated the withdrawal process the pending withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union 

this development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union would have and how such withdrawal could affect or could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability and near term financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico hungary costa rica and the united states coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in connecticut texas and denmark in november 2017 coopersurgical purchased a manufacturing facility in costa rica to consolidate a portion of global manufacturing we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of the united states the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in connecticut and denmark any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting largely of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice for example some of the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by a sole supplier we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if our suppliers particularly those which are the sole source of any necessary material fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision in the past faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we are also exposed to the danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar among other currencies we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the united kingdom tax authorities uk tax authorities enacted a new diverted profits tax dpt as of april 1 2015 on profits of multinationals that they deemed artificially diverted from the united kingdom the tax rate is 25 dpt is intended to apply in two situations a where a foreign company has artificially avoided having a taxable presence in the united kingdom and b where a group adopts a structure which lacks economic substance in order to divert profits from the united kingdom 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the uk tax authorities have begun an inquiry regarding the application of dpt to us for fiscal year 2015 we believe that the transactions in question were at arm’s length with no intention to divert profit from the united kingdom and therefore are outside the intended reach of the dpt 

on december 20 2017 the uk tax authorities issued a dpt charging notice of approximately gbp 31 million with respect to the transfer out of the united kingdom of certain intellectual property rights in connection with the 2014 acquisition of sauflon pharmaceutical ltd although the taxes were paid on the transfer the uk tax authorities are challenging the value assigned to such property we intend to contest the charging notice vigorously the process for resolving such a notice can be lengthy and could involve litigation the company is cooperating with the tax authorities to resolve this issue the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are involved in much of the coordinated activity although the timing and methods of implementation vary several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with and in some cases exceeds the scope of the oecds recommendations in the us a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate or balance sheet at this time on december 22 2017 the us president signed the tax reform legislation into law the impact of tax reform is still being evaluated by the company and will be reflected in our fiscal first quarter of 2018 changes in corporate tax rates the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in significant onetime charges in the period in which tax reform is enacted and could result in an increase of the company’s effective tax rate 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system at coopervision implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

we attempt to protect our computer and communications systems but may experience interruptions and breaches including computer viruses malicious software cyberattacks and hacking” that could impair our ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with our customers or result in the theft of trade secrets or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise privacy of our sensitive information or that of our customers or other business partners 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have antitakeover effects our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” expired on october 29 2017 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical devices design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products increase the cost of compliance impose additional regulatory requirements on us or otherwise impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our product candidates if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn the value of our company and our operating results may be adversely affected 

the fda’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates for example in december 2016 the 21st century cures act cures act was signed into law the cures act among other things is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and medical devices and spur innovation but its ultimate implementation is unclear if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability which would adversely affect our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we also cannot predict the likelihood nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action either in the united states such as new policies introduced by the trump administration or abroad 

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services

with our acquisition of reprogenetics us in august 2015 genesis genetics in march 2016 recombine in may 2016 and reprogenetics uk in may 2016 we now offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldts we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldts have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldts is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldts our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldts it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldts or new legislation regulations or guidance may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our products and to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratory must be certified under clia in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in the united states and internationally in canada and the united kingdom and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry both in the united states and internationally as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

the affordable care act aca made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the aca of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future additionally recent reform proposals have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations could have a material effect on our balance sheet and results of operations 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the european economic area eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

the medical devices regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication while the invitro diagnostic medical devices regulation will only become applicable five years after publication once applicable the new regulations will among other things 

 

 

 

 

 these modifications may have an impact on the way we conduct our business in the eea and an adverse impact on our overall business operations and financial results 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

state and federal laws and regulations including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa govern the collection dissemination use privacy confidentiality security availability and integrity of individually identifiable information including protected health information phi hipaa establishes basic national privacy and security standards for protection of phi by covered entities such as our genetics testing subsidiaries and the business associates with whom such entities contract for services including another one of our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals hipaa requires both covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures for phi that is used or disclosed and to adopt administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect phi when we are acting as a business associate our clients that are covered entities are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us  known as business associate agreements  that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa our genetics testing subsidiaries are likewise required to enter into business associate agreements with any of their business associates 

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations can be significant a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

we maintain safeguards that we believe are reasonable and appropriate to protect the privacy and security of phi and other personally identifiable information consistent with applicable law and our contractual obligations however our systems may be vulnerable to physical breakins viruses hackers and other potential sources of security breaches in addition we may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to phi by our employees or contractors any such breaches could result in exposure to liability under federal and state laws andor under our contractual arrangements and could adversely impact our business 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in countries other than united states covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations for example the eu data protection directive as implemented into national laws by the eu member states imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the processing of personal data the new euwide general data protection regulation gdpr entered into force in may 2016 and will become applicable on may 25 2018 replacing the current data protection laws of each eu member state the gdpr will implement more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data including for example expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used limitations on retention of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by european data protection authorities fines and penalties for example of up to 20000000 euros or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher under the gdpr and eprivacy regulation litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to health care practitioners that sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to health care practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the aca among other things amended the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the aca also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute in addition federal government price reporting laws changed by the aca to among other things increase the minimum medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and offer such rebates to additional populations that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement andor discounts on our marketed drugs participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products increased infrastructure costs and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

in this section we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  and the results of our operations for fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” within the tables presented percentages are calculated based on the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate exactly from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 

outlook 

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and general health care markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including but not limited to the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility debt concerns the uncertainty caused by the united kingdoms intention to withdraw from the european union and the trend of consolidation within the health care industry impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our future performance 

coopervision   we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform ®  technology and phosphorylcholine technology pc technology™ we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions 

on december 1 2017 subsequent to fiscal 2017 coopervision acquired paragon vision sciences a leading provider of orthokeratology orthok specialty contact lenses and oxygen permeable rigid contact lens materials for approximately 800 million in fiscal 2017 we acquired procornea a netherlands based manufacturer of specialty contact lenses which expands coopervisions access to myopia nearsightedness management markets with new products and grand vista llc a distributor in russia of soft contact lenses in fiscal 2016 we acquired soflex an israeli manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow and this material represents about half of the industry our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability coopervision manufactures and markets a wide variety of silicone hydrogel contact lenses within the daily twoweek and monthly modalities along with manufacturing some of these lenses as toric andor multifocal lenses we market these lenses under a number of different brand names including but not limited to biofinity ®  clariti ® myday ®  and avaira ®  

we believe that the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue growing and our singleuse silicone hydrogel products represent an opportunity for our business our clariti 1day brand provides the only singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses in the marketplace with a complete line of spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses we expect increasing aggregate demand for clariti 1day and myday products as well as future singleuse products

coopervision net sales 

the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly coopervision offers spherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities 

singleuse lenses are designed for daily replacement and frequently replaced lenses are designed for twoweek or monthly replacement significantly the market for spherical lenses is growing with valueadded spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms to reduce eye fatigue from use of digital devices to add aspherical optical properties andor higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 

we manufacture coopervision’s silicone hydrogel biofinity brand spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses avaira brand spherical and toric lenses and myday brand spherical and toric lenses using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear our silicone hydrogel clariti brand spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses are available in monthly and singleuse modalities we believe the clariti singleuse silicone hydrogel lens products provide a competitive advantage in approved markets as clariti is the only singleuse silicone hydrogel lens available in all vision correction categories  spherical toric and multifocal 

coopervision’s proclear brand aspheric toric and multifocal contact lenses manufactured using pc technology tm  help enhance tissuedevice compatibility and offer improved lens comfort 

coopervision net sales by category 



in fiscal 2017 coopervisions toric and multifocal lenses grew largely through the success of our biofinity clariti and myday portfolios offset by declines in older hydrogel products singleuse sphere lenses growth was largely attributed to clariti and myday lenses offset by declines in older hydrogel products non singleuse spheres grew largely on sales of biofinity offset by declines in older hydrogel products the term other products primarily includes lens care approximately 3 of net sales in fiscal 2017 total silicone hydrogel products including clariti biofinity avaira and myday grew 16 in fiscal 2017 representing 65 of net sales compared to 60 in the prior fiscal year

coopervision fiscal 2017 net sales growth was partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations which had a negative impact on net sales of 198 million americas net sales growth was primarily due to market gains of silicone hydrogel contact lenses including biofinity clariti and myday partially offset by a decrease in sales of older hydrogel lens products emea net sales growth was largely due to market gains of silicone hydrogel contact lenses including biofinity clariti and myday offset by a decrease in sales of older hydrogel products and weakening foreign currencies primarily the british pound compared to the prior year against the united states dollar for the first three fiscal quarters and euro for the first half of the fiscal year net sales in the asia pacific region grew on market gains of silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses including biofinity clariti and myday partially offset by weakening foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen for the second half of the fiscal year 

coopervision’s net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold including recently introduced silicone hydrogel products while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision’s net sales average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth 

coopersurgical net sales 

coopersurgical supplies the market for family health care with a diversified portfolio of products and services for use in surgical and other medical procedures that are performed primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists in hospitals surgical centers fertility clinics and in the medical office fertility offerings include highly specialized products and services that target the in vitro fertilization ivf process with a goal to make fertility treatment safer more efficient and convenient 



coopersurgicals net sales increase in fertility products compared to the prior year period was mainly due to incremental sales from products and services of acquired companies the net sales of medical office and surgical procedures remained relatively flat in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year due to declines in sales of disposable products partially offset by growth in recently launched products used in surgical procedures unit growth and product mix primarily sales of recently acquired products and services influenced sales growth net sales growth was partially offset by the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies compared to the united states dollar during the year

cost of salesgross profit 



coopervisions increase in gross margin in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity and favorable currency impact to coopervisions cost of sales primarily led by the weakening of the british pound compared to the united states dollar coopervisions cost of sales included 172 million from 109 million of primarily incremental costs associated with the impact of hurricane maria on our puerto rico manufacturing facility 57 million of product write off costs related to the product transition from avaira sphere to avaira vitality and 06 million of facility start up costs in the fiscal year ended october 31 2017 fiscal 2016 gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher restructuring and integrations costs described below 

coopervisions gross margin in fiscal 2016 remained flat compared to fiscal 2015 gross margin was impacted positively from an increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity offset by the negative effects of foreign currency changes that unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar fiscal 2016 and 2015 gross margins were negatively impacted by product and equipment rationalization charges and the related severance costs arising from our review of sauflons products materials and manufacturing processes and facility startup costs of 652 million and 696 million respectively 

coopersurgical’s sequential decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to a change in product mix arising from sales of recently acquired lower margin products and services coopersurgicals fiscal 2017 cost of sales included 58 million of integration costs compared to 44 million in fiscal 2016 

selling general and administrative expense sga 



the increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was due to investments to support our long term objectives including increased headcount in sales and ga investments in information technology and higher distribution expenses to support revenue growth coopervisions sga in fiscal 2017 included 91 million of legal costs and 47 million of acquisition and integration costs legal costs related to litigation of class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers relating to unilateral pricing policy upp including a settlement accrual of 30 million 

the decrease in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower litigation settlement legal and related lobbying costs consisting of 29 million in the current year compared to 198 million in the fiscal 2015 the litigation legal and related lobbying costs were related to upp as well as a 170 million settlement made to jjvc in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 the reduction

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in sga expense is also due to lower sauflon restructuring and integration activities of approximately 90 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 245 million in fiscal 2015 coopervisions sga excluding legal restructuring and integration activities discussed above increased in fiscal 2016 due to investment in sales and marketing including headcount to promote our silicone hydrogel products and to reach new customers and support geographic expansion 

the increase in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars was primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of acquired companies and investment in headcount to support growth coopersurgicals sga included 163 million of primarily acquisition and integration expenses of acquired companies compared to 113 million in fiscal 2016 

the increase in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars is primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of recently acquired companies as well as 113 million of acquisition and integration expenses in fiscal 2016 compared to 49 million in fiscal 2015 coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers 

the increase in corporate sga in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to share based compensation related expenses the decrease in corporate sga in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower sharebased compensation costs and efficiencies achieved as a result of cost control measures 

research and development expense rd 



coopervisions research and development rd remained relatively flat in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease in coopervisions rd expense in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to synergies resulting from the integration of sauflon in fiscal 2016 coopervision recorded 02 million in charges primarily for severance costs compared to 46 million in fiscal 2015 primarily for equipment rationalization and severance costs related to integration activities coopervisions rd activities are primarily focused on the development of contact lenses and manufacturing improvements 

the sequential increases in coopersurgicals rd in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015 in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased activity to bring newly acquired products to market increased investment in projects to develop new products and the upgrade of existing products as a percentage of sales rd expense remained flat coopersurgicals rd activities include in vitro fertilization product development and the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices

amortization of intangibles 



the sequential increases in amortization were due primarily to amortization of intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions by coopersurgical the decrease in coopervisions amortization in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016 was due to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized and due to a charge of 23 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2016 discussed below 

the increase in coopervisions amortization expense in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 was due to a charge of 23 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2016 to write off acquired inprocess research and development we expect amortization in fiscal 2018 to be approximately 180 million in each of our fiscal quarters primarily due to intangible assets acquired through our acquisitions offset by intangible assets which we forecast to become fully amortized this does not include amortization of intangible assets acquired subsequent to the fiscal year 2017 

restructuring and integration costs 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in connection with the sauflon acquisition our coopervision business unit initiated restructuring and integration activities to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies the 2014 sauflon integration plan activities included workforce reductions consolidation of duplicative facilities and product rationalization as of october 31 2016 our activities related to this restructuring and integration plan were essentially complete the total restructuring costs under this plan were 1483 million  as discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

in fiscal 2016 we recorded in cost of sales 564 million of expense arising from productionrelated asset disposals accelerated depreciation on equipment and inventory rationalization primarily related to older lens products based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon we recorded in cost of sales 11 million of employee termination costs we recorded in selling general and administrative expense a reduction of 11 million due to a decrease in expected employee termination payments and we recorded 02 million of expense for lease termination costs in addition coopervision incurred 100 million of integration costs in fiscal 2016 included in operating expenses 

in fiscal 2015 we recorded in cost of sales 577 million  of expense arising from productionrelated asset disposals and accelerated depreciation on equipment primarily related to our hydrogel lenses based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon we recorded in cost of sales 40 million  of employee termination costs we recorded in selling general and administrative expense a reduction of 72 million  as a result of decreased estimates in expected employee termination costs and voluntary terminations and we recorded 04 million  of expense for lease termination costs we recorded in research and development expense 07 million  of employee termination costs in addition coopervision incurred 352 million  of integration costs in fiscal 2015 included in operating expenses 

we may from time to time decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods

operating income 



the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in consolidated gross margins the increase in coopervision operating income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increase in sales and gross margin primarily from higher margin products including biofinity and lower restructuring and integration costs compared to fiscal 2016 as discussed above the decrease in coopersurgical operating income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to higher operating expenses relating to acquisitions and investments to support growth 

the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net sales in addition the companys total operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2016 decreased by 3 compared to fiscal 2015 which had a corresponding increase in operating income as a percentage of sales the increase in coopervision operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to decreases in expenses relating to legal and restructuring and integration costs primarily related to sauflon as discussed above recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses in addition to the 170 million litigation settlement made in 2015 as discussed above coopersurgicals operating income increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to an increase in sales of higher margin legacy products as a result of our investment in sales and promotional activities to reach new customers as well as recently launched products partially offset by the sales of recently acquired lower margin products and services and the increase in total operating expenses 

interest expense 



sequential increases in interest expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales reflect higher average debt balances as a result of debt incurred in connection with acquisitions as well as higher interest rates fiscal 2017 interest expense also included 22 million of bridge loan facility fees that were incurred related to the paragard acquisition as discussed in note 15 subsequent events 

current debt outstanding at october 31 2017 includes the 8300 million term loan entered on march 1 2016 and 3230 million borrowed under the revolving credit agreement we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2018 due to the new 1425 billion term loan entered into on november 1 2017 to fund the paragard acquisition

other expense income net 



other expense in fiscal 2017 includes a 02 million foreign exchange loss on forward contracts related to an acquisition other expense in fiscal 2016 includes a 06 million foreign exchange loss on forward contracts related to an acquisition and a 04 million loss related to extinguishment of debt 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 211 million  in fiscal 2017 compared to 207 million  in fiscal 2016 our effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income was 53 70 and 48 for fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the etr in fiscal 2017 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2016 due to the shift in the geographic mix of income as well as discrete benefits from adopting asu 20169 excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation the etr in fiscal 2016 increased in comparison to fiscal 2015 due to an increase in foreign nondeductible integration and transaction expenses partially offset by renewal of the rd tax credit and lower state income taxes 

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our taxable income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income has decreased over recent fiscal years effectively lowering the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states 

the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 1146 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 38 in our fiscal year 2017 compared to 812 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 35 in our fiscal year 2016 the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

share repurchases 

in december 2011 our board of directors authorized the 2012 share repurchase program and through subsequent amendments the most recent in march 2017 the total repurchase authorization was increased from 5000 million to 10 billion of the companys common stock the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time we repurchased 108 thousand shares of our common stock for 255 million at an average purchase price of 23712 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and repurchased 150 thousand shares of our common stock for 295 million at an average purchase price of 19682 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 at october 31 2017 we had remaining authorization to repurchase 5635 million of our common stock 

we did not repurchase any shares during fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2015 we repurchased 468 thousand shares of our common stock for 673 million at an average purchase price of 14393 per share

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017 was 372 million and 114 million respectively compared to 299 million and 90 million respectively in fiscal 2016 as of october 31 2017 there was 754 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 107 million for stock options 600 million for restricted stock units and 47 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 31 years for nonvested stock options 32 years for restricted stock units and 13 years for performance shares net payments proceeds related to sharebased compensation awards for the fiscal years ended october 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were approximately 53 million  72 million  and 48 million  respectively net payments relate to tax withholding for sharebased compensation arrangements 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2017 would have increased by approximately 400 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2017 would have increased by approximately 151 

we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjust the rate of expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

we grant performance units to certain key employees that provide for the issuance of common stock if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if the goals are not achieved or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized

these standards we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned based on terms of sale with the customer where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists delivery has occurred the sellers price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for contact lenses as well as coopersurgical medical devices surgical instruments accessories diagnostic products and services this primarily occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers andor when services are rendered we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements we record based on historical statistics estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts promotional and advertising allowances volume discounts contractual pricing allowances rebates and specifically established customer product return programs we record taxes collected from customers on a net basis as these taxes are not included in net sales 

 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we adopted asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment where fasb eliminated step 2 from the goodwill impairment test which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation   we performed a qualitative assessment to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with its carrying amount and an impairment charge will be recognized for the carrying amount which exceeds the reporting units fair value a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of our goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on coopers common stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations to the extent reasonable and practical we may decide to reduce the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely at 31 october 2017 a uniform hypothetical 5 decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would have resulted in a decrease in approximately 250 million in operating income for the fiscal year ended 31 october 2017 for additional information see item 1a risk factors   our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertaintes which could affect our operating results”  and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities including the revolving credit agreement and term loans may vary with the federal funds rate and london interbank offered rate libor we may decrease this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt 

subsequent to the fiscal year ended october 31 2017 on november 1 2017 in connection with the paragard acquisition we entered into a new fiveyear 1425 billion senior unsecured term loan agreement by and among the company the lenders party thereto and dnb bank as administrative agent the company used part of the facility to fund acquisition of paragard and used the remainder of the funds to partially repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement we are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rates on this term loan varies with the libor 

on march 1 2016 we entered into a syndicated revolving credit and term loan agreement 2016 credit agreement with keybank as administrative agent the new agreement provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 8300 million the 2016 credit agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay our other outstanding term loans and for 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

general corporate purposes at october 31 2017  we had 6767 million available under the revolving credit facility and 8300 million outstanding under the term loan 

on august 4 2014 we entered into a threeyear 7000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement with a maturity date of august 4 2017 there was no amortization of the principal and we could prepay the loan balances from time to time in whole or in part without premium or penalty we repaid 4930 million of the outstanding balance in fiscal 2016 and fully repaid the remaining 2070 million of the outstanding balance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 

on september 12 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement with a maturity date of september 12 2018 subject to amortization of principal of 5 per year payable quarterly beginning october 31 2016 with the balance payable at maturity we repaid 150 million of the outstanding balance in fiscal 2016 and fully repaid the remaining 2850 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 using the funds from the 2016 credit agreement 

see note 5 debt for additional information 



at october 31 2017  the scheduled maturities of our fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates 



as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2017  it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2017  we had no interest rate swap outstanding if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately 111 million based on average debt outstanding for the fiscal 2017 for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors  “we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt” and note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper we or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 is a global medical device company publicly traded on the nyse euronext nyse coo cooper is dedicated to being a quality of life company tm  with a focus on shareholder value cooper operates through two business units coopervision inc and coopersurgical inc 

  

coopervision is a global manufacturer providing products for contact lens wearers coopervision develops manufactures and markets a broad range of singleuse twoweek and monthly contact lenses featuring advanced materials and optics coopervisions products are designed to solve vision challenges such as astigmatism presbyopia ocular dryness and eye fatigue with a broad collection of spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses coopervisions products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico hungary costa rica and new york coopervision distributes products out of its facilities in new york the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

coopersurgicals business competes in the general health care market with a focus on advancing the health of families through a diversified portfolio of products and services focusing on womens health fertility and genetic testing coopersurgical customers are health care professionals and institutions providing care to individuals within these areas including point of health care delivery in the hospital clinicians office and fertility clinics coopersurgicals major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in connecticut texas denmark and various smaller international locations with diagnostic facilities located in multiple locations including california florida illinois michigan new jersey oregon texas and internationally in canada and the united kingdom 

coopervision and coopersurgical each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry is dynamic and involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations both of coopers businesses compete predominantly on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly dailies are the fastest modality in the contact lens segment and comprised approximately 46 and 44 of the contact lens market in 2016 and 2015 respectively representing a growth of approximately 10 based on recent market estimates 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous categories of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding we believe this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow and this product material represents about 79 of the monthly and two week modalities and 23 of the single use modality of the contact lens market silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving success in our business silicone hydrogel lenses now represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity ®  brand is coopervisions leading product line under the biofinity ®  brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products 

coopervision markets singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti ®  1day brand and singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses under myday ®  our clariti 1day brand provides the only singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses in the marketplace with a complete line of spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses we also compete effectively in the traditional hydrogel singleuse product segment with several lenses including our proclear ®  1 day lenses we believe the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that our competitive silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel product offerings represent an opportunity for our business 

coopervisions proclear line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a material that incorporates phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim … may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear which is important as mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens use 

in addition to its pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with other traditional hydrogel products 

contact lens product sales 

spheres net sales of coopervisions spherical lenses represented 55 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2016 including net sales of singleuse spherical lens that represented 26 percent of net sales in the fiscal year non singleuse spherical lens represented 29 percent of net sales in fiscal 2016 

toric net sales of coopervisions toric lenses represented 30 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2016 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

multifocal net sales of multifocal lenses represented 11 percent of net sales in the fiscal year 

silicone hydrogel  coopervisions silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products including biofinity clariti avaira and myday products represented 60 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2016 

proclear net sales of coopervisions pc technology spherical toric and multifocal products including proclear 1 day sphere and multifocal products represented 19 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2016 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon formerly ciba vision corporation owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc 

coopervisions primary competitors in the contact lens business have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

over the past decade competition has continued to shift its focus as an example the contact lens industry has experienced a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses that now represent approximately 79 of the monthly and two week modalities and 23 of the single use modality of the contact lens market coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with its following products biofinity monthly spherical toric and multifocal lenses avaira ®  and avaira vitality tm  twoweek spherical and toric lenses clariti 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses and myday singleuse spherical and toric lenses the clariti 1day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provide coopervision with the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market 

in the toric lens market a similar shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses has occurred but we believe that lens manufacturers also continue to compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners coopervision competes based on the fact that its three manufacturing processes allow coopervision to produce a broad range of toric lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

coopersurgical competes in the global invitro fertilization ivf market with a product portfolio of ivf media and assisted reproductive technology solutions designed to enhance the work of fertility professionals to the benefit of families 

we have continued to invest in coopersurgicals business through the acquisition of companies and product lines for new or complementary products and services for the ivf process subsequent to our year end in november 2016 we acquired wallace the ivf segment of smiths medical international ltd in our fiscal third quarter of 2016 we acquired the commercial assets of recombine inc a clinical genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening kivex biotec as ksystems a manufacturer and distributor of equipment for ivf clinics and reprogenetics uk a genetics laboratory specializing in service offerings of preimplantation genetic screening pgs and preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd used during the ivf process in our fiscal second quarter of 2016 coopersurgical acquired genesis genetics inc a genetics laboratory specializing in pgs and pgd used during the ivf process and the pipette company a manufacturer and distributor of micro pipettes for the assisted reproductive technology art market in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 coopersurgical acquired research instruments limited a manufacturer and supplier of ivf medical devices and systems finally in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 coopersurgical acquired reprogenetics a genetics laboratory in the us specializing in service offerings of pgs and pgd used during the ivf process we intend to continue investing in coopersurgicals business with the goal of expanding our integrated solutions model within the areas of women’s health fertility and diagnostics 

market for womens and family reproductive health care 

coopersurgical participates in the market for womens health care with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of health care delivery primarily hospitals and surgical centers obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to obgyns in the united states to increase over the next decade office visit activity related to menopause including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are expected to increase slightly over the next decade driving the growth is a steady number of reproductive age women with increasing fertility issues a large and stable middleaged population and a growing population of women over the age of 65 according to united states census estimates coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond 

another trend in the market for womens health care includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health care systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term we believe our broad product portfolio can be a benefit in this changing environment as health systems look to standardize and consolidate vendors 

the response in the united states market to the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act affordable care act or aca includes the development of new models of health care delivery one goal of these new models is to deliver more costeffective health care including a trend to move treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for our medical devices 

some significant features of this market are

net sales of coopersurgical products used in office and surgical procedures represented 55 of coopersurgicals net sales in fiscal 2016 net sales of fertility products and services represented 45 of coopersurgicals net sales in fiscal 2016 

coopersurgical competition 

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the family and womens health care market supplying diagnostic products services and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians fertility clinics and hospitals coopersurgical competes based on our sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of our products coopersurgicals strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands its product line we also offer educational programs for medical professionals in the appropriate use of our products 

coopersurgical is seeking to expand our presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnsons ethicon endosurgery boston scientific olympus and medtronic these competitors have wellestablished positions within the operating room environment coopersurgical intends to leverage our   relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate our expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

coopersurgical also competes in the fertility category of the womens health care market we have broad product offerings for fertility evaluations and ivf procedures by obgyns reproductive endocrinologists and embryologists these include products for use by the obgyns in their offices for initial evaluations with office based hysteroscopy and first line treatments such as intrauterine insemination in fertility clinics our products include media micro tools and lab equipment and to improve ivf outcomes we offer testing services intended to increase implantation rates and decrease miscarriages 

coopersurgical intends to leverage our relationship with fertility clinics to expand our presence in the fertility market against competitors in the media and microtools categories that include vitrolife cook irvine scientific and life global and competitors in fertility and familial reproductive genetic testing that include natera good start genetics counsyl and igenomix 

research and development

government regulation 

medical device regulation 

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior notice to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of pma applications the fda aims to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device the fda will not clear the device although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence in reviewing a premarket notification the fda may request additional information including clinical data which may significantly prolong the review process 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks t o human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda and other government agency regulation 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations that requires changes to labeling and packaging and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda or other federal and state government agencies which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

laboratory developed tests 

our genetic testing laboratory services are not currently regulated by the fda or foreign ministries of health although the fda has statutory authority to regulate in vitro diagnostic products ivds used for clinical purposes as medical devices and to assure that such products are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests ldts which are a subset of ivds that are intended for clinical use and designed manufactured and used within a single laboratory we believe our genetic laboratory tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions even though we commercialize our tests as ldts our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies in other countries must approve new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements cooper also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws physician payment transparency laws and laws pertaining to health information privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

in addition the federal government as part of the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and health care professionals we are now required by the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed health care professionals certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking andor require the reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could result in sanctions such as fines injunctions and civil penalties 

the impact to our businesses of the aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain the aca imposes a 23 percent excise tax with limited exceptions on any entity that manufactures or imports class i ii and iii medical devices offered for sale in the united states that began on january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense on our statement of income on december 18 2015 president obama signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2016 which imposed a two year moratorium of the device excise tax for device sales in calendar years 2016 and 2017 absent further legislative action the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting january 1 2018 

raw materials 

coopervisions raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets our products through our own field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision also sells to distributors and to mass merchandisers who offer eye care services to support the sale and use of coopervision products coopervision engages in various activities and offers a variety of services these include clinical training digital marketing for the customer ecommerce telemarketing social media and journal advertisements coopervision recently launched tools that allow their customers to offer their patients monthly purchase and delivery subscriptions in certain smaller countries coopervision often uses distributors and leverages our distributors sales and marketing resources to attract major customers to coopervision 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors coopersurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows professional educational programs and internet promotions including ecommerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to our overall business the names of certain coopers products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect our intellectual property rights aggressively 

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of our principal business units other than our license agreement effective as of november 19 2007 between coopervision and ciba vision ag and ciba vision corporation now part of the novartis group of companies this license relates to patents covering coopervisions silicone hydrogel contact lens products our royalty obligations under this license agreement extend until the expiration of the applicable patent rights which we believe occurred in september 2014 in the united states and occurred for the most part in march 2016 outside of the united states 

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses we own certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

dependence on customers 

one customer a coopervision contact lens distributor accounted for approximately 11  of our consolidated net revenue in the fiscal year ended october 31 2016 and was approximately 10 in the fiscal year ended october 31 2014 no customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenue in the fiscal year ended october 31 2015 see note 13 business segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements 

government contracts 

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

backlog 

backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers business units

seasonality 

coopervisions contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

compliance with environmental laws 

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive health care industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc alcon owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb inc owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens health care market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and more recently at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations coopervision completed the acquisition of soflex in fiscal 2016 and sauflon pharmaceuticals limited in fiscal 2014 coopersurgical acquired wallace in november 2016 reprogenetics uk recombine ksystems genesis genetics the pipette company and research instruments in fiscal 2016 and reprogenetics us in fiscal 2015 these acquisitions added operations to coopervision and coopersurgical respectively and expanded their international businesses the acquisitions have correspondingly added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the health care industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical has not allocated substantial resources to new product development but rather it has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical has recently invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy coopervision invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care family and womens health care industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america latin america and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2016 and 2015 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues concerns about the euro zone’s sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains as a result we may have lower than historical performance for market growth in fiscal 2017 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

we are a multinational company headquartered in the united states with worldwide operations including significant business operations in europe including in the united kingdom in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum the referendum was advisory and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process nevertheless the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union 

this development has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union would have and how such withdrawal could affect or could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we face risks associated with disruption of our manufacturing and distribution operations including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes or idle or excess capacity could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete conversely excess or idle capacity which could result from acquisitions inaccurate sales forecasting or unexpected manufacturing efficiencies could significantly impact our profitability and near term financial condition 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico hungary costa rica and new york coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in connecticut texas and denmark we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of new york the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in connecticut and denmark any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting largely of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice for example some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by a sole supplier we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if our suppliers particularly those which are the sole source of any necessary material fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision has faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain a desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively and which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting beps and perceived international tax avoidance techniques the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are involved in much of the coordinated activity although the timing and methods of implementation vary additionally comprehensive us tax reform has been stated to be a priority for the us congress such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex integrated software and hardware information technology operating systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption or disruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

we utilize complex integrated software and hardware operating systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system at coopervision implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery there can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

we attempt to protect our computer and communications systems but may experience interruptions and breaches including computer viruses malicious software cyberattacks and hacking” that could impair our ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with our customers or result in the theft of trade secrets or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise privacy of our sensitive information or that of our customers or other business partners 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical devices design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products for example the fda recently has been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510k premarket clearance program in january 2011 the fda announced a plan of action that included twentyfive action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs some of the changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances for our products increase the cost of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties

increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

with our acquisition of reprogenetics in august 2015 genesis genetics in march 2016 recombine in may 2016 and reprogenetics uk in may 2016 we now offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth regulatory and legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future although the fda has statutory authority to assure that medical devices including ivds are safe and effective for their intended uses the fda has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the fdca and regulations with respect to ldts we believe our tests fall within the definition of an ldt as a result we believe our tests are not currently subject to the fda’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable fdca provisions however our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the fda legislative proposals addressing the fda’s oversight of ldts have been introduced by congress in the past and new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future the likelihood that congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the fda’s ability to enforce its medical device regulations with respect to certain ldts is difficult to predict at this time if the fda ultimately begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to ldts our genetic tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the fda the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the fda or instruction by congress if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation of ldts it could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

any new fda enforcement policies affecting ldts or new legislation regulations or guidance may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our products and to develop and introduce new products in the future which could reduce our revenue or increase our costs and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to comply with applicable federal state local and foreign laboratory licensing requirements we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business 

we are subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of disease our clinical laboratory must be certified under clia in order for us to perform testing on human specimens in addition our proprietary tests must also be recognized as part of our accredited programs under clia so that we can offer them in our laboratory clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications administration and participation in proficiency testing patient test management quality control quality assurance and inspections the law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state our laboratories are located in california florida illinois michigan new jersey oregon texas and internationally in canada and the united kingdom and we must maintain the requisite licenses in each jurisdiction

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results

changes in legislation and government regulation of the health care industry as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of health care could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of health care reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments in march 2010 president obama signed the affordable care act aca the aca makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the affordable care act of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future particularly in the light of the pending change in administrations following the us presidential election 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to the bipartisan budget act of 2015 will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition on april 16 2015 president obama signed into law the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 or macra which among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of health care reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering health care although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enroll as innetwork providers and suppliers with certain payors although becoming an innetwork provider or enrolling as a supplier means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates it does not obligate any physicians to order our tests or guarantee that we will receive reimbursement for our tests from these or any other payors at adequate levels thus these payor relationships or any similar relationships we may establish in the future may not result in acceptable levels of reimbursement for our tests or meaningful increases in our physician customer base we cannot predict whether under what circumstances or at what payment levels payors will cover and reimburse for our tests if we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited and our future prospects and our business could suffer 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain health care transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common health care transactions including health care claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the americas recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 the final omnibus privacy security breach notification and enforcement rules omnibus final rule implementing hipaa and hitech became effective in september 2013 under the hitech act and the omnibus final 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

rule certain of hipaas privacy and security standards are now directly applicable to covered entities business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act and the omnibus final rule set forth new notification requirements and standards for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions while there is no private right of action under hipaa that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for violations hipaa’s standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health information further varying state laws governing the use and disclosure of personally indentifiable information may be more restrictive than hipaa which means that entities subject to them must comply with the more restrictive state law in addition to complying with hipaa in some cases a breach may be required to be reported under state law and affected individuals notified even if the breach is not reportable or subject to breach notification requirements under hipaa state laws may impose separate fines and penalties upon violators and some unlike hipaa may afford a private right of action to state residents who believe their information has been misused 

  

our genetics testing subsidiaries are covered entities under hipaa one other subsidiary eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals may be a covered entity or business associate under hipaa similarly many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain hipaa protected health information that we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information if the government determines that our other subsidiaries are a covered entity business associate or subcontractor of a covered entity or subcontractor we could be faced with additional costs related to hipaa compliance and subject to governmental enforcement for failure to comply with hipaa which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and reputation 

laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

indeed changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to health care practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to health care practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the aca among other things amended the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal health care fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the aca also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

ethical legal and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our tests 

genetic testing has raised ethical legal and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information government authorities could for social or other purposes limit or regulate the use of genetic information or genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions particularly for those that have no known cure similarly these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use or physicians to be reluctant to order genetic tests even if permissible these and other ethical legal and social concerns may limit market acceptance and adoption of our tests or reduce the potential markets for our tests either of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

outlook 

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and health care markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility european debt concerns the uncertainty caused by the united kingdoms election to withdraw from the european union and the trend of consolidation within the health care industry impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2017 

coopervision  we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform ®  technology and phosphorylcholine technology pc technology™ we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration of recently introduced products and we continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions 

on august 6 2014 we acquired sauflon pharmaceuticals limited sauflon a privatelyheld european manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions the acquisition of sauflon expanded our contact lens product portfolio particularly with sauflons clariti ®  1day brand of singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lenses on september 6 2016 we acquired soflex a privatelyheld isreali manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions the acquisition of soflex expanded our market presence in israel

coopervisions gross margin in fiscal 2016 remained flat compared to fiscal 2015 gross margin was impacted positively from an increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity offset by the negative effects of foreign currency changes that unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar fiscal 2016 and 2015 gross margins were negatively impacted by product and equipment rationalization charges and the related severance costs arising from our review of sauflons products materials and manufacturing processes and facility startup costs of 652 million and 696 million respectively

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to operating expenses of sauflon coopervisions sga also included approximately 245 million primarily for restructuring and integration costs largely made up of professional fees and personnel related costs for transitional employees related to sauflon restructuring and integration activities fiscal 2015 sga expenses also include 198 million of litigation settlement and legal costs of which 170 million relates to the settlement to intellectual property claims by jjvc as well as litigation costs relating to the class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers distributors and retailers relating to upp 

the increase in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars is primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses of recently acquired companies as well as 113 million of acquisition and integration expenses in fiscal 2016 compared to 49 million in the prior year coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers 

the decrease in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to efficiencies as a result of cost control measures partially offset by approximately 49 million primarily for integration costs and costs related to the acquisition of reprogenetics in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 the increase in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a percentage of net sales reflects the acquisition and acquisition costs along with lower net sales in the current year coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers

research and development expense rd 



the decrease in coopervisions research and development rd expense in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales is primarily due to synergies resulting from the integration of sauflon in fiscal 2016 coopervision recorded 02 million in charges primarily for severance costs compared to 46 million in fiscal 2015 primarily for equipment rationalization and severance costs related to integration activities coopervisions rd activities are primarily focused on the development of contact lenses and manufacturing improvements 

the increase in coopervisions rd in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the inclusion of sauflon rd activities and 46 million in charges primarily for equipment rationalization and severance costs related to integration activities 

the increases in coopersurgicals rd in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 in absolute dollars is largely due to increased activity to bring newly acquired products to market increased investment in projects to develop new products and the upgrade of existing products as a percentage of sales rd expense remained flat coopersurgicals rd activities include in vitro fertilization product development and the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices 

the increase in coopersurgicals rd in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales is primarily due to increased activity to bring newly acquired products to market increased investment in projects to develop new products and the upgrade of existing products 

amortization of intangibles 



the sequential increases in amortization are due primarily to amortization of intangible assets acquired in recent acquisitions by coopersurgical the recent acquisition of soflex by coopervision in september 2016 and the acquisition of sauflon by coopervision in august 2014 the increase in coopervisions amortization expense in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 was also due to a charge of 23 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2016 to write off acquired inprocess research and development we expect amortization in fiscal 2017 to be approximately 146 million in each of the fiscal first through fourth quarters primarily due to intangible assets acquired through our acquisitions offset by intangible assets which we forecast to become fully amortized

restructuring and integration costs 

during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with the sauflon acquisition our coopervision business unit initiated restructuring and integration activities to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies the 2014 sauflon integration plan activities included workforce reductions consolidation of duplicative facilities and product rationalization as of october 31 2016 our activities related to this restructuring and integration plan were complete the total restructuring costs under this plan were 1483 million  as discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

in fiscal 2016 we recorded in cost of sales 564 million  of expense arising from productionrelated asset disposals accelerated depreciation on equipment and inventory rationalization primarily related to older lens products based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon we recorded in cost of sales 11 million  of employee termination costs we recorded in selling general and administrative expense a reduction of 11 million  due to a decrease in expected employee termination payments and we recorded 02 million  of expense for lease termination costs in addition coopervision incurred 100 million  of integration costs in fiscal 2016 included in operating expenses 

in fiscal 2015 we recorded in cost of sales 577 million  of expense arising from productionrelated asset disposals and accelerated depreciation on equipment primarily related to our hydrogel lenses based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon we recorded in cost of sales 40 million  of employee termination costs we recorded in selling general and administrative expense a reduction of 72 million  as a result of decreased estimates in expected employee termination costs and voluntary terminations and we recorded 04 million  of expense for lease termination costs we recorded in research and development expense 07 million  of employee termination costs in addition coopervision incurred 352 million  of integration costs in fiscal 2015 included in operating expenses see note 3 restructuring and integration costs for additional information 

we may from time to time decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods 

operating income 



the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the increase in consolidated net sales in addition the companys total operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2016 decreased by 3 compared to fiscal 2015 which had a corresponding increase in operating income as a percentage of sales the increase in coopervision operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to decreases in expenses relating to legal and restructuring and integration costs primarily related to sauflon as discussed above recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses in addition to the 170 million litigation settlement made in 2015 as discussed above coopersurgicals operating income increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to an increase in sales of higher margin legacy products as a result of our investment in sales and promotional activities to reach new customers as well as recently launched products partially offset by the sales of recently acquired lower margin products and services and the increase in total operating expenses 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the decrease in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the decrease in gross profit of 2 and the increase in operating expenses of 6 the decreases in consolidated and coopervision operating income in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the intellectual property settlement with jjvc along with restructuring integration and amortization costs primarily related to sauflon as discussed above recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses coopersurgicals operating income in fiscal 2015 decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the decrease in net sales of 5 

interest expense 



interest expense increased in absolute dollars in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with recent acquisitions interest expense increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with the august 2014 acquisition of sauflon as well as higher interest rates on our revolving credit agreement as such interest rates vary based on leverage total debt was 133 billion 135 billion and 138 billion at october 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively current period debt outstanding includes the 8300 million term loan entered on march 1 2016 2070 million of the 7000 million term loan entered into on august 4 2014 and 2850 million of the 3000 million term loan entered into on september 12 2013

provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 207 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 103 million in fiscal 2015 our effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income was 70 for fiscal 2016 48 for fiscal 2015 and 83 for fiscal 2014 the etr in fiscal 2016 increased in comparison to fiscal 2015 due to an increase in foreign nondeductible integration and transaction expenses partially offset by renewal of the rd tax credit and lower state income taxes the etr in fiscal 2015 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2014 partially due to discrete items and integration activities 

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our taxable income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income has decreased over recent fiscal years effectively lowering the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 812 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 35 in our fiscal year 2016 compared to 726 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 56 in our fiscal year 2015 the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2016 was 299 million and 90 million respectively compared to 329 million and 102 million respectively in fiscal 2015 as of october 31 2016 there was 727 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 113 million for stock options 523 million for restricted stock units and 91 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 35 years for nonvested stock options 32 years for restricted stock units and 17 years for performance shares net proceeds payments related to sharebased compensation awards for the fiscal years ended october 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were approximately 72 million  48 million  and 86 million  respectively 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2016 would have increased by approximately 350 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2016 would have increased by approximately 106 

we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjust the rate of expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

we grant performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers and other key employees if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions

of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if the goals are not achieved or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized

2016 highlights 

 comparative statistics 



working capital 

the increase in working capital at the end of fiscal 2016 from the end of fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the increase in cash balance generated from operations increases in accounts receivable and other current assets offset by decreases in inventories decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and net decrease in shortterm debt of 175 million 

the 20 million decrease in inventories was primarily related to decreases in inventories from sales and writeoffs of older products partially offset by increased production to support product launches of singleuse lenses including clariti and myday and acquired inventories from coopersurgical acquisitions our inventory months on hand moh were 56 and 62 at october 31 2016 and 2015 respectively our inventory moh after adjusting for product rationalization costs related to sauflon and facility startup costs were 67 at october 31 2016 representing a decrease from october 31 2015 of 75 that was adjusted for product rationalization costs related to sauflon and facility startup costs our days sales outstanding dso decreased to 53 days at october 31 2016 compared to 57 days at october 31 2015 primarily due to increased revenue and timing of collections 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of our foreign subsidiaries we presently intend to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment requirements

primarily for writeoff of property plant and equipment related to sauflon restructuring partially offset by 198 million related to excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities which primarily reflects the decrease in inventories of 122 million mainly due to product sales and older products rationalization excluding the increases related to recently acquired companies increase in accounts receivables and other assets of 35 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of 41 million and decrease in income tax payable of 89 million the 1187 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily due to the increase in net income favorable changes in working capital and the negative impact in fiscal 2015 due to the 170 million settlement with jjvc

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 



the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in fiscal 2016  and 2015  we performed qualitative assessments to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed 

  

initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of our goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense 

 

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on coopers common stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations to the extent reasonable and practical we may decide to reduce the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar our policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical transaction remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely a hypothetical 5 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities including the revolving credit agreement and term loans may vary with the federal funds rate and london interbank offered rate libor we may decrease this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt 

on march 1 2016 we entered into a new syndicated revolving credit and term loan agreement 2016 credit agreement with keybank as administrative agent the new agreement provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 10 billion and a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 8300 million the 2016 credit agreement replaced our previous credit agreement and funds from the new term loan were used to repay the 2000 million outstanding principal amount of the two uncommitted revolving lines of credit entered into on march 24 2015 and the outstanding amounts under the previous credit agreement we also used funds from the new term loan to partially repay outstanding amounts under the term loans entered into on august 4 2014 and september 12 2013 and for general corporate purposes at october 31 2016  we had 9998 million available under the revolving credit facility and 8300 million outstanding under the term loan 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

on august 4 2014 we entered into a threeyear 7000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on august 4 2017 there is no amortization of the principal and we may prepay the loan balances from time to time in whole or in part without premium or penalty at october 31 2016  2070 million remained outstanding on this term loan 

on september 12 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on september 12 2018 and will be subject to amortization of principal of 5 per year payable quarterly beginning october 31 2016 with the balance payable at maturity at october 31 2016  2850 million remained outstanding on this term loan 

see note 5 debt for additional information 



at october 31 2016  the scheduled maturities of our fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 



as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2016  it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2016  we had no interest rate swap outstanding if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about 111 million for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

silicone hydrogel  coopervisions silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products including clariti and myday products represented 55 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2015 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc 

over the past decade the contact lens industry has experienced a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses that now represent approximately 50 of the global contact lens market coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with our biofinity monthly spherical toric and multifocal lenses avaira ®  twoweek spherical and toric lenses clariti 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses and myday singleuse spherical lenses the clariti 1day and myday brands of singleuse contact lenses provides coopervision with the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market 

in the toric lens market a similar shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses has occurred but we believe that lens manufacturers also continue to compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners coopervision competes based on the fact that its three manufacturing processes including the clariti manufacturing platform recently acquired with sauflon allows a broad range of toric lens parameters which we believe provides wide choices for patient and practitioner and a high level of visual acuity we also compete based on our customer and professional services 

coopervisions primary competitors in the contact lens business have greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of our lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses based on the growth of the contact lens market over the past decade 

coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products used in the care and treatment of women the company participates in the womens healthcare market seeking to offer quality products innovative technologies and superior service to clinicians worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with clinicians to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to sophisticated instruments and equipment the result is a broad portfolio of products that are intended to aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that healthcare professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of womens health issues 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has established its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

coopersurgical competes in the global invitro fertilization ivf market with a product portfolio of ivf media and assisted reproductive technology solutions designed to enhance the work of fertility professionals to the benefit of families for the ivf market coopersurgical is focused on the objectives of internal growth and growth through acquisitions in august 2015 coopersurgical expanded its presence in the fertility market with the acquisition of reprogenetics a genetics laboratory specializing in preimplantation genetic screening pgs and preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd used during the ivf process 

market for womens healthcare 

coopersurgical participates in the market for womens healthcare with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of healthcare delivery hospitals and surgical centers obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to obgyns in the united states to increase over the next decade driving this growth is a steady number of reproductive age women with increasing fertility issues a large and stable middleaged population and a growing population of women over the age of 65 according to united states census estimates coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond office visit activity related to menopause including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade coopersurgical believes that past trends reflected women visiting clinicians primarily during their reproductive years with new treatment options now available and a more educated population coopersurgical expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later 

another trend in the market for womens healthcare includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and healthcare systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term 

the response in the united states market to the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act affordable care act or aca includes the development of new models of healthcare delivery one goal of these new models is to deliver more costeffective healthcare including a trend to move treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue in the near term 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for our medical devices 

some significant features of this market are

net sales of coopersurgical products used in office and surgical procedures represented 66 of coopersurgicals net sales in fiscal 2015 net sales of fertility products represented 34 of coopersurgicals net sales in fiscal 2015 

coopersurgical competition 

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the womens healthcare market supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians fertility clinics and hospitals coopersurgical competes based on our sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of our products coopersurgicals strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands its product line we also offer educational programs for medical professionals in the appropriate use of our products 

coopersurgical is seeking to expand our presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnsons ethicon endosurgery boston scientific olympus and covidien these competitors have wellestablished positions within the operating room environment coopersurgical intends to leverage our relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate our expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopersurgical also competes in the fertility category of the womens healthcare market we have broad product offerings for fertility evaluations and ivf procedures by obgyns reproductive endocrinologists and embryologists these include products for use by the obgyns in their offices for initial evaluations with office based hysteroscopy and first line treatments such as intrauterine insemination for use in fertility clinics our products include media micro tools and lab equipment and to improve ivf outcomes we offer testing services intended to increase implantation rates and decrease miscarriages 

coopersurgical intends to leverage our relationship with fertility clinics to expand our presence in the fertility market against competitors in the media and microtools categories that include vitrolife cook irvine scientific and life global and competitors in genetic testing that include genesis genetics good start genetics and igenomix 

research and development 

cooper employs approximately 215 people in our research and development and manufacturing engineering departments coopervision product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry clinical trials microbiology and biochemistry coopervisions research and development activities primarily include programs to develop new contact lens designs along with improving formulations and manufacturing processes 

coopersurgical conducts research and development inhouse and also has consulting agreements with external specialists coopersurgicals research and development activities include the design and improvement of surgical procedure devices the advancement and expansion of coopersurgicals portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings 

coopersponsored research and development expenditures represented 4 of net sales during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 and were 696 million 663 million and 588 million respectively during fiscal 2015 coopervision represented 79 percent and coopersurgical represented 21 percent of the total research and development expenses the same as fiscal 2014 we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs during fiscal 2013  2015 

government regulation 

medical device regulation 

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior notice to the fda requesting clearance for commercial distribution under section 510k of the fdca or premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be exempt from the premarket clearance or approval requirements or will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process rather than the pma process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device such as performance standards postmarket surveillance fda guidelines or particularized labeling requirements premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk such as lifesustaining lifesupporting or certain implantable devices or which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and other special controls such as those listed above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the pma process described below pma applications and supplemental pma applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution in the united states before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of pma applications the fda aims to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification but as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device the fda will not clear the device although many 510k premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data in some cases the fda requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence in reviewing a premarket notification the fda may request additional information including clinical data which may significantly prolong the review process 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process 

the fda may approve a pma application with postapproval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including among other things restrictions on labeling promotion sale and distribution and collection of longterm followup data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the approval new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans and the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweighs the risks t o human subjects from the proposed investigation that the testing protocol is scientifically sound and there is reason to believe that the device as proposed for use will be effective the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites there can be no assurance that submission of an ide will result in the ability to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

commence clinical trials additionally after a trial begins the fda may place it on hold or terminate it if among other reasons it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study during a study we are required to comply with the fdas ide requirements for investigator selection trial monitoring reporting record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them we are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda regulation 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include establishment registration and device listing with the fda the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing production control complaint handling documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling advertising and promotion new fda unique device identifier regulations that requires changes to labeling and packaging the physician payments sunshine act which requires the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include but may not be limited to any of the following sanctions or consequences warning letters or untitled letters fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension or shutdown of production refusing to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new or modified products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has cleared or approved a product in the united states the regulatory agencies in other countries must approve new products before they may be marketed there the time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance or approval and the requirements may differ there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the european union united states canada and various other industrialized countries japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements cooper also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws and laws pertaining to health information privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

the impact to our businesses of the affordable care act aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain the aca imposes a 23 percent excise tax with limited exceptions on any entity that manufactures or imports class i ii and iii medical devices offered for sale in the united states that began on january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense on our statement of income 

in addition the federal government as part of the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and healthcare professionals we are now required by law to report annually many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed healthcare professionals in addition certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could result in sanctions such as fines injunctions and civil penalties 

raw materials 

coopervisions raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb inc owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens healthcare market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and more recently at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations coopersurgical acquired reprogenetics in fiscal 2015 coopervision completed the acquisition of sauflon pharmaceuticals limited in fiscal 2014 and coopersurgical completed the acquisition of origio as in fiscal 2012 these acquisitions added significant operations to coopervision and coopersurgical respectively and greatly expanded their international businesses the acquisitions have correspondingly added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the healthcare industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical has not allocated substantial resources to new product development but rather it has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical has recently invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy coopervision invests in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features or “smart” contact lenses which incorporate electronics that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care and womens healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe over half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended october 31 2015 and 2014 were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

over the last few years in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth foreign countries in particular the euro zone have experienced recessionary pressures and face continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions and geopolitical issues concerns about the euro zone’s sovereign debt in recent years have caused uncertainty and disruption in the financial markets globally while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains as a result we may have lower than historical performance for market growth in fiscal 2016 

any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets continued volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets inflation deflation or other adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers it may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties integration difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico and hungary coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas malov denmark and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of west henrietta new york hampshire united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in trumbull connecticut and malov denmark any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to comply with qsr requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements or to respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things warning letters significant fines injunctions suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice for example some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by a sole supplier we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if our suppliers particularly those which are the sole source of any necessary material fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on proprietary technology which is unpatented it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision has faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims or legal claims relating to our service offerings including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand additionally we face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims including negligence relating to our provision of certain service offerings including our genetic testing services and their accuracy consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product or service that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls legal claims relating to our service offerings or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

we utilize complex computer systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we are just beginning a six year or more process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system at coopervision implementing a new erp system is not only costly but complex and difficult implementing a new erp system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our new erp system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts 

we attempt to protect our computer and communications systems but may experience interruptions and breaches including computer viruses malicious software cyberattacks and hacking” that could impair our ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with our customers or result in the theft of trade secrets or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise privacy of our sensitive information or that of our customers or other business partners 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products and services 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical devices design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion advertising and distribution as well as product import and export our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions fines warning letters suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all and significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products for example the fda recently has been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510k premarket clearance program in january 2011 the fda announced a plan of action that included twentyfive action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs some of the changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances for our products increase the cost of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for a modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

increased regulatory scrutiny and negative opinion of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals and potential decreased demand for our genetic testing services 

with our acquisition of reprogenetics in august 2015 we now offer certain genetic testing services to help identify the likelihood of pregnancy as well as identify possible disorders or diseases of a child prior to birth legislative proposals addressing oversight of genetic testing have been introduced in the united states and we expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time both in the united states and in foreign countries in the future we cannot provide any assurance that fda regulation or regulation by foreign regulatory authorities including premarket review will not be required for our genetic tests in the future or that other increased regulatory burdens will not be imposed on our genetic tests or any new genetic tests we may develop if premarket review is required our genetic test business will be negatively impacted until such review is completed and approval or clearance is obtained and the fda or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we stop selling our genetic tests pending premarket approval or clearance in addition to these regulatory burdens our ability to sell our genetic tests may be negatively impacted by public perception and social or cultural norms the information obtained from our genetic tests could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical legal and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information which in turn may result in increased regulation andor decreased demand 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow among other things design testing production control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within 10 working days after the recall is initiated recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act affordable care act the affordable care act makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the affordable care act of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members and any payments or other “transfers of value” to such owners manufacturers are required to submit reports to the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms by the 90 th day of each calendar year 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts at this time the full effect that the affordable care act would have on our business remains unclear for example the affordable care act imposes a new excise tax of 23 percent of the price for which certain medical devices are sold which went into effect on january 1 2013 coopervision is not affected by this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of a significant portion of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the affordable care act was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to the bipartisan budget act of 2015 will remain in effect until 2025 unless additional action is taken by congress on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers in addition on april 16 2015 president obama signed into law the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 or macra which among other things repealed the formula by which medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations 

we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal and state laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the americas recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 the final omnibus privacy security breach notification and enforcement rules omnibus final rule implementing hipaa and hitech became effective in september 2013 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under the hitech act and the omnibus final rule certain of hipaas privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act and the omnibus final rule set forth new notification requirements and standards for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions while there is no private right of action under hipaa that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for violations hipaa’s standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing individuals’ health information further varying state laws governing the use and disclosure of pii may be more restrictive than hipaa which means that entities subject to them must comply with the more restrictive state law in addition to complying with hipaa in some cases a breach may be required to be reported under state law and affected individuals notified even if the breach is not reportable or subject to breach notification requirements under hipaa state laws may impose separate fines and penalties upon violators and some unlike hipaa may afford a private right of action to state residents who believe their information has been misused 

  

with the possible exception of one our subsidiaries eye care prime llc which offers valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals which we believe has implemented adequate security measures we do not believe that we are a covered entity or a business associate under hipaa however many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information as defined by hipaa that we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liab 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

ility on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information if the government determines that we are a covered entity or a business associate we could be faced with additional costs related to hipaa compliance and subject to governmental enforcement for failure to comply with hipaa which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and reputation 

laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

indeed changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws these laws and regulations act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the recent affordable care act among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the affordable care act also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  and the results of our operations for fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation within the tables presented percentages are calculated based on the underlying wholedollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes 

outlook 

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by foreign currency volatility european debt concerns and the affordable care act including the trend of consolidation within the healthcare industry impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2016 

coopervision   we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform ®  technology and phosphorylcholine pc technology™ we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we introduce new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions 

on august 6 2014 we acquired sauflon pharmaceuticals limited sauflon a privatelyheld european manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions the acquisition of sauflon expanded our contact lens product portfolio particularly with sauflons clariti ®  1day brand of singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lenses 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials continue to grow and this product material represents about half of the industry our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability coopervision markets monthly and twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our biofinity ®  clariti ®  and avaira ®  brands and a monthly silicone hydrogel multifocal lens under biofinity coopervision markets singleuse spherical toric and multifocal lenses under our clariti 1day brand and a singleuse silicone hydrogel spherical lens under myday ®  

we believe that the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and our singleuse silicone hydrogel products represent an opportunity for our business our clariti 1day brand provides the only singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses in the marketplace with a complete line of spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses we forecast increasing aggregate demand for clariti 1day myday and proclear 1 day products as well as future singleuse products to meet this anticipated demand we plan to continue the implementation of capital projects to invest in increased singleuse manufacturing capacity

capital resources  at october 31 2015 we had 164 million in cash primarily outside the united states and 8908 million available under our revolving credit agreement the 7000 million term loan entered into on august 4 2014 and the 3000 million term loan entered into on september 12 2013 remain outstanding as of october 31 2015 on march 24 2015 we entered into two new uncommitted revolving lines of credit with a termination date of march 24 2016 and a maximum combined capacity of 2000 million at october 31 2015 all 2000 million was outstanding and the proceeds had been utilized to pay down higher interest rate debt on our revolving credit agreement 

on july 14 2015 coopervision made a onetime lump sum payment to jjvc of 170 million to settle our existing patent disputes as discussed in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the settlement was royaltyfree and neither party admitted any liability on april 7 2015 we paid all of the outstanding loan notes issued to previous holders of sauflon shares for the sauflon acquisition in the amount of 512 million that had been recorded in shortterm debt our current cash balance and availability under existing credit facilities reflects the use of cash outside the united states and the use of existing credit facilities to fund the 11 billion acquisition of sauflon in august 2014 we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and longterm cash requirements for capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and cash dividends however depending on the size or timing of these business activities we may seek to raise additional debt financing

coopervision net sales by geography 



coopervision fiscal 2015 net sales growth was partially offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations which decreased net sales by 1384 million americas net sales growth was primarily due to market gains of silicone hydrogel contact lenses including biofinity clariti and myday partially offset by a decrease in sales of older hydrogel lens products emea net sales growth was primarily driven by sales of clariti and myday silicone hydrogel lenses the increase in emea net sales was partially offset by the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar net sales to the asia pacific region decreased due to the negative impact from the weakening of foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen compared to the united states dollar excluding the impact of currency sales in the asia pacific region grew on market gains of silicone hydrogel lenses including biofinity clariti and myday along with growth in sales of proclear 1 day lenses 

coopervision’s net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold including recently introduced silicone hydrogel products and products from the acquisition of sauflon while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision’s sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth

the decrease in coopervisions gross margin in the three year period ending october 31 2015 was primarily attributable to negative effects of foreign currency changes product and equipment rationalization costs and facility startup costs foreign currency unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales due to the weakening of the foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar gross margin was negatively impacted by product and equipment charges and the related severance costs to rationalize products arising from our review of sauflons products materials and manufacturing processes in addition gross margin was negatively impacted by costs associated with the startup of new manufacturing facilities the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by the increase in sales of higher margin products including biofinity 

coopersurgicals gross margin remained flat primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin products offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency as we reported lower net sales partially due to the weakening of foreign currencies as compared to the united states dollar

selling general and administrative expense sga 



the increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to operating expenses of sauflon coopervisions sga also included approximately 245 million primarily for restructuring and integration costs largely made up of professional fees and personnel related costs for transitional employees related to sauflon restructuring and integration activities fiscal 2015 sga expenses also include 198 million of litigation settlement and legal costs of which 170 million relates to the settlement to intellectual property claims by jjvc as well as litigation costs relating to the class action complaints filed against coopervision and other contact lens manufacturers distributors and retailers relating to upp in addition to the restructuring and integration activities related to sauflon coopervision continues to invest in sales and marketing to promote our silicone hydrogel products including myday to reach new customers and support geographic expansion 

the increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to operating expenses of sauflon acquired in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and approximately 423 million of acquisition restructuring and integration costs largely made up of legal fees professional fees and severance costs expensed in fiscal 2014 

the decrease in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars is primarily due to efficiencies as a result of cost control measures partially offset by approximately 49 million primarily for integration costs in our fertility business and costs related to the acquisition of reprogenetics in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 the increase in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a percentage of net sales reflects the acquisition and acquisition costs along with lower net sales in the current year coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products and to reach new customers

the decrease in corporate sga in absolute dollars in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 is due to lower sharebased compensation costs primarily attributable to the timing of grants the growth in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs and acquisitionrelated professional service costs

research and development expense rd 



the sequential increases in coopervisions rd in absolute dollars over the fiscal years presented are primarily due to investments in new technologies clinical trials and increased headcount the increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily due to the inclusion of sauflon rd activities and 46 million in charges primarily for equipment rationalization and severance costs related to integration activities coopervision’s rd activities are primarily focused on the development of contact lenses and manufacturing improvements 

the sequential increases in coopersurgicals rd in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales over the fiscal years presented are primarily due to increased activity to bring newly acquired products to market increased investment in projects to develop new products and the upgrade of existing products coopersurgicals research and development activities include in vitro fertilization product development and the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices 

amortization of intangibles 



the sequential increases in amortization are due to acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions primarily the acquisitions of reprogenetics in august 2015 and sauflon in august 2014 we expect amortization in fiscal 2016 to be approximately 129 million in each of the fiscal first through third quarters and 120 million in the fiscal fourth quarter primarily due to intangible assets acquired with reprogenetics and sauflon offset by intangible assets which we forecast to become fully amortized 

divested operation 

on october 31 2013 we completed a transaction to sell aime our rigid gaspermeable contact lens and solutions business in japan to nippon contact lens inc the business was originally obtained as part of the december 1 2010 acquisition which included obtaining the rights to market biofinity in japan the divestiture was consistent with coopervision’s strategy to focus on its core soft contact lens business additionally aime revenue had declined in recent periods and the products had lower than average company margins 

we recorded a pretax loss of approximately 211 million in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2013 results from operations of aime are included in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2013 and we have not segregated the results of operations or net assets of aime on our financial statements for any period presented the disposition of the assets and liabilities of aime did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations as coopervision maintains continuing involvement through a distribution arrangement with aime for a minimum of three years post divestiture

restructuring costs 

during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with the sauflon acquisition our coopervision business unit initiated restructuring and integration activities to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies the 2014 sauflon integration plan activities include workforce reductions consolidation of duplicative facilities and product rationalization we estimate the total restructuring costs under this plan to be 1120 million  the increase over our prior estimates relates to additional product rationalization and related equipment disposals and accelerated depreciation primarily related to our hydrogel contact lenses based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon we expect to be substantially complete with activities related to operating expenses in our fiscal first quarter of 2016 and to incur costs related to manufacturing activities through the end of fiscal 2016 

pursuant to the 2014 sauflon integration plan in fiscal 2015 we recorded expenses in cost of sales of 577 million arising from productionrelated asset disposals and accelerated depreciation on equipment primarily related to our hydrogel lenses based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon we also recorded in cost of sales 40 million of employee termination costs we reduced the accrued employee termination costs in selling general and administrative expense by 72 million based on current estimates of the expected costs and the results of voluntary terminations we recorded in research and development expense 07 million of employee termination costs in fiscal 2015 we also recorded in selling general and administrative expense 04 million for lease termination costs we may from time to time decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

operating income 



the decrease in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to 2014 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the decrease in gross profit of 2 and the increase in operating expenses of 6 the decreases in consolidated and coopervision operating income in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the intellectual property settlement with jjvc along with restructuring integration and amortization costs primarily related to sauflon as discussed above recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses coopersurgicals operating income in fiscal 2015 decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the decrease in net sales of 5 

the consolidated operating income in fiscal 2014 remained flat as compared to fiscal 2013 in absolute dollars primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 6 offset by the increase in operating expenses of 9 the decreases in consolidated and coopervision operating income as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was due to the acquisition restructuring and integration costs primarily related to sauflon as discussed above recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses coopersurgicals operating income in fiscal 2014 increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales due to the increase of gross profit of 2 and decrease of total operating expense of 3

interest expense increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with the august 2014 acquisition of sauflon as well a higher interest rates on our revolving credit agreement as such interest rates vary based on leverage the decrease in interest expense in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 reflects lower average debt and lower average interest rates during the year total debt was 135 billion 138 billion and 03 billion at october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively current period debt outstanding includes 2000 million on two uncommitted revolving lines of credit entered into on march 24 2015 the 7000 million term loan entered into on august 4 2014 the 3000 million term loan entered into on september 12 2013 as well as about 1092 million drawn on our revolving credit agreement 

insurance proceeds 

on october 28 2011 a manufacturing building in the united kingdom experienced an incident in which a pipe broke in our fire suppression system causing water and fire retardant foam damage to the facility while this incident did not substantially impact our existing customers the repairs to the facility and resultant decrease in manufacturing capacity impacted the timing of marketing initiatives to generate additional sales in january 2013 we resolved our business interruption claim with our insurer for a total of 191  million we received payments of 50  million in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 in our fiscal first quarter of 2013 we recorded the remaining 141  million in our consolidated statement of income of which we received payment of 29  million during the fiscal first quarter of 2013 and payment of the remaining 112  million in the fiscal second quarter of 2013

provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 103 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 247 million in fiscal 2014 our effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income was 48 for fiscal 2015 83 for fiscal 2014 and 49 for fiscal 2013 the etr in fiscal 2015 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2014 partially due to discrete items and integration activities the etr in fiscal 2014 increased in comparison to fiscal 2013 to reflect the inclusion in the fiscal 2013 etr of several discrete items causing a reduction in that year these items related primarily to the statutory income tax rate reduction in the united kingdom and the renewal of the rd tax credit in the united states 

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our taxable income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income has decreased over recent fiscal years effectively lowering the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 726 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 56 in our fiscal year 2015 compared to 855 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 26 in our fiscal year 2014 the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates as compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

share repurchases 

in december 2011 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program and subsequently amended the total repurchase authorization to 5000 million the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time during fiscal 2015 we repurchased 468 thousand shares of our common stock for 673 million at an average purchase price of 13960 per share during fiscal 2014 we repurchased 572 thousand shares of our common stock for 758 million at an average purchase price of 13249 per share at october 31 2015 we had remaining authorization to repurchase about 1184 million of our common stock see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2015 was 329 million and 102 million respectively compared to 365 million and 117 million respectively in fiscal 2014 as of october 31 2015 there was 622 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 50 million for stock options 488 million for restricted stock units and 84 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 29 years for nonvested stock options 34 years for restricted stock units and 17 years for performance shares net payments proceeds related to sharebased compensation awards for the fiscal years ended october 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were approximately 48 million  86 million  and 193 million  respectively 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2015 would have increased by approximately 450 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2015 would have increased by approximately 130 

we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjust the rate of expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

we grant performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers and other key employees if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if the goals are not achieved or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized

capital resources and liquidity 

2015 highlights 

 comparative statistics 



working capital 

the decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2015 from the end of fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the increase in short term debt from the 2000 million in new revolving lines of credit borrowed in the fiscal second quarter of 2015 and utilized to pay down higher interest rate debt on our long term revolving credit agreement working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 includes 551 million of loan notes issued related to the acquisition of sauflon which was paid in fiscal 2015 the decrease in working capital was also due to the decrease in cash offset by the increases in inventories accounts receivable and other current assets along with the decrease in accounts payable 

the 382 million increase in inventories was primarily related to increased production to support product launches of singleuse lenses including clariti and myday our singleuse silicone hydrogel contact lenses our inventory months on hand moh were 75 at october 31 2015 after adjusting for product rationalization costs related to the acquisition of sauflon and facility startup costs this represents an increase from moh at october 31 2014 of 66 that were adjusted for product rationalization costs related to the acquisition of sauflon our unadjusted inventory moh was 62 and 61 at october 31 2015 and 2014 respectively our days sales outstanding dso increased to 57 days at october 31 2015 compared to 53 days at october 31 2014 as trade accounts receivable increased by 66 million primarily due to timing of collections 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of our foreign subsidiaries we presently intend to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment requirements 

operating cash flow 

cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 continued to be our major source of liquidity at 3910 million compared to 4548 million in fiscal 2014 and 4159 million in fiscal 2013 fiscal 2015 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

results include 2051 million of net income and noncash items primarily made up of 1914 million related to depreciation and amortization 329 million of expense and 173 million of excess tax benefits both related to sharebased compensation 103 million related to net gains in currency translation 424 million related to loss on retirement of property plant and equipment results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities which primarily reflect the increases in inventories and other assets of 468 million the increases in trade and other receivables of 73 million and the increase of 12 million relating to taxes the 639 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily due to the decrease in net income the 170 million settlement with jjvc in the fiscal third quarter of 2015 and unfavorable changes in working capital 

for fiscal 2015 our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of 140 million for interest and 170 million settlement with jjvc 

for fiscal 2014 our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of 41 million for interest

cash used in investing activities of 13464 million in fiscal 2014 was for payments of 11097 million related to acquisitions primarily the acquisition of sauflon and capital expenditures of 2381 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity partially offset by the 14 million insurance recovery related to facility repairs 

financing cash flow 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as share repurchases and sharebased compensation awards cash used in financing activities of 1067 million in fiscal 2015 was driven by 673 million in payments for share repurchases under our existing share repurchase plan 373 million from net repayments of debt 81 million for purchases of noncontrolling interests net payments of 48 million related to vested sharebased compensation awards a 32 million payment for contingent consideration 29 million for dividends and distributions of 11 million to noncontrolling interests cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 173 million in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation awards and 07 million of proceeds from a construction allowance net repayment of debt in the period includes the payment of 512 million to settle all the outstanding loan notes issued for the sauflon acquisition 

in fiscal 2014 the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily related to borrowings and payments of debt as well as share repurchases and sharebased compensation awards cash provided by financing activities of 8422 million in fiscal 2014 was driven by 8879 million from net borrowings of debt 193 million in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation awards 122 million of proceeds from a construction allowance and 86 million of proceeds from exercise of sharebased compensation awards cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by 758 million in payments for share repurchases under our share repurchase plan a 38 million payment for contingent consideration 29

the expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2025 are disclosed in note 10 employee benefits 

  

we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions therefore about 284 million of our longterm income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above however other longterm liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet include these uncertain tax positions see note 6 for additional information

accounting pronouncements issued and not yet adopted 

in april 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201503 interest  imputation of interest subtopic 83530 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts we do not anticipate the adoption of these amendments which are effective for the company for the fiscal year beginning on november 1 2016 will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  asu 201409 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu 201409 sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract identifying the performance obligations determining the transaction price allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations the amendments in the asu can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures we are currently evaluating the impact of asu 201409 which is effective for the company in our fiscal year beginning on november 1 2018 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

on november 1 2014 we adopted asu 201311 income taxes topic 740 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists asu 201311 requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available or the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets the adoption of asu 201311 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

 in fiscal 2015 and 2014 we performed qualitative assessments to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill we may have to recognize a noncash impairment of our goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense 

 

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on coopers common stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations to the extent reasonable and practical we may decide to reduce the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations on the underlying exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar our policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical transaction remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely a hypothetical 5 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities including the revolving credit agreement and term loans may vary with the london interbank offered rate libor we may decrease this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt 

on march 24 2015 we entered into two uncommitted line of credit agreements that have termination dates of march 24 2016 and provide revolving loan amounts of up to 1000 million each with maturity dates of up to ninety days from the loan origination date at october 31 2015 2000 million was outstanding under these facilities 

on august 4 2014 we entered into a threeyear 7000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on august 4 2017 there is no amortization of the principal and we may prepay the loan balances from time to time in whole or in part without premium or penalty at october 31 2015 7000 million remained outstanding on this term loan 

on september 12 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on september 12 2018 and will be subject to amortization of principal of 5 per year payable quarterly beginning october 31 2016 with the balance payable at maturity at october 31 2015 3000 million remained outstanding on this term loan 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

on may 31 2012 we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement originally entered into on january 12 2011 the aggregate revolving commitment is 10 billion with a maturity date of may 31 2017 and we have the ability to increase the facility by up to an additional 5000 million at october 31 2015 we had 8908 million available under the revolving credit agreement 



at october 31 2015  the scheduled maturities of our fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 



as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2015  it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2015  we had no interest rate swap outstanding if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about 111 million for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 

coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured

efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding we also believe that the manufacturing processes acquired in connection with the sauflon acquisition will be of value to us as these new platforms and processes may add greater flexibility and reduce time to market of our combined product offerings this increased manufacturing flexibility should allow coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses we believe our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability silicone hydrogel lenses now represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity® brand is coopervisions leading product line under the biofinity brand coopervision markets monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products coopervision has also launched twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our avaira® brand in fiscal 2013 we launched myday tm  our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens in europe 

we believe that the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow that competitive silicone hydrogel singleuse lens products are gaining market share and that they represent a risk to our business to meet this anticipated demand we plan to launch myday in more geographical regions such as the united states during fiscal 2015 and to continue the implementation of capital projects to invest in increased singleuse manufacturing capacity 

consistent with this strategy on august 6 2014 we completed the acquisition of sauflon pharmaceuticals limited sauflon a privatelyheld european manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions the acquisition of sauflon expands our contact lens product portfolio particularly with sauflons clariti® 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal silicone hydrogel lenses clariti lenses received united states fda clearance in august 2013 sauflon is headquartered in the united kingdom and has a global presence with manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and hungary the sauflon acquisition is intended to accelerate the growth of sales of our singleuse products by enabling a multitier singleuse strategy with a full suite of hydrogel and silicone hydrogel product offerings in the major product categories of sphere toric and multifocal lenses this acquisition is also intended to provide for an enhanced relationship with key european retailers and opportunities for operational synergies 

in addition coopervision lenses compete based on providing superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology coopervision lenses have a round to partial round edge which we believe increases comfort coopervisions proclear® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a material that incorporates phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim … may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear

in addition to its pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with our traditional hydrogel products 

contact lens product sales 

spheres net sales of coopervisions spherical lenses represented 56 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2014 including net sales of singleuse spherical lens that represented 22 percent of net sales in the fiscal year 

toric and multifocal net sales of coopervisions toric lenses represented 31 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2014 net sales of multifocal lenses represented 11 percent of net sales in the fiscal year 

proclear net sales of coopervisions pc technology products  which consist of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics® xc and proclear® 1 day  represented 24 percent of coopervisions net sales in fiscal 2014 

silicone hydrogel  coopervisions silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products including sauflons clariti lenses in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and not in fiscal 2013 represented 49 percent of coopervisions net sales as compared to 43 percent in fiscal 2013 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc 

over the past decade the contact lens industry has experienced a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses that now represent approximately 50 of the global contact lens market coopervisions primary competitors control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market coopervision competes in the silicone hydrogel segment of the market with our biofinity monthly spherical toric and multifocal lenses avaira twoweek spherical and toric lenses and myday singleuse spherical lenses we believe that the addition of sauflons clariti 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal lenses provides coopervision with the broadest product portfolio in the singleuse silicone hydrogel market 

in the toric lens market a similar shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses has occurred but we believe that lens manufacturers also continue to compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners coopervision competes based on its three manufacturing processes including manufacturing processes recently acquired with sauflon yielding wider ranges of toric lens parameters providing wide choices for patient and practitioner and superior visual acuity as well as by offering excellent customer service including high standards of ontime product delivery 

coopervisions primary competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the companys lens products 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that its contact lenses will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses and there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses 

coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products used in the care and treatment of women the company participates in the womens healthcare market through offering quality products innovative technologies and superior service to clinicians worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with clinicians to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to sophisticated instruments and equipment the result is a broad portfolio of products that aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that healthcare professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of womens health issues 

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

coopersurgical competes in the global invitro fertilization ivf market with a product portfolio of ivf media and assisted reproductive technology art solutions that enhance the work of fertility professionals to the benefit of families in july 2012 coopersurgical acquired origio to form a combined medical device company that develops manufactures and distributes highly specialized products that target ivf treatment with a goal to make fertility treatment safer more efficient and convenient 

market for womens healthcare 

coopersurgical participates in the market for womens healthcare with its diversified product lines in three major categories based on the point of healthcare delivery hospitals and surgical centers obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

coopersurgical expects patient visits to obgyns in the united states to increase over the next decade driving this growth is a steady number of reproductive age women with increasing fertility issues a large and stable middleaged population and a growing population of women over the age of 65 according the united states census estimates coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond office visit activity related to menopausal problems including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade coopersurgical believes that in the past clinicians primarily saw women only during their reproductive years now with new treatment options available and a more educated population coopersurgical expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later 

another trend in the market for womens healthcare includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and healthcare systems this trend includes the increasing influence of supply chain controls such as value analysis committees on product evaluation and procurement coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term 

the response in the united states market to the affordable care act aca includes the development of new models of healthcare delivery one goal of these new models is to deliver more costeffective healthcare including a trend to move treatment out of hospitals and surgery centers and into the office setting without compromising care we expect this trend to continue in the near term 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for coopersugicals medical devices 

some significant features of this market are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

womans healthcare product sales 

net sales of coopersurgical products used in office and surgical procedures representing 65 of coopersurgicals net sales decreased 1 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 net sales of fertility products representing 35 of coopersurgicals net sales grew 7 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 

coopersurgical competition 

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the womens healthcare market supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians fertility clinics and hospitals coopersurgical competes based on our sales and marketing expertise and the technological 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

advantages of our products coopersurgicals strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands our product line we also offer educational programs for medical professionals in the appropriate use of our products 

coopersurgical is seeking to expand our presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnsons ethicon endosurgery boston scientific gyrus acmi and covidien these competitors have wellestablished positions within the operating room environment coopersurgical intends to leverage our relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate our expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

research and development 

cooper employs about 250 people in our research and development and manufacturing engineering departments most of these employees are in coopervision coopervision product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry clinical trials microbiology and biochemistry coopervisions research and development activities primarily include programs to develop new contact lens designs along with improving formulations and manufacturing processes 

coopersurgical conducts research and development inhouse and also has consulting agreements with external specialists coopersurgicals research and development activities include the design and improvement of surgical procedure devices the advancement and expansion of coopersurgicals portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings 

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were 663 million 588 million and 517 million respectively research and development expenditures represented 4 percent of net sales in fiscal 2012  2014 during fiscal 2014 coopervision represented 79 percent and coopersurgical represented 21 percent of the total research and development expenses the same as fiscal 2013 we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs during fiscal 2012  2014 

government regulation 

medical device regulation 

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans outweighs the risks and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda regulation 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling new fda unique device identifier legislation that requires changes to labeling and packaging the physician payments sunshine act which requires the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion can result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there the worldwide medical device regulations are increasing with many countries becoming regulated for the first time for example hong kong and singapore are now regulated and following the global harmonization task force model for regulating medical devices these emerging regulated countries require the same rigorous safety data compiled in preclinical and clinical studies for the rest of the world japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements cooper also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws and laws pertaining to healthcare privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

the impact to our businesses of the united states’ patient protection and affordable care act affordable care act or aca provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system changes remains uncertain the aca imposes a 23 percent excise tax with limited exceptions on any entity that manufactures or imports class i ii and iii medical devices offered for sale in the united states that began on january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense on the statement of income 

in addition the federal government as part of the aca as well as certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device companies and healthcare professionals we are now required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to licensed healthcare professionals in addition certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws failure to adhere to our policies comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could result in sanctions such as fines injunctions and civil penalties 

raw materials 

coopervisions raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets our products in the united states through our field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision augments our united states sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing social media and advertising in professional journals in the emea and asia pacific regions coopervision primarily markets our products through our field sales representatives in other countries coopervision uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market our products within specific geographic areas 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors in the united states coopersurgical augments our sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows professional educational programs and internet promotions including e‑commerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals fertility products are marketed globally through our field sales representatives and distributors

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to our overall business the names of certain of coopers products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect our intellectual property rights aggressively 

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of our principal business units other than our license agreement effective as of november 19 2007 between coopervision and ciba vision ag and ciba vision corporation this license relates to patents covering coopervisions silicone hydrogel contact lens products our royalty obligations under this license agreement extend until the expiration of the applicable patent rights which we believe occurred in september 2014 in the united states and we believe will occur in march 2016 outside of the united states 

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses we own certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

dependence on customers 

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 

government contracts 

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

backlog 

backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers business units 

seasonality 

coopervisions contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

compliance with environmental laws 

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb inc owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future for example with increased product entries from asia pacific contact lens manufacturers or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens healthcare market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical and more recently at coopervision we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations in fiscal 2014 coopervision completed the acquisition of sauflon pharmaceuticals limited and in fiscal 2012 coopersurgical completed the acquisition of origio as these acquisitions added significant operations to coopervision and coopersurgical respectively and greatly expanded their international businesses the acquisitions have correspondingly added risks we could face with respect to acquisitions and include 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the healthcare industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical has not allocated substantial resources to new product development but rather it has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopersurgical has recently invested in expanding the internal research and development function with the goal of organizational growth and to complement our acquisitions strategy coopervision has been investing in new product development since 2005 including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses research and development time commitments higher feasibility risk with longer term projects the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits in addition we have been slower to introduce new silicone hydrogel contact lens products than our competitors which put these products at a competitive disadvantage the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care and womens healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations for coopervision and our newly acquired sauflon and origio businesses are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately twothirds of our net sales for coopervision for the fiscal years ended october 31 2014 and 2013 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as the growing us deficit high energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market foreign countries in particular the euro zone are affected by similar systemic impacts as a result we continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in fiscal 2015 

continued turbulence particularly in international markets and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico through the sauflon acquisition coopervision acquired manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and hungary coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas malov denmark and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of west henrietta new york hampshire united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in trumbull connecticut and malov denmark any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a cgmp qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice for example some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity avaira and clariti are supplied by a sole supplier we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if our suppliers particularly those which are the sole source of any necessary material fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on unpatented proprietary technology or technology where patents will expire in less than a few years it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision has faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

we manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

we utilize complex computer systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

we attempt to protect our computer and communications systems but may experience interruptions and breaches including computer viruses malicious software cyberattacks and hacking” that could impair our ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with our customers or result in the theft of trade secrets or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise privacy of our sensitive information or that of our customers or other business partners 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical devices design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example the upcoming fda unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda and foreign jurisdictions may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products for example the fda recently has been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510k program in january 2011 the fda announced a plan of action that included twentyfive action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs some of these changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances for our products increase the cost of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found for example coopervision recently concluded a recall of limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses and avaira sphere contact lenses recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act which we refer to collectively as the health care reform law the health care reform law makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the health care reform law of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts at this time the full effect that the health care reform law would have on our business remains unclear for example the health care reform law imposes a new excise tax of 23 percent of the price for which certain medical devices are sold which went into effect on january 1 2013 coopervision is not affected by this tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of almost all of coopersurgicals products are subject to this tax 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the health care reform law was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the americas recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under the hitech act certain of hipaas privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions 

  

while with the possible exception of limited valueadded software solutions for eye care professionals which we believe are hipaa compliant we do not believe that we are a covered entity or a business associate under hipaa many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information as defined by hipaa that we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information pursuant to the hitech act if the government determines that we are a business associate we could be additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements in addition the final omnibus rule released in january 2013 among other things modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that will likely make more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and new legal and regulatory requirements and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations to the extent hipaa is applicable to certain ancillary practice management software services offered to eye care professionals we believe those offerings are hipaa compliant 

laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

indeed changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws the advanced medical technology association advamed a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers has also released a revised code of ethics outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals this code became effective july 1 2009 these laws regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the recent health care reform law among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the health care reform law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

note numbers refer to “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

results of operations 

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  and the results of our operations for fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

outlook 

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by united states and european debt concerns the affordable care act including the trend of consolidation within the healthcare industry and the economic downturn in japan together with foreign currency volatility particularly the yen euro and the pound impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2015 

coopervision   we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform ®  technology and phosphorylcholine technology pc technology™ we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we introduce new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our desired future levels of sales growth and profitability coopervision markets monthly and twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our biofinity ®  and avaira ®  brands a monthly multifocal silicone hydrogel lens under biofinity and a singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens under myday tm  

we believe that the global market for singleuse contact lenses will continue to grow and that competitive silicone hydrogel singleuse products are gaining market share and that they represent a risk to our business we compete with myday our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens and our proclear 1 day products including proclear ® 1 day multifocal we forecast increasing demand for our existing and future singleuse products to meet this anticipated demand in fiscal 2015 we plan to continue the implementation of capital projects to invest in increased singleuse manufacturing capacity 

consistent with this strategy on august 6 2014 we acquired sauflon pharmaceuticals limited sauflon a privatelyheld european manufacturer and distributor of soft contact lenses and aftercare solutions the acquisition of sauflon expands our contact lens product portfolio particularly with sauflons clariti® 1day brand of singleuse sphere toric and multifocal silicone hydrogel lenses clariti lenses received united states fda clearance in august 2013 sauflon is headquartered in the united kingdom and has a global presence with manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom and hungary 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we paid approximately 11311 million for sauflon consisting of approximately 10732 million in cash and approximately 580 million in the form of loan notes we financed the acquisition with available offshore cash and credit facilities along with funds from the new 7000 million term loan facility described below and in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are in the process of determining the purchase price allocation for this acquisition which is described in more detail in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the sauflon acquisition is intended to accelerate the growth in sales of our singleuse products by enabling a multitier singleuse strategy with a full suite of hydrogel and silicone hydrogel product offerings in the major product categories of sphere toric and multifocal lenses this acquisition is also intended to provide for enhanced relationships with key european retailers and opportunities for operational synergies 

coopersurgical   our coopersurgical business competes in the highly fragmented medical device segment of the womens healthcare market coopersurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies and products that complement its business model in october 2014 coopersurgical acquired endosee corporation a developer of an officebased disposable hysteroscopy system that has fda clearance we paid 440 million for endosee and expect the acquisition to be neutral to earnings per share excluding acquisition costs and related amortization we intend to continue to invest in coopersurgicals business through acquisitions of companies and product lines coopersurgical product sales are categorized based on the point of healthcare delivery including products used in medical office and surgical procedures by obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns that represented 65 of coopersurgicals net sales in fiscal 2014 coopersurgicals remaining sales are products used in fertility clinics that now represent 35 of coopersurgicals net sales compared to 33 in fiscal 2013 

capital resources  on august 4 2014 we entered into a threeyear 7000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement by and among the company the lenders party thereto and keybank national association as administrative agent this syndicated credit facility will mature and the balance is payable on august 4 2017 there is no amortization of principal and we may prepay loan balances from time to time in whole or in part without premium or penalty we utilized this facility to fund the acquisition of sauflon pharmaceuticals limited as well as to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 

at october 31 2014 we had 252 million in cash primarily outside the united states and 7203 million available under our existing revolving credit agreement the 7000 million term loan entered into on august 4 2014 and the 3000 million term loan entered into on september 12 2013 remain outstanding as of october 31 2014 in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 we completed the acquisition of sauflon for 113 billion discussed above looking forward our cash and availability under existing credit facilities will be reduced due to the use of cash outside the united states and the use of existing credit facilities to fund the acquisition of sauflon we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities including the august 4 2014 7000 million term loan will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and longterm cash requirements for capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and cash dividends however depending on the size or timing of these business activities we may seek to raise additional debt financing

highlights 2014 vs 2013 

 

fiscal 2014 pretax results include 357 million for amortization of intangible assets and 628 million of acquisition integration and restructuring costs primarily related to the acquisition of sauflon we expect amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods however the amounts are affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions expenses such as the acquisition related and integration expenses generally diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions however we generally will incur similar expenses in connection with any future acquisitions we incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations many of these costs relate to our acquisition of sauflon in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 acquisition related and integration expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional employees other acquired employee related costs and integration related professional services restructuring expenses consist of employee severance product rationalization facility and other exit costs 

the fiscal 2014 integration and restructuring costs include 165 million in charges to cost of sales primarily for product rationalization arising from the acquisition of sauflon the charge for product rationalization is based on our review of products materials and manufacturing processes of sauflon included in our selling general and administrative expense sga is 445 million in costs for coopervisions acquisition of sauflon and the related integration and restructuring activities severance costs in our coopersurgical fertility business along with other acquisition costs research and development expense includes 06 million of severance costs related to integration and restructuring activities

coopervision net sales by geography 



coopervision’s worldwide net sales grew 10 in the yeartoyear comparison including sauflon as discussed above americas net sales grew 7 primarily due to market gains of coopervision’s silicone hydrogel contact lenses along with singleuse sphere and multifocal products emea net sales increased 22 primarily driven by increased sales of silicone hydrogel lenses including sauflons silicone hydrogel singleuse products net sales to the asia pacific region decreased 3 due to the negative impact of the weakening of the japanese yen compared to the united states dollar excluding the impact of currency sales in the asia pacific region grew on market gains of silicone hydrogel lenses and singleuse products including proclear multifocal singleuse lenses 

coopervision’s net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold including recently introduced silicone hydrogel products and products from the acquisition of sauflon while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision’s sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth

coopersurgical net sales 

coopersurgical participates in the market for womens healthcare with its diversified product lines used in fertility procedures and by gynecologists and obstetricians in surgical procedures and in the medical office with the july 2012 acquisition of origio as a global invitro fertilization ivf medical device company coopersurgical develops manufactures and distributes highly specialized products that target ivf treatment with a goal to make fertility treatment safer more efficient and convenient 



coopersurgicals net sales of fertility products increased primarily due to market gains of disposable products partially offset by slower growth in sales of medical equipment the decline in net sales of medical office and surgical procedures by obgyns was primarily due to declines in sales of medical equipment offset in part by growth in sales of disposable products 

coopersurgical’s sales primarily comprise women’s healthcare products used in fertility procedures and by gynecologists and obstetricians in surgical procedures and in the medical office the balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare which coopersurgical does not actively market unit growth and product mix primarily sales of fertility products along with increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced sales growth

2014 compared to 2013 and 2013 compared to 2012 

cost of salesgross profit 



the decrease in coopervisions gross margin was primarily attributable to acquisitionrelated items startup costs of myday our singleuse silicone hydrogel contact lens and the effects of foreign currency changes sales of lower gross margin products from the august 2014 acquisition of sauflon represented 4 of net sales in the year and we expect sauflon gross margin to be about midfifty percent in the near term gross margin was negatively impacted by inventory and equipment charges to rationalize products primarily our avaira toric contact lenses based on our review of sauflons products materials and manufacturing processes gross margin was also impacted by startup costs of myday as this new product has only recently achieved low doubledigit gross margin that includes the impact of building new manufacturing capacity foreign currency unfavorably impacted gross margin as we reported lower net sales on products sold in japan due to the weakening of the japanese yen as compared to the united states dollar particularly in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 the decreases in gross margin were partially offset by the increase in sales of higher margin biofinity products and the favorable impact on gross margin due to the divestiture of aime in october 2013 

coopersurgicals gross margin remained flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to favorable product mix offset by restructuring costs in the fertility business a greater percentage of our sales were higher margin disposable products and the percentage of lower margin equipment sales within fertility products declined as well 

selling general and administrative expense sga 



consolidated sga increased to 40 of net sales in fiscal 2014 from 38 of net sales in fiscal 2013 and 39 of net sales in fiscal 2012 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to operating expenses of sauflon and approximately 423 million of acquisition restructuring and integration costs largely made up of legal fees professional fees and severance costs expensed in fiscal 2014 in addition to the acquisition and integration activities related to sauflon coopervision continues to invest in sales and marketing to promote our silicone hydrogel products including myday to reach new customers and support geographic expansion 

the 3 increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 in absolute dollars is primarily due to our investment in sales and marketing including increased headcount to reach new customers and support geographic expansion programs included the promotion of our silicone hydrogel products including myday our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens and proclear 1 day multifocal in japan 

the decrease in coopersurgicals sga in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to efficiencies as a result of cost control measures in fiscal 2014 and costs included in fiscal 2013 for acquisition and integration activities related to origio coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products with emphasis on products used in surgical procedures and to reach new customers the medical excise tax that became effective on january 1 2013 on sales of coopersurgicals products in the united states was 29 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 24 million in fiscal 2013 

the 27 increase in coopersurgicals sga in absolute dollars in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and the increase as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to operating expenses related to origio including approximately 06 million of acquisition costs in fiscal 2013 

corporate headquarters’ sga increased 17 in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs and acquisitionrelated professional service costs the 15 growth in absolute dollars in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs 

research and development expense rd 



the sequential increases in coopervisions rd in absolute dollars over the fiscal years presented are primarily due to investments in new technologies clinical trials and increased headcount coopervision’s rd activities are primarily focused on the development of new contact lens designs and now include sauflons rd activities related to product and manufacturing improvements and new contact lens designs 

the sequential increases in coopersurgicals rd in absolute dollars over the fiscal years presented include the shift toward investment in projects to develop new products along with the upgrade of existing products coopersurgicals research and development activities include invitro fertilization product development and the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices 

divested operation 

on october 31 2013 we completed a transaction to sell aime our rigid gaspermeable contact lens and solutions business in japan to nippon contact lens inc the business was originally obtained as part of the december 1 2010 acquisition which included obtaining the rights to market biofinity in japan the divestiture was consistent with coopervision’s strategy to focus on its core soft contact lens business 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

additionally aime revenue had declined in recent periods and the products had lower than average company margins 

we recorded a pretax loss of approximately 211 million in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2013 results from operations of aime are included in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2013 and 2012 and we have not segregated the results of operations or net assets of aime on our financial statements for any period presented the disposition of the assets and liabilities of aime did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations as coopervision maintains continuing involvement through a distribution arrangement with aime for a minimum of three years post divestiture 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles was 357 million in fiscal 2014 302 million in fiscal 2013 and 240 million in fiscal 2012 the 18 increase in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and the 26 increase in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 were primarily due to intangible assets from acquisitions primarily the acquisition of sauflon in august 2014 and origio in july 2012 we expect amortization in fiscal 2015 to be approximately 137 million in the fiscal first quarter and 128 million in each of the fiscal second through fourth quarters primarily due to intangible assets acquired with sauflon offset by intangible assets related to acquired technology which will become fully amortized 

settlements 

on december 2 2011 coopervision and rembrandt vision technologies lp entered into a settlement agreement under which coopervision agreed to make a lump sum payment of 100 million to rembrandt and rembrandt executed a covenant not to sue regarding patent infringement claims we recorded a charge in selling general and administrative expense for the settlement in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 

operating income 

operating income grew about 06 million in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 and increased 225 million or 8 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 



the consolidated operating income in fiscal 2014 remained flat as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 6 offset by the increase in operating expenses of 9 the decreases in consolidated and coopervision operating income as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was due to the acquisition restructuring and integration costs primarily related to sauflon discussed above recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses coopersurgicals operating income in fiscal 2014 increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales due to the increase of gross profit of 2 and decrease of total operating expense of 3 

the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 in absolute dollars was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 11 partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of 13 the decrease in consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the 211 million loss on divestiture of aime discussed above recorded in operating expenses for coopervision

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 13 to 80 million in fiscal 2014 representing 05 of net sales in fiscal 2014 as compared to 06 of net sales in fiscal 2013 the fiscal 2014 decrease reflects lower average debt and lower average interest rates in the current fiscal year we expect to have higher interest expense in the near term on higher average debt as a result of debt incurred in connection with the august 2014 acquisition of sauflon the 7000 million term loan entered into on august 4 2014 and discussed above the 3000 million term loan entered into on september 12 2013 as well as about 2797 million drawn on our existing revolving credit agreement were outstanding as of october 31 2014 compared to 3002 million in debt outstanding as of october 31 2013 

interest expense decreased 22 to 92 million in fiscal 2013 constituting 06 of net sales in fiscal 2013 as compared to 08 of net sales in fiscal 2012 the fiscal 2013 decrease reflects lower average debt and lower average interest rates 

insurance proceeds 

on october 28 2011 a manufacturing building in the united kingdom experienced an incident in which a pipe broke in our fire suppression system causing water and fire retardant foam damage to the facility while this incident did not substantially impact our existing customers the repairs to the facility and resultant decrease in manufacturing capacity impacted the timing of marketing initiatives to generate additional sales in january 2013 we resolved our business interruption claim with our insurer for a total of 191  million we received payments of 50  million in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 in our fiscal first quarter of 2013 we recorded the remaining 141  million in our consolidated statement of income of which we received payment of 29  million during the fiscal first quarter of 2013 and payment of the remaining 112  million in the fiscal second quarter of 2013 

losses on extinguishment of debt 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded a 14 million loss related to the amendment to our revolving credit agreement on may 31 2012 

other expense income net 



the fiscal 2014 foreign exchange loss includes a loss of 11 million on forward contracts related to the acquisition of sauflon 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 247 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 154 million in fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income for fiscal 2014 was 83 and 49 for fiscal 2013 the increase in the etr in fiscal 2014 reflects the inclusion in the fiscal 2013 etr of several discrete items causing a reduction in that year these items related primarily to the statutory income tax rate reduction in the united kingdom and the renewal of the rd tax credit in the united states 

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the united states as a result the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income has decreased over recent fiscal years effectively lowering the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states 

the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 855 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 26 in our fiscal year 2014 compared to 970 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 06 in our fiscal year 2013 the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates as compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

share repurchases 

in december 2011 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program and subsequently amended the total repurchase authorization to 5000 million the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time during fiscal 2014 we repurchased 572 thousand shares of our common stock for 758 million at an average purchase price of 13249 per share during fiscal 2013 we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for 1673 million at an average purchase price of 11778 per share at october 31 2014 we had remaining authorization to repurchase about 1857 million of our common stock see the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2014 was 387 million and 117 million respectively compared to 304 million and 88 million respectively in fiscal 2013 as of october 31 2014 there was 540 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 49 million for stock options 409 million for restricted stock units and 82 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 30 years for nonvested stock options 34 years for restricted stock units and 16 years for performance shares cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 was 86 million 193 million and 551 million respectively 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2014 would have increased by approximately 350 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2014 would have increased by less than 1 

we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjust the rate of expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we grant performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers and other key employees if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if the goals are not achieved or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized

working capital in fiscal 2014 includes 551 million of loan notes issued related to the acquisition of sauflon excluding these loan notes that are reported in shortterm debt the decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 from the end of fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the decrease in cash and increases in accounts payable and short term debt this decrease was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

 in fiscal 2014 and 2013 we performed qualitative assessments to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense 

 

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations our policy is to reduce to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into a limited number of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound sterling euro japanese yen danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar our policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical transaction remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely a hypothetical 5 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities including the revolving credit agreement and term loans may vary with the london interbank offered rate libor we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through december 2014 

on august 4 2014 we entered into a threeyear 7000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on august 4 2017 there is no amortization of the principal and we may prepay the loan balances from time to time in whole or in part with premium or penalty at october 31 2014 7000 million remained outstanding on this term loan 

on september 12 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement that will mature on september 12 2018 and will be subject to amortization of principal of 5 per year payable quarterly beginning october 31 2016 with the balance payable at maturity at october 31 2014 3000 million remained outstanding on this term loan 

on may 31 2012 we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement originally entered into on january 12 2011 the aggregate revolving commitment was increased to 10 billion from 7500 million this facility offers additional availability lower interest rates and extends the maturity date to may 31 2017 from january 12 2016 in addition we have the ability to increase the facility by up to an additional 5000 million keybank led the refinancing with certain banks that participated in the credit agreement retaining or increasing their participation at october 31 2014 we had 7203 million available under the revolving credit agreement 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 



at october 31 2014  the scheduled maturities of our fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 



as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2014  it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2014  we had one interest rate swap outstanding that is designed to fix the variable borrowing costs related to 400 million of the outstanding balance on our credit agreements if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about 128 million for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

coopervision and coopersurgical each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations both of coopers businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 



coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses silicone hydrogel lenses now represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity® brand is coopervisions leading product line under the biofinity brand coopervision has launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products over the past five years coopervision has also launched twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our avaira® brand in fiscal 2013 we launched myday tm  our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens in europe 

in addition coopervision lenses compete based on providing superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology coopervision lenses have a round to partial round edge which we believe increases comfort coopervisions proclear® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a material that incorporates phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim … may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

in addition to its pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with its traditional hydrogel products 

contact lens product sales 

spheres net sales of coopervisions spherical lenses representing 56 percent of coopervisions net sales grew 4 percent in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 singleuse spherical lens net sales representing 21 percent of net sales grew 1 percent 

toric and multifocal net sales of coopervisions toric lenses representing 31 percent of coopervisions net sales grew 9 percent in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 multifocal lens net sales representing 10 percent of net sales grew 29 percent in fiscal 2013 

proclear net sales of coopervisions pc technology products  which consist of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics® xc and proclear® 1 day  grew 6 percent in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and represented 25 percent of coopervisions net sales 



silicone hydrogel  coopervisions silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products grew 26 percent in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and represented 43 percent of coopervisions net sales as compared to 36 percent in fiscal 2012 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc 

over the past decade the contact lens industry has experienced a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses and toward singleuse lenses coopervisions primary competitors control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market coopervision was late in entering the silicone hydrogel segment of the market but now has significant sales of monthly and twoweek spherical toric and multifocal silicone hydrogel offerings and it has recently introduced a silicone hydrogel singleuse spherical lens 

in the toric lens market a similar shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses has occurred but we believe that lens manufacturers also continue to compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners coopervision competes based on its three manufacturing processes yielding wider ranges of toric lens parameters providing wide choices for patient and practitioner and superior visual acuity as well as by offering excellent customer service including high standards of ontime product delivery 

coopervisions primary competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the companys lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that its contact lenses will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses and there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses

based on united states census estimates coopersurgical expects patient visits to united states obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is an increasing base of reproductive age women a large and stable middleaged population and a rapidly growing population of women over the age of 65 coopersurgical believes that the resurgence of population growth in the reproductive age group will result in increased office visits related to birth control and childbearing coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond office visit activity related to menopausal problems including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade coopersurgical believes that in the past clinicians primarily saw women only during their reproductive years now with new treatment options available and a more educated population coopersurgical expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later 

another trend in the market for womens healthcare includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health systems coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 



some significant features of this market are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coopersurgicals fiscal 2013 net sales growth 

during fiscal 2013 coopersurgicals net sales grew 25 percent or 3 percent excluding acquisitions to 3194 million from 2559 million in fiscal 2012 representing 20 percent of coopers net sales in fiscal 2013 compared to 18 percent in fiscal 2012 with the acquisition of origio in july 2012 sales of fertility products now represent 33 percent of coopersurgicals net sales as compared to 16 percent in fiscal 2012 

coopersurgical competition 

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the womens healthcare market supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes based on its sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of its products coopersurgicals strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands its product line it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

coopersurgical is seeking to expand its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnsons ethicon endosurgery and ethicon womens health and urology companies boston scientific gyrus acmi and covidien these competitors have well established positions within the operating room 



environment coopersurgical intends to leverage its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate its expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

research and development 

cooper employs about 245 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments most of these employees are in coopervision coopervision product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry clinical trials microbiology and biochemistry coopervisions research and development activities primarily include programs to develop new contact lens designs 

coopersurgical conducts research and development inhouse and also has consulting agreements with external surgical specialists coopersurgicals research and development activities include the design and upgrading of surgical procedure devices the upgrade and expansion of coopersurgicals portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products including origio products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings 

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were 588 million 517 million and 436 million respectively research and development expenditures represented 4 percent of net sales in fiscal 2013 and 2012 and 3 percent in 2011 during fiscal 2013 coopervision represented 79 percent and coopersurgical represented 21 percent of the total research and development expenses we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs during fiscal 2011  2013 

government regulation 

medical device regulation 

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas 



quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 



after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans outweighs the risks and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda regulation 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling new fda unique device identifier legislation which requires changes to labeling and packaging the recently enacted physician payments sunshine act requiring the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners made after august 1 2013 and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 



even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion can result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there the worldwide medical device regulations are increasing with many countries becoming regulated for the first time for example hong kong and singapore are now regulated and following the global harmonization task force model for regulating medical devices these emerging regulated countries require the same rigorous safety data compiled in preclinical and clinical studies for the rest of the world japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws and laws pertaining to healthcare privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  



raw materials 

coopervisions raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets its products in the united states through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision augments its united states sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing social media and advertising in professional journals in the emea and asia pacific regions coopervision primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries coopervision uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products within specific geographic areas 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors in the united states coopersurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows professional educational programs and internet promotions including e‑commerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals origio products are marketed globally through its field sales representatives and distributors 

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of coopers products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect its intellectual property rights aggressively 

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than our license agreement effective as of november 19 2007 between coopervision and ciba vision ag and ciba vision corporation this license relates to patents covering coopervisions silicone hydrogel contact lens products the company’s royalty obligations under this license agreement extend until the expiration of the applicable patent rights which the company believes will occur in september 2014 in the united states and in march 2016 outside of the united states 

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

dependence on customers 

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 



government contracts 

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

backlog 

backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers business units 

seasonality 

coopervisions contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

compliance with environmental laws 

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb inc owned by valeant pharmaceuticals international inc have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration andor larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens healthcare market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in 



potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations in fiscal 2012 coopersurgical completed the acquisition of origio as this acquisition added significant operations to coopersurgical and greatly expanded its international business the origio acquisition has correspondingly added risks to coopersurgical risks we could face with respect to acquisitions including the origio acquisition include 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the healthcare industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical does not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather it has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopervision has been investing in new product development since 2005 including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although coopervision focuses on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits in addition we have been slower to introduce new silicone hydrogel contact lens products than our competitors which put these products at a competitive disadvantage the 



development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care and womens healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations for coopervision and our newly acquired origio business are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately twothirds of our net sales for coopervision for the fiscal years ended october 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 



 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as the growing us deficit high energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market foreign countries in particular the euro zone are affected by similar systemic impacts as a result we continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in fiscal 2014 

continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing or distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 



coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas malov denmark and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we generally have not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of west henrietta new york hampshire united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in trumbull connecticut and malov denmark any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a cgmp qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice for example some of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products including myday biofinity and avaira are supplied by a sole supplier we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if our suppliers particularly those which are the sole source of any necessary material fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 



if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also may seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on unpatented proprietary technology or technology where patents will expire in less than a few years it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 



the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision has faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to 



product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful 



in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars to the extent we are unable to materially offset nonnonfunctional currency flows exchange rate fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our net exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our nonfunctional currency obligations or balances these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 



we manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

we utilize complex computer systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical devices design development testing manufacture safety labeling including for example the upcoming fda unique device identifier regulations storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets 



our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products for example the fda recently has been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510k program in january 2011 the fda announced a plan of action that included twentyfive action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs some of these changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances for our products increase the cost of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations the reporting of certain payments to health care practitioners in certain markets for example the french sunshine act of 2013 duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 



in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found for example coopervision recently concluded a recall of limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses and avaira sphere contact lenses recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act which we refer to collectively as the health care reform law the health care reform law makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the health care reform law of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

 



interests held by physicians or their immediate family members and any payments or other “transfers of value” to such owners manufacturers were required to begin data collection on august 1 2013 and will be required to report such data to the government by march 31 2014 and by the 90 th calendar day of each year thereafter 

 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts at this time the full effect that the health care reform law would have on our business remains unclear for example the health care reform law imposes a new excise tax of 23 percent of the price for which certain medical devices are sold which went into effect on january 1 2013 coopervision is not affected by this new tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of almost all of coopersurgicals products are subject to this new tax we cannot anticipate at this time the magnitude of this new tax as there are significant uncertainties concerning key definitions and terms within the law 

other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the health care reform law was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs these reductions include aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers 

we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products or result in additional pricing pressures also any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 



the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the americas recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under the hitech act certain of hipaas privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions 

  

while we do not believe that we are a covered entity or a business associate under hipaa many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information as defined by hipaa that we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information pursuant to the hitech act if the government determines that we are a business associate we could be additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements in addition the final omnibus rule released in january 2013 among other things modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that will likely make more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and new legal and regulatory requirements and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 



laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

indeed changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws the advanced medical technology association advamed a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers has also released a revised code of ethics outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals this code became effective july 1 2009 these laws regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the recent health care reform law among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the health care reform law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

note numbers refer to “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

results of operations 

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  and the results of our operations for fiscal 2012  compared with fiscal 2011  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

outlook 

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by united states debt and uncertainty surrounding employment housing and credit concerns together with the european debt crisis and related foreign currency volatility impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2014 

we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using silicone hydrogel aquaform ®  technology and phosphorylcholine technology pc technology™ we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we introduce new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability coopervision markets monthly and twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our biofinity ®  and avaira ®  brands and a multifocal lens under biofinity 

we believe that the global market for singleuse contact lenses is expanding and will continue to grow in fiscal 2013 we launched myday tm  our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens in europe and in fiscal 2012 we launched proclear ® 1 day multifocal we forecast increasing demand for our existing and future singleuse products to meet this anticipated demand in fiscal 2014 we plan to continue the implementation of capital projects to invest in increased singleuse manufacturing capacity competitive silicone hydrogel singleuse lens products are gaining market share and represent a risk to our business 

on october 31 2013 we completed a transaction to sell aime our rigid gaspermeable contact lens and solutions business in japan to nippon contact lens inc in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a pretax loss of approximately 211 million the business was originally obtained as part of the december 1 2010 acquisition which included obtaining the rights to market biofinity in japan the divestiture is consistent with the strategy to focus on our core soft contact lens business additionally aime revenue has declined in recent periods and the products have lower than average company margins results from operations of aime are included in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 post divestiture we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings per share

as part of the new health care reform law a 23 excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the united states with limited exceptions became effective january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this new tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of coopersurgicals products are subject to this new tax which is primarily recorded in selling general and administrative expense on the statement of income 

on september 12 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement term loan that will mature on september 12 2018 and will be subject to amortization of principal of 5 per year payable quarterly beginning october 31 2016 with the balance payable at maturity we utilized the funds provided by this term loan to repay amounts outstanding on our revolving credit agreement and at october 31 2013 3000 million remained outstanding on the term loan 

at october 31 2013 we had 9998 million available under the revolving credit agreement we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and longterm cash requirements for capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and cash dividends

coopervision’s worldwide net sales grew 6 in the yeartoyear comparison americas net sales grew 6 primarily due to market gains of coopervision’s silicone hydrogel lenses and singleuse lenses emea net sales grew 1 primarily driven by sales growth of silicone hydrogel lenses as sales in fiscal 2012 were negatively impacted due to the weakening euro and the british pound compared to the united states dollar net sales to the asia pacific region grew 14 primarily due to sales growth in fiscal 2012 of singleuse lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses asia pacific net sales growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the japanese yen and australian dollar compared to the united states dollar

cost of salesgross profit 



the increase in coopervisions gross margin is largely attributable to the lower royalty payment on our silicone hydrogel products beginning on january 1 2013 increased manufacturing efficiencies and product mix sales of higher margin biofinity products increased as compared to the prior year sales of our lower margin avaira family of products also grew in the fiscal 2013 as we completed the relaunch of these products that compete in the twoweek modality market gross margin was unfavorably impacted by lower net sales on products sold in japan due to the weakening of the japanese yen as compared to the united states dollar in fiscal 2013 the sequential increases in gross margin over the fiscal years presented are largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix primarily the shift to higher margin biofinity silicone hydrogel products we expect our plans to ramp up production of myday our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens to provide headwinds to our gross margin over future fiscal periods 

the decrease in coopersurgicals gross margin for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 is largely attributable to product mix and increased sales of lower margin fertility products due to the acquisition of origio in july 2012 sales of lower margin fertility products now represent 33 of net sales compared to 16 in fiscal 2012 the increase in coopersurgical’s gross margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is largely attributable to manufacturing efficiency improvements and product mix the changes in product mix included higher margins on products used in surgical procedures that grew 19 over the prior year and represented 36 of net sales in fiscal 2012 or 40 excluding origio sales for the last four months of 2012 compared to 37 in fiscal 2011 the increase was partially offset by the inclusion of four months of sales of lower margin fertility products from the acquisition of origio in july 2012 

selling general and administrative expense sga 



consolidated sga decreased to 38 of net sales in fiscal 2013 from 39 of net sales in fiscal 2012 and was flat as compared to fiscal 2011 

the 3 increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 in absolute dollars is primarily due to our investment in sales and marketing including increased headcount to reach new customers and support geographic expansion programs included the promotion of our silicone hydrogel products including myday our singleuse spherical silicone hydrogel lens and proclear 1 day multifocal in japan sga as a percent of net sales decreased to 35 from 36 and 37 in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively primarily due to reduced legal costs and the 100 million patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2011 discussed below 

the 27 increase in coopersurgicals sga in absolute dollars in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and the increase as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to operating expenses related to origio including approximately 06 million of acquisition costs in fiscal 2013 in addition to the acquisition and integration 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

activities related to origio coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products with emphasis on products used in surgical procedures and to reach new customers on january 1 2013 the new medical device excise tax became effective on sales of coopersurgicals products in the united states and added 24 million to sga expense in fiscal 2013 

the 32 increase in coopersurgicals sga in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as well as the increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to operating expenses related to origio as well as approximately 46 million of acquisition costs expensed in fiscal 2012 fiscal 2012 sga was 34 as a percentage of net sales the same as fiscal 2011 excluding origio operating expenses and related acquisition costs 

corporate headquarters’ sga increased 15 in absolute dollars in fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs the 19 growth in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increased sharebased compensation costs and legal expenses 

research and development expense rd 



the sequential increases in coopervisions rd in absolute dollars over the fiscal years presented and the fiscal 2012 increase as a percentage of net sales as compared to the prior year are primarily due to investments in new technologies clinical trials and increased headcount coopervision’s research and development activities primarily include programs to develop new contact lens designs 

the sequential increases in coopersurgicals rd in absolute dollars over the fiscal years presented and the fiscal 2012 increase as a percentage of net sales as compared to the prior year are due to the addition of origios invitro fertilization product development and investments in the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices 

divested operation 

on october 31 2013 we completed a transaction to sell aime our rigid gaspermeable contact lens and solutions business in japan to nippon contact lens inc the business was originally obtained as part of the december 1 2010 acquisition which included obtaining the rights to market biofinity in japan the divestiture is consistent with coopervision’s strategy to focus on its core soft contact lens business additionally aime revenue has declined in recent periods and the products have lower than average company margins post divestiture we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings per share 

the aime divestiture was originally announced on may 31 2013 and met the criteria for classification as held for sale during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed several conditions to closing and facilitated the transfer of manufacturing technology we recorded a pretax loss of approximately 211 million in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2013 results from operations of aime are included in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and we have not segregated the results of operations or net assets of aime on our financial statements for any period presented the disposition of the assets and liabilities of aime did not qualify for classification as discontinued operations as coopervision shall maintain continuing involvement through a distribution arrangement with aime for a minimum of three years

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles was 302 million in fiscal 2013 240 million in fiscal 2012 and 205 million in fiscal 2011 the 26 increase in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and the 17 increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 were primarily due to intangible assets from acquisitions primarily the acquisition of origio in july 2012 

settlements 

on december 2 2011 coopervision and rembrandt vision technologies lp entered into a settlement agreement under which coopervision agreed to make a lump sum payment of 100 million to rembrandt and rembrandt executed a covenant not to sue regarding patent infringement claims we recorded a charge in selling general and administrative expense for the settlement in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 

operating income 

operating income grew 784 million or 35 between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013 increasing 226 million or 8 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 and 558 million or 25 in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 



the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 in absolute dollars was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 11 partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of 13 the decrease in consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the 211 million loss on divestiture of aime discussed above recorded in operating expenses for coopervision coopersurgicals operating income in fiscal 2012 increased in absolute dollars primarily due to the increase in gross profit that also included the results of origio beginning in july 2012 and operating income decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the 46 million of origio acquisition costs 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 22 to 92 million in fiscal 2013 constituting 06 of net sales in fiscal 2013 as compared to 08 of net sales in fiscal 2012 the fiscal 2013 decrease reflects lower average debt and lower average interest rates in the current year interest expense decreased 32 to 118 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 reflecting lower average debt and the reduction in our longterm borrowings used for capital expenditures together with lower interest rates as a result of the redemption of our 7125 senior notes in february 2011 we had 3000 million outstanding on the new term loan and 02 million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at october 31 2013 compared to 3463 million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at october 31 2012 

insurance proceeds 

on october 28 2011 a manufacturing building in the united kingdom experienced an incident in which a pipe broke in our fire suppression system causing water and fire retardant foam damage to the facility while this incident did not substantially impact our existing customers the repairs to the facility and resultant decrease in manufacturing capacity impacted the timing of marketing initiatives to generate additional sales in january 2013 we resolved our business interruption claim with our insurer for a total of 191  million 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we received payments of 50  million in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 in our fiscal first quarter of 2013 we recorded the remaining 141  million in our consolidated statement of income of which we received payment of 29  million during the fiscal first quarter and payment of the remaining 112  million in the fiscal second quarter 

losses on extinguishment of debt 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded a 14 million loss related to the amendment to our revolving credit agreement on may 31 2012 in fiscal 2011 we recorded a 165 million loss related to the repurchase of all outstanding 7125 senior notes that includes the writeoff of about 44 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of 121 million 

other income expense net 



provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 154 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 268 million in fiscal 2012 our effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income for fiscal 2013 was 49 and for fiscal 2012 was 97 the decrease in the etr in fiscal 2013 is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income as well as discrete items primarily the loss on divestiture of aime the decrease in the united kingdoms tax rate and the reinstatement of the federal rd credit 

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the united states as a result the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income primarily within coopervision but augmented by coopersurgicals july 2012 acquisition of origio has decreased over recent fiscal periods a reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where we operate are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states 

the impact on our provision for income taxes of income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the united states federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 970 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 06 in our fiscal year 2013 compared to 713 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 51 in our fiscal year 2012 the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates as compared to the united states federal statutory rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the fiscal years presented include the united kingdom barbados and puerto rico see note 5 for additional information 

share repurchases 

in december 2011 we announced a 1500 million share repurchase program and in december 2012 the total authorized repurchase amount was increased to 3000 million both authorized by our board of directors the program has no expiration date and may be discontinued at any time during fiscal 2013 we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock for 1673 million at an average purchase price of 11778 per share during fiscal 2012 we repurchased 984 thousand shares of our common stock for 711 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

million at an average purchase price of 7230 per share at october 31 2013 we had remaining authorization to repurchase about 615 million of our common stock subsequent to our fiscal year end the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 2000 million under this program increasing the remaining authorization to 2615 million see note 7 for additional information 

sharebased compensation plans 

we grant various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2013 was 304 million and 88 million respectively compared to 228 million and 70 million respectively in fiscal 2012 as of october 31 2013 there was 555 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 90 million for stock options 367 million for restricted stock units and 98 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 31 years for nonvested stock options 31 years for restricted stock units and 17 years for performance shares cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 was 193 million 551 million and 820 million respectively 

we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2013 would have increased by approximately 3 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2013 would have increased by less than 1 

we estimate stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

we grant performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers and other key employees if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period we estimate the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates we review our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively

2013 highlights 

 comparative statistics 



working capital 

the increase in working capital at the end of fiscal 2013 from the end of fiscal 2012 was primarily due to increases in cash inventory and other current assets this increase was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and shortterm debt 

the 187 million increase in inventory was primarily due to increased production of singleuse silicone contact lenses and to support the relaunch of avaira toric contact lenses at october 31 2013 our inventory months on hand moh were 69 representing an increase from 67 at october 31 2012 due to the increase in inventory and the reduction of the royalty payment recognized in costs of sales for coopervisions silicone hydrogel contact lenses the 48 million decrease in trade accounts receivable was primarily due to timing of collections as well as the divestiture of aime in october 2013 our days sales outstanding dso decreased to 53 days at october 31 2013 from 54 days at october 31 2012 

we have reviewed our needs in the united states for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of our foreign subsidiaries we presently intend to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the united states of all foreign subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property plant and equipment requirements 

operating cash flow 

cash flow provided by operating activities continued in fiscal 2013 as our major source of liquidity at 4159 million compared to 3151 million in fiscal 2012 and 3363 million in fiscal 2011 fiscal 2013 net income increased 483 million from the prior year to 2969 million and our results include 1275 million of noncash items primarily related to depreciation and amortization 285 million related to sharebased compensation 211 million related to the divestiture of aime and 89 million related to currency translation results also include changes in operating assets and liabilities which primarily reflect the increases in 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

inventories and accrued income taxes payable the 1008 million increase in cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily due to the fiscal 2013 increase in net income that includes the loss on divestiture of aime and the 141 million for insurance proceeds received and the lower investment in inventories compared to fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013 our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products and the 141 million for insurance proceeds received our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of 54 million for interest 

for fiscal 2012 our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of 106 million for interest and the 100 million single lumpsum payment accrued in fiscal 2011 to settle the rembrandt vision technologies lp lawsuit under the agreement reached on december 2 2011 

investing cash flow 

cash used in investing activities of 1899 million in fiscal 2013 was for capital expenditures of 1781 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of 133 million related to acquisitions partially offset by the 13 million insurance recovery related to facility repairs as discussed in outlook above during fiscal 2013 coopervision implemented capital projects to invest in increased singleuse manufacturing capacity which is the primarily driver of the 1174 million increase in construction in progress 

cash used in investing activities of 2385 million in fiscal 2012 was for capital expenditures of 998 million primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and payments of 1453 million related to acquisitions primarily the acquisition of origio partially offset by the 66 million insurance recovery related to facility repairs 

financing cash flow 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as share repurchases and sharebased compensation awards cash used in financing activities of 1616 million in fiscal 2013 was driven by 258 million for net repayments of debt 1673 million in payments for share repurchases under our share repurchase plan 52 million to purchase origio shares and other distributions to noncontrolling interests a 36 million payment for contingent consideration and 29 million for dividends cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 374 million from the exercise of sharebased compensation awards and 59 million from a construction allowance 

in fiscal 2012 the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily related to borrowings and payments of debt as well as sharebased compensation awards and share repurchases cash used in financing activities of 684 million in fiscal 2012 was driven by 567 million for net repayments of debt including repayment of debt acquired with origio and 712 million in payments for share repurchases under our share repurchase plan together with dividends paid on our common stock of 29 million 22 million to purchase origio shares from noncontrolling interests and a 13 million payment for contingent consideration cash used in financing activities was partially offset by 551 million from the exercise of sharebased compensation awards and 107 million for the excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements 

at october 31 2013 we had 3000 million outstanding on the new term loan and 9998 million available under the revolving credit agreement and we are in compliance with our financial covenants including the interest coverage ratio at 5429 to 100 and the total leverage ratio at 069 to 100 as defined in both

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

we review the carrying value of our inventory measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability we reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market resulting in a new lowercost basis for that inventory subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis while estimates are involved historically obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles we target to keep on average five  to seven  months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and womens healthcare product portfolios 

 in fiscal 2013 and 2012 we performed qualitative assessments to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed 

  

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition

enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense 

 

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the united states treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations our policy is to reduce to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into a limited number of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively we do not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound euro and japanese yen our policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical transaction remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured syndicated credit facilities including the revolving credit agreement and term loan may vary with the london interbank offered rate libor we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through december 2014 

on september 12 2013 we entered into a fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured term loan agreement term loan that will mature on september 12 2018 and will be subject to amortization of principal of 5 per year payable quarterly beginning october 31 2016 with the balance payable at maturity we utilized the funds provided by this term loan to repay amounts outstanding on our revolving credit agreement and at october 31 2013 3000 million remained outstanding on the term loan 

on may 31 2012 we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement originally entered into on january 12 2011 the aggregate revolving commitment was increased to 10 billion from 7500 million this facility offers additional availability lower interest rates and extends the maturity date to may 31 2017 from january 12 2016 in addition we have the ability to increase the facility by up to an additional 5000 million keybank led the refinancing with certain banks that participated in the credit agreement retaining or increasing their participation 

in february 2011 we redeemed all 3390 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7125 senior notes issued on january 31 2007 in accordance with the terms of the indenture from borrowings under the credit agreement in accordance with the indenture the redemption price for the notes was 103563 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to february 15 2011 the redemption date in fiscal 2011 we recorded a 165 million loss on the repurchase that includes the writeoff of about 44 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of 121 million related to the senior notes on our consolidated statement of income 



at october 31 2013  the scheduled maturities of our fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 



as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2013  it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2013  we had interest rate swaps outstanding that are designed to fix the variable borrowing costs related to 2000 million of the outstanding balance on our credit agreements if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about 10 million for further information about our debt see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper we or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 is a global medical device company publicly traded on the nyse euronext nyse coo cooper is dedicated to being a quality of life company tm  with a focus on shareholder value cooper operates through two business units coopervision inc and coopersurgical inc 

  

coopervision is a global manufacturer providing products for contact lens wearers coopervision develops manufactures and markets a broad range of monthly twoweek and singleuse contact lenses featuring advanced materials and optics coopervisions products are designed to solve vision challenges such as astigmatism presbyopia and ocular dryness with a broad collection of spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses coopervisions products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in hampshire united kingdom juana diaz puerto rico and west henrietta new york coopervision distributes products from west henrietta new york fareham united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

  

coopersurgical focuses on supplying womens health clinicians with products and treatment options to improve the delivery of healthcare to women coopersurgicals primary objectives include internal growth and growth through acquisitions to expand its core businesses and the introduction of advanced technologybased products to aid clinicians in the management and treatment of commonly seen conditions coopersurgical customers are healthcare professionals and institutions providing care to and for women coopersurgical products support the point of healthcare delivery in the hospital clinicians office and fertility clinics coopersurgicals major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in trumbull connecticut malov denmark pasadena california stafford texas golden colorado and berlin germany 

  

coopervision and coopersurgical each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations both of coopers businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 



coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

 

 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses silicone hydrogel lenses now represent a significant portion of coopervisions contact lens sales and our biofinity® brand is coopervisions leading product line under the biofinity brand coopervision has launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products over the past five years coopervision has also launched twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our avaira® brand in fiscal 2012 we initiated limited marketing of our first silicone hydrogel singleuse spherical lens in selected european markets 

in addition coopervision lenses compete based on providing superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology coopervision lenses have a round to partial round edge which we believe increases comfort coopervisions proclear® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a material that incorporates phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim … may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

in addition to its pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with its traditional hydrogel products 

contact lens product sales 

spheres net sales of coopervisions spherical lenses representing 60 percent of coopervisions soft lens net sales grew 5 percent in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 singleuse spherical lens net sales representing 23 percent of soft lens sales grew 10 percent 

toric and multifocal net sales of coopervisions toric lenses representing 31 percent of coopervisions soft lens net sales grew 5 percent in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 multifocal lens net sales representing 8 percent of soft lens net sales grew 26 percent in fiscal 2012 

proclear net sales of coopervisions pc technology products  which consist of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics® xc and proclear® 1 day  were flat in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and represented 26 percent of coopervisions soft lens net sales 



silicone hydrogel  coopervisions silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products grew 28 percent in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and represented 38 percent of coopervisions soft lens net sales as compared to 31 percent in fiscal 2011 

coopervision competition 

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervisions three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

over the past decade the contact lens industry has experienced a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses and toward singleuse lenses in the spherical market coopervisions primary competitors control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market coopervision was late in entering the silicone hydrogel segment of the market but now has significant sales of monthly and twoweek spherical toric and multifocal silicone hydrogel offerings and it has recently introduced a silicone hydrogel singleuse spherical lens 

in the toric lens market a similar shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses has occurred but we believe that lens manufacturers also continue to compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners coopervision competes based on its three manufacturing processes yielding wider ranges of toric lens parameters providing wide choices for patient and practitioner and superior visual acuity as well as by offering excellent customer service including high standards of ontime product delivery 

coopervisions major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the companys lens products 

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that its contact lenses will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses and there are opportunities for contact lenses to gain market share particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses 

coopervision developments with the us food and drug administration 

in august 2011 coopervision initiated a recall on limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses in november 2011 this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of avaira sphere contact lenses the recall was initiated because of the level of a residue silicone oil on certain lenses the residue may cause hazy vision severe eye pain or an eye injury the manufacturing issue was identified and process changes were implemented these process changes were reviewed by the united states food and drug administration fda as part of a 510k application the fda cleared the 510k application in april 2012 and the company resumed distribution of the avaira toric lenses avaira sphere lenses remained on the market throughout the recall period this recall was limited solely to specific lots of avaira toric and avaira sphere contact lenses and no other coopervision products were involved in this recall 



coopersurgical 

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products used in the care and treatment of womens health the company participates in the womens healthcare market through offering quality products innovative technologies and superior service to clinicians worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with clinicians to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to sophisticated instruments and equipment the result is a broad portfolio of proven products that aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that healthcare professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of womens health issues 

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

recent acquisition 

in july 2012 coopersurgical completed a voluntary tender offer for the outstanding shares of origio as origio is a global invitro fertilization ivf medical device company that develops manufactures and distributes highly specialized products that target ivf treatment with a goal to make fertility treatment safer more efficient and convenient based in malov denmark origio with approximately 320 employees is a leader in delivering innovative assisted reproductive technology art solutions that enhance the work of art professionals to the benefit of families with 13 subsidiaries and several distributors origio has a worldwide presence with a broad product portfolio for the art market along with professional training programs 

market for womens healthcare 

coopersurgical participates in the market for womens healthcare with its diversified product lines of over 600 products coopersurgical products are in three major categories based on the point of healthcare delivery hospitals obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

based on united states census estimates coopersurgical expects patient visits to united states obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is an increasing base of reproductive age women a large and stable middleaged population and a rapidly growing population of women over the age of 65 coopersurgical believes that the resurgence of population growth in the reproductive age group will result in increased office visits related to birth control and childbearing coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond office visit activity related to menopausal problems including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade coopersurgical believes that in the past clinicians primarily saw women only during their reproductive years now with new treatment options available and a more educated population coopersurgical expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later 

another trend in the market for womens healthcare includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and toward aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health systems coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near term 

while general medical practitioners play an important role in womens primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 



some significant features of this market are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

coopersurgicals fiscal 2012 net sales growth 

during fiscal 2012 coopersurgicals net sales grew 22 percent to 2559 million from 2097 million in fiscal 2011 representing 18 percent of coopers net sales in fiscal 2012 compared to 16 in fiscal 2011 net sales growth excluding acquisitions was 6 percent sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 19 percent and represented 36 percent or 40 percent excluding the origio acquisition of coopersurgicals total net sales as compared to 37 percent in fiscal 2011 

coopersurgical competition 

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the womens healthcare market supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes based on its sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of its products coopersurgicals strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands its product line it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

coopersurgical is seeking to expand its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnsons ethicon endosurgery and ethicon womens health and urology companies boston scientific gyrus acmi and covidien these competitors have well established positions within the operating room 



environment coopersurgical intends to leverage its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate its expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

research and development 

cooper employs about 200 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments most of these employees are in coopervision coopervision product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry clinical trials microbiology and biochemistry coopervisions research and development activities primarily include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products 

coopersurgical conducts research and development inhouse and also has consulting agreements with external surgical specialists coopersurgicals research and development activities include the design and upgrading of surgical procedure devices the upgrade and expansion of coopersurgicals portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products including origio products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings 

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were 517 million 436 million and 353 million respectively research and development expenditures represented 4 percent of net sales in fiscal 2012 and 3 percent in 2011 and 2010 during fiscal 2012 coopervision represented 82 percent and coopersurgical represented 18 percent of the total research and development expenses we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs during fiscal 2010  2012 

government regulation 

medical device regulation 

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

device classification 

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes  class i ii or iii  depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgicals products are class ii devices 

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fdas general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fdas 



quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

class ii devices are subject to the fdas general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

510k clearance pathway 

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturers determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturers determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

premarket approval pathway 

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fdas satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 



after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

clinical trials 

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans outweighs the risks and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

continuing fda regulation 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations 



prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion can result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

foreign regulation 

health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there the worldwide medical device regulations are increasing with many countries becoming regulated for the first time for example hong kong and singapore are now regulated and following the global harmonization task force model for regulating medical devices these emerging regulated countries require the same rigorous safety data compiled in preclinical and clinical studies for the rest of the world japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations china is also updating its regulations and is requiring rigorous incountry product testing 

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

other health care regulation 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws and laws pertaining to healthcare privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

raw materials 

coopervisions raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products in fiscal 2011 coopervision purchased certain assets of asahikasei aime co ltd aime our current sole supplier of the primary 



material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products from asahi kasei pharma corporation while this acquisition has increased coopervisions control over the sourcing of certain raw materials if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

marketing and distribution 

coopervision markets its products in the united states through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors coopervision augments its united states sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing social media and advertising in professional journals in the emea and asia pacific regions coopervision primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries coopervision uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products within specific geographic areas 

coopersurgicals products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors in the united states coopersurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows professional educational programs and internet promotions including e‑commerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals origio products are marketed globally through its field sales representatives and distributors 

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of coopers products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect its intellectual property rights aggressively 

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than our license agreement effective as of november 19 2007 between coopervision and ciba vision ag and ciba vision corporation this license relates to patents covering coopervisions silicone hydrogel contact lens products biofinity® and avaira® this license extends until the patents expire in september 2014 in the united states and in march 2016 outside of the united states 

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

dependence on customers 

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 



government contracts 

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

backlog 

backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers business units 

seasonality 

coopervisions contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

compliance with environmental laws 

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

risks relating to our business 

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb inc have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that our competitors newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervisions contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the womens healthcare market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in 



potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations recently coopersurgical completed the acquisition of origio as this acquisition added significant operations to coopersurgical and greatly expanded its international business the origio acquisition has correspondingly added risks to coopersurgical risks we could face with respect to acquisitions including the origio acquisition include 

 

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence if we are unable to develop new products or gain regulatory approvals or if our competitors introduce new products 

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the areas of the healthcare industry in which coopersurgical competes coopersurgical does not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather it has historically purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others coopervision has been investing in new product development since 2005 including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although coopervision focuses on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits in addition we have been slower to introduce new silicone hydrogel contact lens products than our competitors which put these products at a competitive disadvantage the 



development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

 

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

technological developments in the eye care and womens healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

a significant portion of our current operations for coopervision and our newly acquired origio business are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately twothirds of our net sales for coopervision for the fiscal years ended october 31 2012 and 2011 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

 



 

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as the growing us deficit high energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market foreign countries in particular the euro zone are affected by similar systemic impacts as a result we continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in fiscal 2013 

continued turbulence in the united states and international market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 



coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas malov denmark and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

coopervision distributes products out of west henrietta new york hampshire united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities coopersurgicals products are primarily distributed out of its facilities in trumbull connecticut and malov denmark any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted our products could be subject to recall and sales and profitability could suffer 

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fdas cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a cgmp qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice we purchased asahikasei aime co ltd to achieve greater control over certain of the raw materials used in our silicone hydrogel contact lenses however asahikasei finechem asahi remains our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products biofinity and avaira we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if asahi or other suppliers fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 



if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

 

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

both coopervision and coopersurgical also rely on unpatented proprietary technology or technology where patents will expire in less than a few years it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable 

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 



the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products in the contact lens industry coopervision and its competitors all hold patents covering contact lens designs business methods processes and materials claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industries for example coopervision has faced significant patent litigation over its silicone hydrogel contact lens products third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

 we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to 



product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

we face risks related to environmental matters 

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

our indebtedness could 

 

our credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful 



in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro japanese yen danish krone and canadian dollar we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely these hedges may also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis 

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results 

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs   

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 



we manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

we utilize complex computer systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place to keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical devices design development testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of 



administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products for example the fda has recently been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510k program in january 2011 the fda announced a plan of action that included twentyfive action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs some of these changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances for our products increase the cost of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturers decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 



in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fdas qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found for example coopervision recently concluded a recall of limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses and avaira sphere contact lenses recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to collectively as the health care reform law the health care reform law makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the health care reform law of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

 



 

these measures could result in decreased net revenues or increased expenses from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts many of the details regarding the implementation of the health care reform law are yet to be determined and at this time the full effect that the health care reform law would have on our business remains unclear for example the recently enacted health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 imposes a new excise tax of 23 percent of the price for which certain medical devices are sold and takes effect on january 1 2013 coopervision is not affected by this new tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of almost all of coopersurgicals products will be subject to this new tax we cannot anticipate at this time the magnitude of this new tax as there are significant uncertainties concerning key definitions and terms within the law 

  

also any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches in addition we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization 



claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the americas recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under the hitech act certain of hipaas privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions 

  

while we do not believe that we are a covered entity or a business associate under hipaa many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information as defined by hipaa that we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information pursuant to the hitech act if the government determines that we are a business associate we could be additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and new legal and regulatory requirements and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws indeed recent changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have already required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have 



adopted similar laws the advanced medical technology association advamed a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers has also recently released a revised code of ethics outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals this code became effective july 1 2009 these laws regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

in addition the recent health care reform law among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the health care reform law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

outlook 

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by us debt and uncertainty surrounding employment housing and credit concerns together with the european debt crisis and related foreign currency volatility impact our current performance and continue to represent a risk to our performance for fiscal year 2013 and beyond 

we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel aquaform ®  technology we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we introduce new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets including through acquisitions 

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly coopervision markets monthly and twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our biofinity ®  and avaira® brands and a multifocal lens under biofinity in july 2012 coopervision initiated limited marketing of our first silicone hydrogel singleuse spherical lens in selected european markets competitive silicone hydrogel singleuse lens products are gaining market share and represent a risk to our business our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability 

in fiscal 2012 we launched proclear ®  1 day multifocal and we are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance coopervision’s worldwide product lines new products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials and new lens designs including multifocal and singleuse lenses 

in august 2011 coopervision initiated a recall on limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses and in november 2011 this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of avaira sphere contact lenses avaira toric and avaira sphere lenses that were subject to the recall represented less than 2 of the companys fiscal 2011 net sales while avaira toric was taken off the market avaira sphere remained on the market throughout the recall on april 15 2012 the fda granted us a special 510k clearance to return avaira toric lenses to the market and in may 2012 coopervision relaunched avaira toric with shipments available for select distribution we are continuing to rollout avaira toric fitting sets and are working to build the avaira brand in the us twoweek market

the medical device segment of the womens healthcare market is highly fragmented coopersurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring companies and products that complement its business model in july 2012 we purchased origio a global invitro fertilization company discussed below we intend to continue to invest in coopersurgicals business through acquisitions of companies and product lines 

as part of the new health care reform law a 23 excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the united states with limited exceptions is effective january 1 2013 coopervisions products are not subject to this new tax because contact lenses are excluded from the tax however united states sales of almost all of coopersurgicals products will be subject to this new tax beginning in our fiscal first quarter of 2013 

on may 31 2012 we entered into an amendment to our senior unsecured credit agreement the aggregate commitment was increased to 10 billion from 7500 million and the 2344 million outstanding balance on the term loan was fully repaid using the facility the amended facility offers additional availability lower interest rates and extends the maturity date to may 31 2017 from january 12 2016 in addition we have the ability to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 5000 million 

at october 31 2012 we had 6537 million available under the amended credit agreement we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and longterm cash requirements for capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases and cash dividends 

recent acquisition 

on july 11 2012 we completed a voluntary tender offer for the outstanding shares of origio as at a purchase price of norwegian krone nok 28 per share in cash or 1474 million and acquired about 97 of the outstanding shares during our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 we acquired additional shares representing a total of 98 and in november 2012 we completed a mandatory redemption to obtain the remaining shares in accordance with the danish companies act cooper through its subsidiaries financed the acquisition with available offshore cash and credit facilities origio is a global invitro fertilization ivf medical device company that develops manufactures and distributes highly specialized products that target ivf treatment with a goal to make fertility treatment safer more efficient and convenient based in malov denmark origio has approximately 320 employees we assumed about 454 million of origios debt that we repaid concurrent with the acquisition our preliminary allocation of the purchase price at fair value includes amortizable intangible assets of 1077 million and goodwill of 955 million we incurred 49 million of acquisition costs which were reported as selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income see note 2 acquisitions

the contact lens market has two major product categories 

 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities 

the contact lens market consists primarily of disposable and frequently replaced lenses disposable lenses are designed for either daily twoweek or monthly replacement frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months significantly the market for spherical lenses is growing with valueadded spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 

coopervision’s proclear brand aspheric toric and multifocal contact lenses manufactured using pc technology help enhance tissuedevice compatibility and offer improved lens comfort 

coopervision’s biofinity brand silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses avaira brand spherical and toric products and our silicone hydrogel singleuse product are manufactured using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear we believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and singleuse silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major competitors 

coopervision net sales growth included increases in singleuse spheres up 10 representing 22 of net sales total toric lenses grew 5 and were 30 of net sales and multifocal lenses grew 26 to 8 of net sales up from 7 in the prior year silicone hydrogel products grew 28 worldwide and represented 36 of net sales up from 30 in the prior year proclear product sales were flat as compared to the prior year and represented 25 of net sales down from 27 in the prior year older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 16 and 20 respectively and together represented 3 of net sales down from 4 in the prior year 

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific 

coopervision net sales by geography 



coopervision’s worldwide net sales grew 6 in the yeartoyear comparison americas net sales grew 6 primarily due to market gains of coopervision’s silicone hydrogel lenses and singleuse lenses emea net sales grew 1 primarily driven by sales growth of silicone hydrogel lenses as sales in fiscal 2012 were negatively impacted due to the weakening euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar net sales to the asia pacific region grew 14 primarily due to sales growth in fiscal 2012 of singleuse lenses and silicone hydrogel lenses asia pacific net sales growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the japanese yen and australian dollar compared to the us dollar 

coopervision’s net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products primarily silicone hydrogel lenses while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision’s sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth

coopersurgicals fiscal 2011 net sales increased 12 from fiscal 2010 to 2097 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 8 sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 23 and represented 37 of coopersurgicals fiscal 2011 net sales compared to 33 in fiscal 2010 coopersurgical sales are primarily comprised of womens healthcare products used by gynecologists and obstetricians in both office and surgical procedures the balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of womens healthcare which coopersurgical does not actively market unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced organic sales growth

cost of salesgross profit 



the sequential increases in coopervision’s gross margin over the fiscal years presented are largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products coopervisions gross margin in fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by the 202 million reserve for inventory and return provisions related to the recall of certain lots of avaira contact lenses discussed above gross margin also reflects efficiencies associated with the 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan that was completed in the fiscal first quarter of 2011 there were no costs associated with this plan recorded in fiscal 2012 costs associated with the plan recorded as cost of sales were 19 million in fiscal 2011 and 160 million for fiscal 2010 

the increase in coopersurgical’s gross margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is largely attributable to manufacturing efficiency improvements and product mix the changes in product mix include higher margins on products used in surgical procedures that grew 19 over the prior year and represented 36 of net sales in fiscal 2012 or 40 excluding origio sales for the last four months of 2012 compared to 37 in fiscal 2011 and 33 in fiscal 2010 the increase was partially offset by the inclusion of four months of sales of lower margin ivf products from the acquisition of origio in july 2012 

selling general and administrative expense sga 



consolidated sga increased 10 in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and 18 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

the 6 increase in coopervisions sga in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars and the overall increase in sga as a percent of net sales from 35 in fiscal 2010 to 37 and 36 in fiscal 2011 and 2012 respectively is primarily due to our investment in sales and marketing including increased headcount to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products the growth in fiscal 2012 also includes increased general and administrative expenses primarily due to legal expenses and the growth in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 includes the 100 million patent litigation settlement discussed below 

the 32 increase in coopersurgicals sga in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as well as the increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to operating expenses related to origio as well as approximately 46 million of acquisition costs that were expensed fiscal 2012 sga was 34 as a percentage of net sales the same as fiscal 2011 excluding origio operating expenses and related acquisition costs in addition to the acquisition and integration activities related to origio coopersurgical continues to invest in sales activities to promote our products with emphasis on products used in surgical procedures and to support anticipated further growth the 15 increase in coopersurgical’s sga in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth together with legal expenses related to business acquisitions during the period 

corporate headquarters’ sga increased 19 in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased headcount sharebased compensation costs and legal expenses the 14 growth in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increased legal costs and sharebased compensation expense partially offset by reduced consulting fees 

research and development expense 



the sequential increases in coopervisions research and development expenses over the fiscal years presented and the fiscal 2012 increase as a percentage of net sales as compared to the prior two years are primarily due to investments in new technologies clinical trials and increased headcount coopervision’s research and development activities primarily include programs to develop singleuse and multifocal silicone hydrogel products 

coopersurgical research and development expense increased 43 in absolute dollars in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to investments in the design and upgrade of surgical procedure devices and the addition of origios invitro fertilization product development the 23 increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to investments in the design of the next generation product line of uterine manipulators 

amortization of intangibles 

amortization of intangibles was 240 million in fiscal 2012 205 million in fiscal 2011 and 181 million in fiscal 2010 the 17 increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to intangible assets from acquisitions including the acquisition of origio in july 2012 and those completed in fiscal 2011 

operating income 

operating income grew 935 million or 49 between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2012 increasing 558 million or 25 in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 and 377 million or 20 in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 



the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 15 partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of 11 coopersurgicals operating income increased in absolute dollars primarily due to the increase in gross profit that also includes the results of origio since july 2012 and operating income decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the 46 million of origio acquisition costs which were expensed as selling general and administrative expense

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 32 to 118 million in fiscal 2012 constituting 08 of net sales in fiscal 2012 as compared to 13 of net sales in fiscal 2011 the fiscal 2012 decrease reflects lower average debt and a reduction in our longterm borrowings used for capital expenditures together with lower interest rates as a result of the redemption of our 7125 senior notes in february 2011 interest expense decreased 53 as compared to fiscal 2010 to 173 million in 2011 and decreased 17 as compared to fiscal 2009 to 367 million in fiscal 2010 the fiscal 2011 decrease reflects lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our senior notes in february 2011 and lower average debt the fiscal 2010 decrease primarily reflects reduced longterm borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates we had 3463 million in loans under our credit agreement at october 31 2012 compared to 3397 million at october 31 2011 

insurance proceeds 

on october 28 2011 a manufacturing building in the uk experienced an incident in which a pipe broke in our fire suppression system causing water and fire retardant foam damage to the facility while this incident did not impact our existing customers the repairs to the facility and resultant decrease in manufacturing capacity impacted the timing of marketing initiatives we are in the process of discussing business interruption insurance claims with our insurer we received payments of 50  million in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 as an advance toward a full settlement recognized in our consolidated statement of income 

losses on extinguishment of debt 

in fiscal 2012 we recorded a 14 million loss related to the amendment to our credit agreement on may 31 2012 in fiscal 2011 we recorded a 165 million loss related to the repurchase of all outstanding 7125 senior notes that includes the writeoff of about 44 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of 121 million

other income expense net 



provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 268 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 173 million in fiscal 2011 our effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income for fiscal 2012 was 97 and for fiscal 2011 was 90 the increase in the etr is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income 

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the united states as a result the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income primarily within coopervision but augmented by coopersurigicals july 2012 acquisition of origio has decreased over recent fiscal periods a reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where the company operates are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states 

on april 1 2011 the internal revenue service irs issued a notice of deficiency to the company in connection with its audit of the company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 and 2006 the notice asserted that the company is subject to additional taxes due for its tax year 2005 under the antideferral provisions of subpart f of the internal revenue code a settlement concerning the 2005 claimed deficiency was subsequently reached with district counsel for the irs which effectively settled all related matters the decision document was filed with the us tax court on january 19 2012 with an agreed net deficiency of about 50 thousand 

sharebased compensation plans 

the company grants various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2012 was 228 million and 70 million respectively compared to 147 million and 44 million respectively in fiscal 2011 as of october 31 2012 there was 432 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 76 million for stock options 286 million for restricted stock units and 70 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 25 years for nonvested stock options 27 years for restricted stock units and 16 years for performance shares cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 was 551 million 820 million and 111 million respectively 

the company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2012 would have increased by approximately 2 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2012 would have increased by less than 1 

the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 

the company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period the company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates the company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively

2012 highlights 

 comparative statistics 



working capital 

the increase in working capital at the end of fiscal 2012 from the end of fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases in inventory accounts receivable cash and other current assets and the decrease in shortterm debt this increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

inventories of 581 million and trade accounts receivable of 50 million the 212 million decrease in cash flow provided by operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is due to the recognition in fiscal 2011 of noncash items primarily the loss on extinguishment of debt of 165 million and the accrued litigation settlement of 100 million as well as the fiscal 2012 increase in inventory and decrease in accrued expenses 

for fiscal 2012 our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities were for personnel and material costs along with cash payments of 106 million and 158 million for interest and income tax respectively and the 100 million single lumpsum payment accrued in fiscal 2011 to settle the rembrandt vision technologies lp lawsuit under the agreement reached on december 2 2011

in fiscal 2011 the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily related to borrowings and payments of debt and sharebased compensation awards cash used in financing activities of 1729 million in fiscal 2011 was driven by net repayments of debt of 2428 million including the redemption of all outstanding senior notes and the related redemption premium acquisition costs related to the credit agreement of 96 million a 26 million payment for contingent consideration and dividends paid on our common stock of 28 million offset by proceeds of 820 million from the exercise of sharebased compensation awards and 29 million for the excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments  coopervision and coopersurgical  reflecting the way that we manage our business 

in fiscal 2012 we performed a qualitative assessment to test each reporting units goodwill for impairment qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting each reporting unit based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed 

in fiscal 2011 the fair value of our reporting units was determined using the income valuation approach under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life in the application of the income approach the company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital we used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy the discount rates used in fiscal 2011 were about 100  basis points lower than those used in our analysis for fiscal 2010 reflecting the then current condition of the united states and global economy the company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of nearterm net sales expectations and longterm projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports as a sensitivity analysis a 100  basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2011 and extending through the valuation period for fiscal 2011 would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill 

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders equity and financial condition

acquired inprocess research and development the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements as of the acquisition date goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed direct acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 

 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of related accounting guidance for income taxes the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense 

 

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management 

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the companys stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the us treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the companys policy is to reduce to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into a limited number of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively the company does not emphasize such transactions to the same degree as some other companies with international operations the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 

we operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our products worldwide as a result our earnings cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables sales transactions capital expenditures and net investment in certain foreign operations we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange primarily to the british pound euro japanese yen danish krone swedish krona australian dollar and canadian dollar our policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical transaction remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the united states dollar would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations for additional information see item 1a risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility or credit agreement may vary with the london interbank offered rate libor we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through december 2014 

on may 31 2012 we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement originally entered into on january 12 2011 the aggregate commitment was increased to 10 billion from 7500 million and the 2344 million outstanding balance on the term loan was fully repaid using the amended credit agreement facility this facility offers additional availability lower interest rates and extends the maturity date to may 31 2017 from january 12 2016 in addition we have the ability to increase the facility by up to an additional 5000 million keybank led the refinancing with certain banks that participated in the credit agreement retaining or increasing their participation 

in february 2011 we redeemed all 3390 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7125 senior notes issued on january 31 2007 in accordance with the terms of the indenture from borrowings under the credit agreement in accordance with the indenture the redemption price for the notes was 103563 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to february 15 2011 the redemption date in fiscal 2011 we recorded a 165 million loss on the repurchase that includes the writeoff of about 44 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of 121 million related to the senior notes on our consolidated statement of income 



at october 31 2012 the scheduled maturities of the companys fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 



as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2012 it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2012 the company has interest rate swaps outstanding that are designed to fix the borrowing costs related to 2000 million of the outstanding balance on the companys revolving credit agreement if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about 15 million for further information about the companys debt see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 is a global medical device company publicly traded on the nyse euronext nyse coo cooper is dedicated to serving the needs of the healthcare professional and improving the quality of life for its employees and customers through its two business units coopervision inc and coopersurgical inc 

  

coopervision is a leading manufacturer of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market coopervision produces a broad range of monthly twoweek and singleuse contact lenses featuring advanced materials and optics coopervision brings a commitment to solving the toughest vision challenges such as astigmatism presbyopia and ocular dryness with a broad collection of spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses through a combination of innovative products and focused practitioner support coopervision brings a refreshing perspective to the marketplace coopervision’s products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico and new york coopervision distributes products from rochester new york fareham united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

  

coopersurgical is dedicated to providing medical devices and procedure solutions that improve healthcare delivery to women in any clinical setting coopersurgical focuses on expansion of its core businesses and the introduction of advanced technologybased products to aid clinicians in the management and treatment of commonly seen conditions coopersurgical customers are healthcare professionals and institutions providing care to and for women coopersurgical products support the point of healthcare delivery in the hospital clinicians office and fertility clinics coopersurgical’s major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in trumbull connecticut pasadena california stafford texas golden colorado and berlin germany 

  

coopervision and coopersurgical each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

coopervision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

  

   

   

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 

  

coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens 

  

market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently coopervision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips ™  a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility allows coopervision to compete in its markets by 

  

   

   

in addition coopervision lenses compete based on providing superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology coopervision lenses have a round to partial round edge which we believe increases comfort coopervision’s proclear ® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates phosphorylcholine pc technology ™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses in the past three years coopervision launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products under our biofinity ® brand and twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our avaira ® brand in fiscal 2011 we launched our biofinity spherical silicone hydrogel lens in japan and our biofinity multifocal lens globally 

  

in addition to its pc technology ™ and silicone hydrogel product offerings coopervision competes in the contact lens market with its traditional hydrogel products 

  

contact lens product sales 

  

spheres net sales of coopervision’s spherical lenses representing 61 percent of coopervision’s soft lens net sales grew 12 percent in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 singleuse spherical lens net sales representing 23 percent of soft lens sales grew 18 percent 

  

toric and multifocal net sales of coopervision’s toric lenses representing 31 percent of coopervision’s soft lens net sales grew 16 percent in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 multifocal lens net sales representing 7 percent of soft lens net sales grew 4 percent in fiscal 2011 

  

proclear net sales of coopervision’s pc technology products – which consist of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics ® xc and proclear ® 1 day – increased 10 percent in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and represented 28 percent of coopervision’s soft lens net sales 

  

silicone hydrogel coopervision’s silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products grew 49 percent in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and represented 31 percent of coopervision’s soft lens net sales as compared to 24 percent in fiscal 2010 

  

contact lens product sales by geographic region 

  

based on our knowledge of the contact lens market and our review of available independent market data for calendar year 2010 we estimate the worldwide market for contact lenses by modality is 34 percent singleuse 36 percent twoweek and 30 percent monthly we estimate that the americas market representing about 38 percent of the worldwide soft contact lens market by modality is 13 percent singleuse 58 percent twoweek and 29 percent monthly emea representing about 29 percent of the worldwide market is 38 percent singleuse 12 percent twoweek and 50 percent monthly and asia pacific representing about 33 percent of the worldwide market is 55 percent singleuse 33 percent twoweek and 12 percent monthly 

  

coopervision competition 

  

the contact lens market is highly competitive coopervision’s three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

recent trends in marketing spherical lenses include a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses and toward singleuse lenses coopervision’s primary competitors currently control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market coopervision was late in entering the silicone hydrogel segment of the market but has increased sales of its monthly and twoweek toric and spherical lens offerings as well as the recently introduced monthly multifocal lens in japan coopervision recently launched biofinity sphere our monthly spherical silicone hydrogel lens 

  

in the toric lens market we believe that lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners coopervision competes based on its three manufacturing processes yielding wider ranges of toric lens parameters providing wide choices for patient and practitioner and superior visual acuity as well as by offering excellent customer service including high standards of ontime product delivery 

  

coopervision’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces coopervision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the company’s lens products 

  

coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects coopervision believes that its contact lenses will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share coopervision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses 

  

coopervision developments with the us food and drug administration 

  

in august 2011 coopervision initiated a recall on limited lots of avaira ® toric contact lenses in november 2011 this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of avaira sphere contact lenses the 

  

recall was initiated because of the level of a residue silicone oil on certain lenses the residue may cause hazy vision severe eye pain or an eye injury the manufacturing issue has been identified and process changes have been implemented these process changes are subject to review by the united states food and drug administration fda avaira toric and avaira sphere lenses that are subject to the recall represent less than 2 of the company’s fiscal 2011 net sales avaira sphere lenses remain on the market while avaira toric lenses are awaiting fda authorization to return to the market this recall is limited solely to specific lots of avaira toric and avaira sphere contact lenses and no other coopervision products are involved in this recall 

  

separately coopervision’s distribution center in west henrietta new york was recently inspected by the fda and on december 7 2011 we received a warning letter dated december 5 2011 stating that certain labeling and packaging operations conducted at the facility deviate from applicable current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements we are working with the fda to address the observations cited in the warning letter the warning letter does not restrict or prohibit the sale or marketing of our products nor does it require us to recall any products distributed from the center however if we fail to correct the observations to fda’s satisfaction we could be subject to an enforcement action such as a seizure fdamandated recall or other operating restrictions on the coopervision facility 

  

coopersurgical 

  

coopersurgical offers a broad array of products used in the care and treatment of women’s health the company participates in the women’s healthcare market through offering quality products innovative technologies and superior service to clinicians worldwide coopersurgical collaborates with clinicians to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to sophisticated instruments and equipment the result is a broad portfolio of proven products that aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that healthcare professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of women’s health issues 

  

since its inception in 1990 coopersurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model 

  

market for women’s healthcare 

  

coopersurgical participates in the market for women’s healthcare with its diversified product lines of over 600 products coopersurgical products are in three major categories based on the point of healthcare delivery hospitals obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns medical offices and fertility clinics 

  

based on united states census estimates coopersurgical expects patient visits to united states obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is an increasing base of reproductive age women a large and stable middleaged population and a rapidly growing population of women over the age of 65 coopersurgical believes that the resurgence of population growth in the reproductive age group will result in increased office visits related to birth control and childbearing coopersurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond office visit activity related to menopausal problems including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade 

  

coopersurgical believes that in the past clinicians primarily saw women only during their reproductive years now with new treatment options available and a more educated population coopersurgical expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later 

  

another trend in the market for women’s healthcare includes the migration of obgyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and towards aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health systems coopersurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the nearterm 

  

while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

coopersurgical’s fiscal 2011 net sales growth 

  

during fiscal 2011 coopersurgical’s net sales grew 12 percent to 2097 million from 1880 million in fiscal 2010 representing 16 percent of cooper’s net sales in both periods net sales growth excluding acquisitions was 8 percent sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 23 percent and represented 37 percent of coopersurgical’s total net sales as compared to 33 percent in fiscal 2010 

  

coopersurgical competition 

  

coopersurgical focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances coopersurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure coopersurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

  

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and 

  

hospitals coopersurgical competes based on its sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of its products coopersurgical’s strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as coopersurgical expands its product line it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

  

coopersurgical is seeking to expand its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnson’s ethicon endosurgery and ethicon women’s health and urology companies boston scientific gyrus acmi and covidien these competitors have well established positions within the operating room environment coopersurgical intends to leverage its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate its expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

  

research and development 

  

cooper employs 194 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments most of these employees are in coopervision coopervision product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry clinical trials microbiology and biochemistry coopervision’s research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing pc technology 

  

coopersurgical conducts research and development inhouse and also has consulting agreements with external surgical specialists coopersurgical’s research and development activities include the design of the next generation product line of uterine manipulators the upgrade and expansion of coopersurgical’s portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings 

  

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were 436 million 353 million and 303 million respectively net of acquired inprocess research and development of 30 million in 2009 net research and development expenditures represented 3 percent of net sales each fiscal year during fiscal 2011 coopervision represented 85 percent and coopersurgical represented 15 percent of the total research and development expenses we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs during fiscal 2009 – 2011 

  

government regulation 

  

medical device regulation 

  

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

  

device classification 

  

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes – class i ii or iii – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both coopervision and coopersurgical develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of coopersurgical’s products are class ii devices 

  

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda’s general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda’s quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

  

class ii devices are subject to the fda’s general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

  

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

  

510k clearance pathway 

  

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

  

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a 

  

manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

  

premarket approval pathway 

  

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

  

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

  

clinical trials 

  

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans outweighs the risks and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

  

continuing fda regulation 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their 

  

device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

  

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion can result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

foreign regulation 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there the worldwide medical device regulations are increasing with many countries becoming regulated for the first time for example hong kong singapore and malaysia are becoming regulated and follow the global harmonization task force model for regulating medical devices these emerging regulated countries require the same rigorous safety data compiled in preclinical and clinical studies for the rest of the world japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

other health care regulation 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws and laws pertaining to healthcare privacy 

  

and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

raw materials 

  

coopervision’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however coopervision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products in fiscal 2011 coopervision purchased certain assets of asahikasei aime co ltd aime our current sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products from asahi kasei pharma corporation while this acquisition has increased coopervision’s control over the sourcing of certain raw materials if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

  

raw materials used by coopersurgical are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

  

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens business coopervision faces intense competition from competitors’ products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb inc have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than coopervision they also offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the americas emea and asia pacific and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to a lesser extent coopervision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

  

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that our competitors’ newer contact lens products will not successfully erode coopervision’s contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in the women’s healthcare market competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

  

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

  

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at coopersurgical we intend to 

  

continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence 

  

product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which coopervision competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which coopersurgical competes historically we did not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others however since 2005 we have been investing more in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

  

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve 

  

market acceptance or generate operating profits in addition we have been slower to introduce new silicone hydrogel contact lens products than our competitors which put these products at a competitive disadvantage market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

  

technological developments in the eye care and women’s healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our current operations for coopervision are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately twothirds of our net sales for coopervision for the fiscal years ended october 31 2011 and 2010 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

  

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

  

in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as high energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market foreign countries in particular the euro zone are affected by similar systemic impacts as a result we continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in fiscal 2012 

  

continued turbulence in the united states and international market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to 

  

be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 

  

coopervision manufactures molded contact lenses which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico coopersurgical manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

  

coopervision distributes products out of west henrietta new york the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities our distribution center in west henrietta new york was recently inspected by fda and on december 7 2011 we received a warning letter dated december 5 2011 stating that certain labeling and packaging operations conducted at the facility deviate from applicable cgmp requirements we are working with the fda to address the observations cited in the warning letter the warning letter does not restrict or prohibit the sale or marketing of our products nor does it require us to recall any products distributed from the center however if we fail to correct the observations to the fda’s satisfaction we could be subject to an enforcement action such as a seizure fdamandated recall or other operating restrictions on the facility that could have a material adverse effect on our business coopersurgical’s products are primarily distributed out of its facility in trumbull connecticut any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted and our product sales and profitability could suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fda’s cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a cgmp qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of 

  

products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability we are currently working with the fda to address a warning letter dated december 5 2011 which was issued by the fda following an inspection of the labeling and packaging operations performed at our distribution center in west henrietta new york if we fail to resolve the observations cited in the warning letter to the fda’s satisfaction we would be subject to the foregoing regulatory enforcement actions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice we have purchased asahikasei aime co ltd to achieve greater control over certain of the raw materials used in our silicone hydrogel contact lenses however asahikasei finechem asahi remains our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products biofinity and avaira we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if asahi or other suppliers fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier a disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

  

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

  

   

   

   

   

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since 

  

publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

  

we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable certain patents protecting our proclear line of products expired in fiscal year 2011 which allows competitors to market and sell products with similar attributes 

  

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

  

the laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

  

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

  

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

  

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

  

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

  

we face risks related to environmental matters 

  

our facilities are subject to a broad range of united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

  

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

  

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound sterling euro japanese yen and canadian dollar we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely these hedges may also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis 

  

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws in addition the internal revenue service irs issued a notice of deficiency in connection with its audit of the company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 and 2006 the notice asserts that the company is subject to additional taxes due to a proposed adjustment under the antideferral provisions of subpart f of the internal revenue code if sustained such taxes should be offset by the company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards leaving a 12 million balance of proposed taxes owed the company intends to defend its positions taken in its income tax returns vigorously however if the irs’s contentions were sustained the company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards could be materially reduced which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s future net income we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results for example the recently enacted health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 imposes a new excise tax of 23 percent of the price for which certain medical devices are sold coopervision is not affected by this new tax almost all of coopersurgical’s sales will be subject to this new tax that takes effect january 1 2013 we cannot at this time anticipate the magnitude of this new tax that would be imposed on us as there are significant uncertainties concerning key definitions and terms within the law 

  

volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs 

  

we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the united states this defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other investments changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 

  

we manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

  

we utilize complex computer systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in 

  

place that keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

  

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

  

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

  

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

  

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

  

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

  

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s design development testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

  

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products for example the fda has recently been reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510k program in january 2011 the fda announced a plan of action that included twentyfive action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent since then the fda has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs some of these changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances for our products increase the cost of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

  

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

  

in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing 

  

regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms’ quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

  

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fda’s qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture medical device manufacturers such as coopervision and coopersurgical may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found for example in august of 2011 coopervision in collaboration with the fda initiated a recall of limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses which in november of 2011 was expanded to include limited lots of avaira sphere contact lenses this recall is ongoing and requires authorization of the fda to return the avaira toric product to market recalls of any of our products including any expansion of the ongoing avaira recall may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall including the ongoing avaira recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers which could reduce the sales of our products in addition the fda or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business and financial results 

  

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors’ efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the united states federal and state governments in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to collectively as the health care reform law the health care reform law makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the health care reform law of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

these measures could result in decreased net revenues from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts many of the details regarding the implementation of the health care reform law are yet to be determined and at this time it remains unclear the full effect that the health care reform law would have on our business 

  

also any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches in addition we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

  

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule 

  

requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

  

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the america’s recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under the hitech act certain of hipaa’s privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities’ business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions 

  

while we do not believe that we are a covered entity or a business associate under hipaa many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information as defined by hipaa we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information pursuant to the hitech act if the government determines that we are a business associate we could be additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and new legal and regulatory requirements and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws indeed recent changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have already required us to alter certain of our 

  

compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws the advanced medical technology association advamed a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers has also recently released a revised code of ethics outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals this code became effective july 1 2009 these laws regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

  

in addition the recent health care reform law among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the health care reform law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

  

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

results of operations 

  

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

  

outlook 

  

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by employment housing and credit concerns the european debt crisis and the recent downgrade of longterm us sovereign debt continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2012 and beyond 

  

we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine pc technology ™ and silicone hydrogel aquaform ® technology we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets 

  

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly in the past three years coopervision launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products under our biofinity ® brand and twoweek silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our avaira brand in fiscal 2011 we launched our biofinity spherical silicone hydrogel lens in japan and our biofinity multifocal lens globally while we believe that we have high quality silicone hydrogel contact lens products our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market for example competitive silicone hydrogel singleuse and multifocal lens products are gaining market share and represent a risk to our business we have not yet marketed a silicone hydrogel singleuse product our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability 

  

in august 2011 coopervision initiated a recall on limited lots of avaira toric contact lenses in november 2011 this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of avaira sphere contact lenses the recall was initiated because of the level of a residue silicone oil on certain lenses the residue may cause hazy vision severe eye pain or an eye injury the manufacturing issue has been identified and process changes have been implemented these process changes are subject to review by the united states food and drug administration avaira toric and avaira sphere lenses that are subject to the

recall represent less than 2 of the company’s fiscal 2011 net sales avaira sphere lenses remain on the market while avaira toric lenses are awaiting fda authorization to return to the market this recall is limited solely to specific lots of avaira toric and avaira sphere contact lenses and no other coopervision products are involved in this recall 

  

we are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance coopervision’s worldwide product lines new products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and pc technology ™ materials and new lens designs including multifocal and singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses 

  

the medical device segment of the women’s healthcare market is highly fragmented coopersurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model in fiscal 2011 coopersurgical acquired apple medical gaining its products including the obmobius ® elastic retractor used in cesarean sections the fischer cone biopsy excisor ™ used for cervical biopsies and the applehunt secondary trocar ™ used in laparoscopic surgical procedures coopersurgical also acquired summit doppler systems inc gaining its handheld obstetrical and vascular ultrasound doppler systems used for peripheral vascular testing and fetal monitoring applications we intend to continue to invest in coopersurgical’s business through acquisitions of companies and product lines 

  

in the fiscal first quarter of 2011 we refinanced our syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit due to mature on january 31 2012 with a new credit agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 7500 million and an amortizing term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 2500 million each of which mature on january 12 2016 on february 15 2011 we redeemed all 3390 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture from borrowings under the new credit agreement including 2500 million from the term loan facility at october 31 2011 we had 6507 million available under the credit agreement we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and longterm cash requirements for capital expenditures acquisitions and cash dividends

coopervision net sales 

  

the contact lens market has two major product categories 

  

   

   

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules often defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly coopervision offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities 

  

the contact lens market consists primarily of disposable and frequently replaced lenses disposable lenses are designed for either daily twoweek or monthly replacement frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months significantly the market for spherical lenses is growing with valueadded spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 

  

coopervision’s proclear ® brand aspheric toric and multifocal contact lenses manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine pc technology help enhance tissuedevice compatibility and offer improved lens comfort 

  

coopervision’s biofinity brand silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses and avaira brand spherical and toric products are manufactured using proprietary aquaform technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear we believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and singleuse silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major competitors 

  

net sales growth includes increases in singleuse spheres up 18 and total spheres up 12 total toric lenses grew 16 including 26 growth of singleuse toric lenses and multifocal lenses grew 4 silicone hydrogel products grew 49 worldwide proclear products increased 10 driven by growth of singleuse lenses older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 13 and 17 respectively

coopervision net sales by region 

  

   

coopervision’s worldwide net sales grew 16 in the periodtoperiod comparison americas net sales grew 9 primarily due to market gains of coopervision’s silicone hydrogel contact lenses and singleuse lenses in our fiscal first quarter of 2010 we recorded 101 million of reductions to americas net sales due to outofperiod adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were underaccrued in fiscal 2009 emea net sales grew 13 driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses and singleuse lenses net sales to the asia pacific region grew 36 primarily due to sales growth of singleuse spherical and toric products and silicone hydrogel lenses these results include sales of 313 million related to product lines acquired on december 1 2010 from asahikasei aime co ltd 

  

coopervision’s net sales growth is driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products primarily silicone hydrogel lenses along with acquisitions and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations while unit growth and product mix have influenced coopervision’s sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth 

  

coopersurgical net sales 

  

coopersurgical’s fiscal 2011 net sales increased 12 from fiscal 2010 to 2097 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 8 sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 23 and represented 37 of coopersurgical’s fiscal 2011 net sales compared to 33 in the prior fiscal year coopersurgical sales are primarily comprised of women’s healthcare products used by gynecologists and obstetricians in both office and surgical procedures the balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare which coopersurgical does not actively market unit growth and product mix along with increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced organic sales growth

cost of salesgross profit 

  

   

the increases in coopervision’s gross margin are largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products coopervision’s gross margin in the current year was negatively impacted by the 202 million reserve for inventory and return provisions related to the recall of certain lots of avaira contact lenses discussed above gross margin also reflects efficiencies associated with the 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan costs associated with the plan recorded as cost of sales were 19 million for fiscal 2011 160 million for fiscal 2010 and 50 million for fiscal 2009 as discussed below these costs are primarily severance charges and accelerated depreciation and we do not expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan in future periods gross margin for fiscal 2010 reflects the increase in accruals for rebates discussed above gross margin in fiscal 2009 included costs associated with fixed asset write offs such costs were not significant in fiscal 2011 or 2010

the 20 increase in coopervision’s sga in fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of net sales are primarily due to our increased investment in sales and marketing to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products as well as the patent infringement settlement discussed below 

  

the 15 increase in coopersurgical’s sga in fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of sales are primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth along with legal expenses related to business acquisitions during the period 

  

corporate headquarters’ sga increased 14 in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased legal costs and sharebased compensation expense partially offset by reduced consulting fees

restructuring costs 

  

2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan 

  

in the fiscal third quarter of 2009 coopervision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from norfolk virginia and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from adelaide australia to existing manufacturing operations in juana diaz puerto rico and hamble uk 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan this plan is intended to better utilize coopervision’s manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees 

  

coopervision completed restructuring activities in adelaide in our fiscal third quarter of 2010 and in norfolk in our fiscal first quarter of 2011 

  

the total restructuring costs under this plan were approximately 231 million with 154 million associated with assets including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs and 77 million associated with employee benefit costs including severance payments termination benefit costs retention bonus payouts and other similar costs these costs were reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of income 

  

in fiscal 2011 19 million including 08 million of employee benefit costs and 11 million of costs associated with assets primarily noncash were reported in cost of sales in fiscal 2010 161 million including 33 million of employee benefit costs and 128 million of costs associated with assets primarily noncash were reported as 160 million in cost of sales and 01 million in restructuring costs in fiscal 2009 51 million including 36 million of employee benefit costs and 15 million of noncash costs associated with assets were reported as 50 million in cost of sales and 01 million in restructuring costs

operating income 

  

operating income grew 777 million or 52 between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011 increasing 377 million or 20 in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 and 400 million or 27 in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 

  

   

the increase in consolidated operating income in fiscal 2011 both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 19 partially offset by increases in operating expenses of 19 the avaira recall discussed above and the settlement with rembrandt discussed below 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 53 to 173 million in 2011 constituting 1 of net sales in fiscal 2011 as compared to 3 of net sales in the fiscal 2010 the fiscal 2011 decrease reflects lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our senior notes in february 2011 and lower average debt in the current period interest expense decreased 17 to 367 million in fiscal 2010 and decreased 17 to 441 million in 2009 the fiscal 2010 and 2009 decreases primarily reflect reduced longterm borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates we had 3397 million in loans on our credit agreement at october 31 2011 compared to 5918 million at october 31 2010 

  

extinguishment of debt 

  

in february 2011 we redeemed all 3390 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes issued on january 31 2007 in accordance with the indenture the redemption price for the notes was 103563 of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to february 15 2011 the redemption date in our fiscal second quarter of 2011 we recorded a 165 million loss on the repurchase that includes the writeoff of approximately 44 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of 121 million related to the senior notes in our consolidated statement of income the company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under its new credit agreement including 2500 million from the term loan facility

settlements 

  

on december 2 2011 coopervision and rembrandt vision technologies lp entered into a settlement agreement whereby coopervision agreed to make a lump sum payment of 100 million to rembrandt and rembrandt granted a covenant not to sue regarding patent infringement claims the company recorded a charge for the settlement in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 

  

the company and several of its directors and officers had been named in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit the nature and status of which is described in note 12 commitments and contingencies the company announced on may 4 2010 that it reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter of 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for 270 million which we funded into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 the court granted final approval of the proposed settlement on december 13 2010 

  

the company also was a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative litigation against several current and former officers and directors of the company the company reached a settlement agreement to pay attorney’s fees of counsel to the plaintiff’s in the amount of 750 thousand the company recorded a charge for the settlement amount in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 

  

other loss income net 

  

   

the fiscal 2009 foreign exchange net gain is primarily due to the us dollar strengthening against other currencies and an initiative we completed in the quarter related to intercompany transactions 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 173 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 116 million in fiscal 2010 cooper’s effective tax rate etr provision for income taxes divided by pretax income for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 was about 9 

  

the etr is below the united states statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the united states as a result the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income primarily within coopervision has decreased over recent fiscal periods a reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where the company operates are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the united states the completion of the company’s restructuring plan to close a coopervision manufacturing facility located in norfolk virginia with the manufacturing demand subsequently

absorbed by our plants in the united kingdom and puerto rico contributed to this change in the geographic mix of income as a result of this restructuring substantially all of coopervision’s contact lens products are manufactured outside of the united states 

  

additionally in fiscal 2011 the company recorded a 165 million domestic loss on the repurchase of its senior notes that included the write off of about 44 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of 121 million this impacted the company’s tax provision and further reduced the overall effective tax rate 

  

sharebased compensation plans 

  

the company grants various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2011 was 147 million and 44 million respectively compared to 102 million and 32 million respectively in fiscal 2010 as of october 31 2011 there was 324 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost related to nonvested awards 72 million for stock options 190 million for restricted stock units and 62 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 27 years for nonvested stock options 29 years for restricted stock units and 18 years for performance shares cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 was 820 million 111 million and 11 million respectively 

  

the company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2011 would have increased by approximately 150 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2011 would have increased by less than 1 

  

the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed these adjustments totaled 19 million 12 million and 29 million in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals over a threeyear period the company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current

market price of our common stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates the company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively

comparative statistics 

  

   

working capital 

  

the decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2011 from the end of fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increases in accounts payable other accrued liabilities including the charge related to the rembrandt settlement and shortterm debt including the portion of the term loan which became current during the fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable inventory and a decrease in accrued interest payable the decrease in accrued interest payable was due to lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our senior notes in february 2011 lower average outstanding debt and the timing of interest payments 

  

the increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory were primarily due to the growth in sales and to production to support new product launches at october 31 2011 cooper’s inventory months on hand moh were 59 excluding the reserves for inventory related to the recall of certain lots of

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments – coopervision and coopersurgical – reflecting the way that we manage our business 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

the fair value of our reporting units was determined using the income valuation approach under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 

  

in the application of the income approach the company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital we used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy the discount rates used in the current year are about 100 basis points lower than those used in our analysis for fiscal year 2010 reflecting the current condition of the united states and global economy the company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of nearterm net sales expectations and longterm projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports as a sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2011 and extending through the valuation period would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders’ equity and financial condition 

  

   

during the fiscal third quarter of 2011 we recorded an outofperiod adjustment related to coopervision’s acquisition of certain assets of asahikasei aime co ltd aime reported in our fiscal first quarter of 2011 to reduce the amount of recorded goodwill and reverse the 61 million gain on settlement of preexisting relationship the company determined that it incorrectly applied the guidance in asc 805 business combinations  relating to the settlement of preexisting relationships due to our interpretation of specific language in the underlying contract based upon an evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors and after considering the

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

  

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of asc 740 accounting for income taxes  the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the us treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

  

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

  

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 is a global medical products company that serves the specialty healthcare market through its two business units coopervision inc cvi and coopersurgical inc csi 

  

cvi develops manufactures and markets a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market dedicated to enhancing the contact lens experience for practitioners and patients cvi specializes in lenses for astigmatism presbyopia and ocular dryness cvi is a leading manufacturer of toric lenses which correct astigmatism multifocal lenses for presbyopia blurring near vision due to advancing age and spherical lenses that correct the most common visual defects cvi’s products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico and new york cvi distributes products from rochester new york fareham united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

  

csi develops manufactures and markets medical devices diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians csi’s major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in trumbull connecticut pasadena california stafford texas and berlin germany 

  

cvi and csi each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

cvi competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific the contact lens market has two major product categories 

  

   

   

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules otherwise defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 

  

cvi offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in all primary modalities we believe that in order to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility allows us to compete in our markets by 

  

   

   

in addition cvi lenses compete based on providing superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology cvi lenses have a round to partial round edge which we believe increases comfort cooper’s proclear ® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates a proprietary phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

the contact lens market has in recent years experienced a shift toward contact lenses made from silicone hydrogel materials silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses the use of these materials in contact lenses has grown significantly and this material is a major product material in the industry cvi has launched the third generation of silicone hydrogel spherical contact lens products under our brands biofinity ® and avaira ® in the united states europe and asia pacific excluding japan we also launched a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens under the biofinity brand in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 we launched two silicone hydrogel lenses the biofinity multifocal lens and the avaira toric lens 

  

in addition to its silicone hydrogel and pc technology™ product offerings cvi competes in the contact lens market with its singleuse products and with traditional hydrogel products 

  

contact lens product sales 

  

spheres net sales of cvi’s spherical lenses representing 61 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales grew 9 percent in the year ended october 31 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 singleuse sphere net sales which grew 12 percent represented 22 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales 

  

toric and multifocal cvi’s toric lens net sales grew 13 percent in fiscal 2010 representing 31 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales as compared to fiscal 2009 multifocal lens sales grew only 1 percent in fiscal 2010 this was primarily due to a trend in the market toward silicone hydrogel multifocal lenses and cvi’s late entry with biofinity multifocal our silicone hydrogel offering 

  

proclear net sales of cvi’s pc technology products – which consist of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics ® xc and proclear 1 day – increased 9 percent in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and represented 29 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales proclear 1 day cvi’s proclear singleuse offering grew 58 percent from fiscal 2009 

  

silicone hydrogel cvi’s silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products grew 108 percent in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and represented 24 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales as compared to 12 percent in fiscal 2009 

  

contact lens product sales by geographic region 

  

based on our knowledge of the contact lens market and our review of independent market data we estimate the worldwide market for contact lenses by modality is 34 percent singleuse 36 percent 

  

twoweek and 30 percent monthly we estimate that the americas market representing about 38 percent of the worldwide soft contact lens market by modality is 13 percent singleuse 58 percent twoweek and 29 percent monthly emea representing about 31 percent of the worldwide market is 38 percent singleuse 12 percent twoweek and 50 percent monthly and asia pacific representing about 31 percent of the worldwide market is 55 percent singleuse 33 percent twoweek and 12 percent monthly 

  

cvi competition 

  

the contact lens market is highly competitive cvi’s three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

recent trends in marketing spherical lenses include a shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses primarily in the united states europe and japan and toward singleuse lenses cvi’s primary competitors currently control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market cvi was late in entering the silicone hydrogel segment of the market but has increased sales of its monthly and twoweek toric and spherical lens offerings as well as the recently introduced monthly multifocal lens in japan cvi has recently received regulatory approval to sell a silicone hydrogel product 

  

in the toric lens market we believe that lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners cvi competes based on its three manufacturing processes yielding wider ranges of toric lens parameters providing wide choices for patient and practitioner and superior visual acuity as well as by offering excellent customer service including high standards of ontime product delivery 

  

cvi’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces cvi seeks to offer a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the company’s lens products 

  

cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects cvi believes that its contact lenses will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share cvi also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses 

  

coopersurgical 

  

since its beginning in 1990 csi has sought to be a leader in providing medical device products to the obstetrics and gynecology medical specialty historically many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system csi’s strategy continues to be to identify and acquire selected companies and product lines that will improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas csi has grown to 1880 million in net sales both organically and through a series of more than 25 acquisitions 

  

market for women’s healthcare 

  

csi participates in the market for women’s healthcare with its diversified product lines of over 600 products these products are in three major categories obgyn medical offices surgical procedures including hospitals clinics and surgical centers and fertility 

  

based on united states census estimates csi expects patient visits to united states obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is an increasing base of reproductive age women a large and stable middleaged population and a rapidly growing population of women over the age of 65 csi believes that the resurgence of population growth in the reproductive age group will result in increased office visits related to birth control and childbearing csi expects growth in fertility treatments as more women choose to delay childbearing to the midthirties and beyond office visit activity related to menopausal problems including abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade csi believes that in the past clinicians primarily saw women only during their reproductive years now with new treatment options available and a more educated population csi expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later 

  

while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

csi’s fiscal 2010 net sales growth 

  

during fiscal 2010 csi’s net sales grew 10 percent to 1880 million from 1709 million in fiscal 2009 representing 16 percent of cooper’s net sales in both periods csi’s organic growth was 6 percent sales of products used in surgical procedures grew 18 percent and represented 33 percent of csi’s total net sales as compared to 31 percent in fiscal 2009 

  

csi competition 

  

csi focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances csi offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure csi believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

  

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi competes based on its sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of its products csi’s strategy includes developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as csi expands its product line it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

  

csi is seeking to expand its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as johnson  johnson’s ethicon endosurgery and ethicon women’s health and urology companies boston scientific gyrus acmi and covidien these competitors have well established positions within the operating room environment csi intends to leverage its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery to facilitate its expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

  

research and development 

  

cooper employs 164 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments most of these employees are in cvi cvi product development and clinical research is supported by internal and external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry clinical trials microbiology and biochemistry cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop silicone hydrogel products product lines utilizing pc technology and expansion of singleuse product lines 

  

csi conducts research and development inhouse and also has consulting agreements with external surgical specialists csi’s fiscal 2010 research and development activities were for the upgrade and redesign of existing incontinence assisted reproductive technology and uterine manipulation products 

  

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were 353 million 303 million and 355 million respectively net of acquired inprocess research and development of 30 million in 2009 net research and development expenditures represented 3 percent of net sales each fiscal year during fiscal 2010 cvi represented 85 percent and csi represented 15 percent of the total research and development expenses we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs 

  

government regulation 

  

medical device regulation 

  

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage 

  

recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur 

  

device classification 

  

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes – class i ii or iii – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require lower levels of regulation the majority of csi’s products are class ii devices 

  

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda’s general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda’s quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

  

class ii devices are subject to the fda’s general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

  

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

  

510k clearance pathway 

  

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

  

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained in these circumstances a manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

  

premarket approval pathway 

  

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 

  

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information including clinical data or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

  

clinical trials 

  

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans outweighs the risks and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

  

continuing fda regulation 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

  

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion can result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

foreign regulation 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there the worldwide medical device regulations are increasing with many countries becoming regulated for the first time for example hong kong singapore and malaysia are becoming regulated and follow the global harmonization task force model for regulating medical devices these emerging regulated countries require the same rigorous safety data compiled in preclinical and clinical studies for the rest of the world japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires incountry clinical trials the japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated japanese regulations 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 13485 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market the iso 13485 quality 

  

measurement system registration is now also required for registration of products in asia pacific and latin american countries in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

other health care regulation 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws and laws pertaining to healthcare privacy and security violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws as applicable to us because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

raw materials 

  

cvi’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source however cvi relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products on december 1 2010 cvi purchased certain assets of asahikasei aime co ltd aime our current sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products from asahi kasei pharma corporation while this acquisition has increased cvi’s control over the sourcing of certain raw materials if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products 

  

raw materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

marketing and distribution 

  

cvi markets its products in the united states through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors cvi augments its united states sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in professional journals in the emea and asia pacific regions cvi primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries cvi uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products within specific geographic areas 

  

csi’s products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives independent agents and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows professional educational programs and internet promotions including ecommerce social media and collaborative efforts with professional organizations telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

  

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

  

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of cooper’s products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper intends to protect its intellectual property rights aggressively 

  

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than 

  

   

   

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

  

dependence on customers 

  

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 

  

government contracts 

  

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

  

backlog 

  

backlog is not a material factor in either of cooper’s business units 

  

seasonality 

  

cvi’s contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

  

compliance with environmental laws 

  

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect cooper’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

  

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens segment cvi faces intense competition from competitors’ products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than cvi they also offer competitive products and differentiated materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses the market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully on a timely basis in the united states europe and japan and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to a lesser extent cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

  

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that our competitors’ newer contact lens products will not successfully erode cvi’s contact lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in the women’s healthcare segment competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

  

acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks 

  

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at csi we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence 

  

product innovations are important in the contact lens business in which cvi competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which csi competes historically we did not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others however since 2005 we have been investing more in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies such as contact lenses with antimicrobial or antiallergenic features that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

  

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits in addition we have been slower to introduce new silicone hydrogel contact lens products than our competitors which put these products at a competitive disadvantage market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

  

technological developments in the eye care and women’s healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our current operations for cvi are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately twothirds of our net sales for cvi for the fiscal years ended october 31 2010 and 2009 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

  

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

  

in the united states and globally market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as high energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market foreign countries are affected by similar systemic impacts we continue to experience slower than historical growth in contact lens sales particularly in the us and continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in 2011 

  

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may again be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads continued turbulence in the united states and international market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions return they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 

  

cvi manufactures molded contact lenses which represent a significant portion of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico csi manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

  

cvi distributes products out of rochester new york the united kingdom belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities csi’s products are primarily distributed out of its facility in trumbull connecticut any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted and our product sales and profitability could suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fda’s cgmp for medical devices known as the qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a cgmp qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice we have purchased asahikasei aime co ltd to achieve greater control over certain of the raw materials used in our silicone hydrogel contact lenses however asahikasei finechem asahi remains our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products biofinity and avaira we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason andor we need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi a disruption in the supply of comfilcon a could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

  

if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately our business could suffer 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

  

   

   

   

   

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage we also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

  

we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable certain patents protecting our proclear line of products will expire in fiscal year 2011 which will allow competitors to market and sell products with similar attributes upon such expiration we will lose some competitive advantage if we are unable to maintain the proprietary trade secret nature of our technologies 

  

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks we also might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

  

the laws of other foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others 

  

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products claims that our products business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products incorporating our technology 

  

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry third parties have made and may make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

  

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

  

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

  

we face risks related to environmental matters 

  

our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

  

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

  

our indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit facility and senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

  

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the pound sterling euro japanese yen and canadian dollar we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely these hedges may also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis 

  

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws in addition the internal revenue service irs has been auditing the company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 – 2007 and we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results the recently enacted health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 imposes a new excise tax on medical device companies starting with us domestic sales made after december 31 2012 while cvi is not affected csi will likely be affected by this new tax we cannot at this time anticipate the magnitude of this new tax that would be imposed on us as there are significant uncertainties concerning key definitions and terms within the law 

  

we manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are regularly maintained and upgraded an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs 

  

we utilize complex computer systems including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems to support our business units and we have a continuous improvement strategy in place that keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and expected we employ controlled change management methodologies to plan test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance support andor upgrade of these systems 

  

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

  

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

  

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we also have the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 that expires on october 29 2017 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquiror to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

  

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

  

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

  

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s design development testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

  

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

  

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance 

  

or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

  

in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms’ quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

  

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fda’s qsr regulations which require manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design 

  

or manufacture a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing or labeling errors or design defects any voluntary or government mandated recall may divert management attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers any recall involving one of our products could also harm the reputation of the product and the company and would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 

  

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors’ efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the federal and state governments in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act which we refer to collectively as the health care reform law the health care reform law makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the united states among the provisions of the health care reform law of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

these measures could result in decreased net revenues from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts many of the details regarding the implementation of the health care reform law are yet to be determined and at this time it remains unclear the full effect that the health care reform law would have on our business 

  

also any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches in addition we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

  

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the united states department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

  

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the america’s recovery and reinvestment act in february 2009 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under the hitech act certain of hipaa’s privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities’ business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover the hitech act set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce hipaa and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal actions 

  

while we do not believe that we are a covered entity or a business associate under hipaa many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to hipaa some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business associate agreements which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information as defined by hipaa we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them triggering potential liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations alternatively some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information pursuant to the hitech act if the government determines that we are a business associate we could be additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for 

  

failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and new legal and regulatory requirements and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws indeed recent changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have already required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california vermont and nevada have adopted similar laws the advanced medical technology association advamed a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers has also recently released a revised code of ethics outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals this code became effective july 1 2009 these laws regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

  

in addition the recent health care reform law among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation the health care reform law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act or the civil monetary penalties statute 

  

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

  

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

  

outlook 

  

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however recent events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by employment housing and credit concerns continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2011and beyond 

  

we compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel aquaform ® technology we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves thereby enhancing the wearing experience through a combination of improved designs and materials coopervision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in existing and emerging markets as well as the growth of preferred modalities such as singleuse and monthly wearing options 

  

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly in the past three years coopervision launched monthly silicone hydrogel sphere toric and multifocal lens products under our biofinity ® brand and twoweek silicone hydrogel sphere and toric lens products under our avaira ® brand while we believe that we have high quality silicone hydrogel contact lens products our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market for example competitive silicone hydrogel singleuse and multifocal lens products are making substantial gains in market share and represent a risk to our business we have limited manufacturing capacity for our silicone hydrogel multifocal product and have not yet marketed a silicone hydrogel singleuse product our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability 

  

we are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance coopervision’s worldwide product lines new products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and pc technology™ materials and new lens designs including multifocal and singleuse silicone hydrogel lenses 

  

the medical device segment of the women’s healthcare market is highly fragmented coopersurgical competes based on brand awareness and market focused product offerings with a strategy that includes identifying and acquiring selected companies and product lines that improve its existing market

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends settlement obligations and acquisitions in connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities we intend to renegotiate our syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on january 31 2012 and may retire or purchase our senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material

cvi net sales 

  

the contact lens market has two major product categories 

  

   

   

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules otherwise defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly cvi offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in all primary modalities 

  

the market for conventional lenses that are replaced annually has shifted to disposable and frequently replaced lenses disposable lenses are designed for either daily twoweek or monthly replacement frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months significantly the market for commodity spherical lenses has shifted to valueadded spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels

cvi markets silicone hydrogel spherical toric and multifocal lens products under our biofinity and avaira brands that are manufactured using proprietary aquaform ® technology to increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear we believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and singleuse silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major competitors 

  

in fiscal 2010 cvi introduced the following products 

  

   

   

net sales growth includes increases in singleuse spheres up 12 and total spheres up 9 total toric lenses grew 13 including 24 growth of singleuse toric lenses and multifocal lenses grew 1 silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses grew 108 worldwide proclear products increased 9 driven by growth of singleuse lenses older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 14 and 12 respectively

cvi net sales by region 

  

   

cvi’s worldwide net sales grew 7 in the periodtoperiod comparison americas net sales grew 10 primarily due to market gains of cvi’s silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses up 104 in the period and singleuse lenses up 35 in our fiscal first quarter of 2010 we recorded 101 million of reductions to americas net sales due to outofperiod adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were underaccrued in fiscal 2009 emea net sales grew 2 in the period driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses up 115 and proclear 1 day lenses up 28 net sales to the asia pacific region grew 8 primarily due to sales growth of singleuse spherical and toric products up 9 and silicone hydrogel lenses up 98 

  

cvi’s net sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products primarily silicone hydrogel lenses while unit growth and product mix have influenced cvi’s sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth

cost of salesgross profit 

  

   

the increase in cvi’s gross margin is largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products cvi’s gross margin in fiscal 2009 included costs associated with fixed asset write offs such costs were not significant in fiscal 2010 the gross margin increase was partially offset by costs associated with the 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan recorded as cost of sales of 160 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 50 million for fiscal 2009 as discussed below these costs are primarily severance charges and accelerated depreciation and we expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan through the fiscal first quarter of 2011 gross margin for fiscal 2010 reflects the increase in accruals for rebates discussed above 

  

the increase in csi’s gross margin for fiscal 2010 is largely attributable to efficiency improvements changing product mix and to the recognition in the current year of a onetime 15 million settlement resolving a vendor dispute csi’s gross margin for the period also reflects higher margins on products used in surgical procedures that now represent 33 of net sales in the current period compared to 31 in fiscal 2009 

  

selling general and administrative expense sga 

  

   

consolidated sga increased 11 in fiscal 2010 and decreased by 9 in 2009 the decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to recessionary cost control measures partially offset by costs supporting increased sales levels and contact lenses used in marketing programs 

  

the increase in cvi’s sga in fiscal 2010 of 11 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to our increased investment in sales and marketing to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products as well as investments in infrastructure such as information technology cvi’s sga in fiscal 2009 included increased efficiencies as a result of the rationalization of distribution centers completed in fiscal 2008 decreased marketing expenses from the prior year that included several new product launches and the critical activity restructuring plan discussed below 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

the 15 increase in csi’s sga in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth along with legal expenses related to business acquisitions during the period csi’s decrease in sga in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to efficiencies from an acquisition including reduced marketing distribution and other general and administrative costs and decreased legal and sharebased compensation expenses 

  

corporate headquarters’ sga increased 2 in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased legal costs offset by reduced headcount lower sharebased compensation expense and audit costs the decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the 19 million reduction of accrued legal costs related to our acquisition of ocular sciences inc based on a settlement agreement reached in fiscal 2009 

  

research and development expense 

  

   

cvi research and development expense increased 3 in fiscal 2010 primarily due to investments in new technologies and clinical trials in fiscal 2009 cvi recorded a 30 million inprocess research and development charge related to the acquisition of certain distribution rights excluding the charge cvi’s research and development expenditures grew 16 during fiscal 2010 as compared to the prior year period cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing pc technology 

  

csi research and development expense increased 23 primarily due to investments in new products csi research and development activities include the upgrade and redesign of many csi incontinence assisted reproductive technology and uterine manipulation products and other gynecological and obstetrical product development activities 

  

restructuring costs 

  

2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan 

  

in the fiscal third quarter of 2009 coopervision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from norfolk virginia and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from adelaide australia to existing manufacturing operations in juana diaz puerto rico and hamble uk 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan this plan is intended to better utilize cvi’s manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees 

  

cvi completed restructuring activities in adelaide australia in our fiscal third quarter of 2010 and ceased operations in norfolk at the end of fiscal 2010 cvi expects to complete restructuring activities in norfolk in our fiscal first quarter of 2011 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

we estimate that the total restructuring costs under this plan will be approximately 243 million with about 173 million associated with assets including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs and about 7 million associated with employee benefit costs including anticipated severance payments termination benefit costs retention bonus payouts and other similar costs these costs will be reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of income 

  

in the year ended october 31 2010 161 million including 33 million of employee benefits costs and 128 million of costs associated with assets primarily noncash are reported as 160 million in cost of sales and 01 million in restructuring costs in the year ended october 31 2009 51 million including 36 million of employee benefit costs and 15 million of noncash costs associated with assets are reported as 50 million in cost of sales and 01 million in restructuring costs 

  

critical activity restructuring plan 

  

in fiscal 2009 coopervision substantially completed a global restructuring plan to focus the organization on our most critical activities refine our work processes and align costs with prevailing market conditions critical activity restructuring plan this restructuring plan involved the assessment of all locations’ activities exclusive of direct manufacturing and changes to streamline work processes as a result of the critical activity restructuring plan a number of positions were eliminated across certain business functions and geographic regions the total restructuring costs under this plan were 46 million primarily severance and benefit costs and were reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of income in the fiscal year ended october 31 2010 we reported 03 million in restructuring costs and in fiscal 2009 we reported 05 million in cost of sales and 38 million in restructuring costs 

  

the company may from time to time decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods 

  

amortization of intangibles 

  

amortization of intangibles was 181 million in 2010 179 million in 2009 and 168 million in 2008 amortization expense in fiscal 2009 includes a 15 million charge for a csi license that no longer had value

the increase in operating income in the fiscal 2010 period both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased gross margin dollars up 13 partially offset by increased operating expenses up 9 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 17 to 367 million in 2010 and decreased 17 to 441 million in 2009 following an increase of 16 to 530 million in 2008 the fiscal 2010 and 2009 decreases primarily reflect decreases in our longterm borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates the fiscal 2008 increase included the writeoff of 30 million of unamortized costs related to the repurchase of our 2625 convertible senior debentures and excluding such costs interest expense increased 9 in 2008 we had 5918 million in loans on our credit facility on october 31 2010 compared to 7640 million outstanding on october 31 2009 

  

settlements 

  

the company and several of its directors and officers were named in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit the nature and status of which is described in note 12 commitments and contingencies the company announced on may 4 2010 that it has reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for 270 million which we funded into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on august 16 2010 and final approval on december 13 2010 the company has exhausted its insurance coverage in defense of this litigation and if the settlement were to be overturned as a result of an appeal general and administrative expenses will increase 

  

the company is also a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative litigation against several current and former officers and directors of the company as described in note 12 commitments and contingencies an agreement in principle to settle has been reached which is subject to court approval this agreement would have the company pay attorney’s fees of counsel to the plaintiff’s in an amount not to exceed 750 thousand but no other amounts the company recorded a charge for the settlement amount in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010

the fiscal 2009 foreign exchange net gain is primarily due to the us dollar strengthening against other currencies and an initiative we completed in the quarter related to intercompany transactions 

  

in december 2008 we purchased through the open market in a privately negotiated transaction 110 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7125 senior notes at a discounted price of approximately 90 million plus accrued and unpaid interest we also wrote off approximately 02 million of unamortized costs related to the senior notes and recorded a gain on the repurchase in other income on our consolidated statement of income the company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under its 6500 million revolving line of credit 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

we recorded tax expense of 116 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to 143 million for fiscal year 2009 based on effective tax rates of 93 and 124 for 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income as well as litigation settlement charges incurred in the united states during the period 

  

sharebased compensation plans 

  

the company grants various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2010 was 102 million and 32 million respectively compared to 130 million and 42 million respectively in fiscal year 2009 as of october 31 2010 there was 151 million of total unrecognized sharebased compensation cost 54 million for stock options 69 million for restricted stock units and 28 million for performance shares the unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 28 years for nonvested stock options 23 years for restricted stock units and 18 years for performance shares cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 was 111 million 11 million and 63 million respectively 

  

the company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions the use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair value the expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes if our assumption for the expected life increased by one year the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2010 would have increased by approximately 1 to determine the stock price volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors if our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2010 would have increased by less than 1

the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed these adjustments totaled 12 million 29 million and 32 million in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

the company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common stock to certain executive officers if the company achieves specified longterm performance goals and vest after three years the company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current market price of our stock the total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture rates the company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter if achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable previously recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement if we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively

at the end of fiscal 2010 cooper’s inventory months on hand moh were 54 compared to 63 at fiscal yearend 2009 our days sales outstanding dso increased to 57 days at october 31 2010 from 55 days at october 31 2009 based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 

  

investing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 1066 million from investing activities in fiscal 2010 was for capital expenditures of 738 million primarily to improve manufacturing capacity and payments of 328 million related to acquisitions 

  

financing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 1616 million from financing activities in fiscal 2010 was driven by the 1825 million net repayments of longterm debt including the capital lease along with dividends on our common stock of 27 million the outflow was partially offset by proceeds from shortterm debt of 121 million and 115 million from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefit 

  

risk management 

  

most of our operations outside the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally our british pound sterling euro japanese yen and canadian dollardenominated debt and receivables and from operations in foreign currencies we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit varies with the london interbank offered rate our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a portion of variable rate debt effectively converting that portion to fixed rate debt for varying periods through may 2011 for additional detail see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

on january 31 2007 cooper entered into a 650 million syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit revolver and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 7125 senior notes due 2015 of which 339 million are outstanding see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements keybank led the revolver refinancing and the revolver matures on january 31 2012

new accounting pronouncements 

  

on november 1 2009 the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no apb 141 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion fsp apb 141 now included within fasb accounting standards codification 470 asc 470 debt with conversion and other options  asc 47020 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate as a result the liability component would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate and the liability component would be accreted to its par value over its expected life with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected in the results of operations

results of operations – continued 

  

this change in methodology affects the calculations of net income and earnings per share but does not increase the cash interest payments the convertible senior debentures that the company issued in fiscal 2003 and subsequently repurchased in fiscal 2008 are within the scope of asc 47020 and retrospective application to all periods presented is required therefore prior year amounts reflect the cumulative effect adjustment made to the opening retained earnings of fiscal year 2006 as presented in item 6 selected financial data 

  

the company has adjusted its reported results in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended october 31 2008 and its consolidated balance sheet as of october 31 2009 as follows

on november 1 2009 the company adopted asc subtopic 35030355a accounting for defensive intangible assets  asc 35030355a applies to defensive intangible assets which are acquired intangible assets that an entity does not intend to actively use but does intend to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset asc 35030355a requires an entity to account for defensive intangible assets as a separate unit of accounting defensive intangible assets should not be included as part of the cost of an entity’s existing intangible assets because the defensive intangible assets are separately identifiable defensive intangible assets must be recognized at fair value in accordance with asc 805 business combinations and asc 820 fair value measurement and disclosure  asc 35030355a is effective prospectively for intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 or our fiscal year 2010 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on november 1 2009 the company adopted the deferred portions of fasb asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  for its non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including longlived assets goodwill other intangible assets and exit liabilities this guidance defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value under 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this guidance applies whenever other accounting guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to new accounting transactions the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201006 which amends asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  asu 201006 amends asc 820 to add new requirements for disclosures about 1 the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 2 the valuation techniques and inputs used 3 the activity in level 3 fair value measurements and 4 the transfers between levels 1 2 and 3 fair value measurements asu 201006 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december 15 2009 except for the requirement to provide the level 3 activity of purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years in the period of initial adoption entities will not be required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes however those disclosures are required for periods ending after initial adoption the company does not anticipate the adoption of asu 201006 which is partially effective for the company for the fiscal year beginning on november 1 2010 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in february 2010 the fasb issued asu 201009 subsequent events topic 855 amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements this amendment removes the requirement for an sec filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of us gaap the amendment in the asu was effective for the company upon issuance february 24 2010 as this guidance relates to removing a disclosure its adoption had no effect on the consolidated financial statements 

  

on august 1 2010 the company adopted asu no 201011 which is included in the codification under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  the amended guidance clarifies the scope exception for embedded credit derivative features related to the transfer of credit risk in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another the amendments address how to determine which embedded credit derivative features including those in collateralized debt obligations and synthetic collateralized debt obligations are considered to be embedded derivatives that should not be analyzed for potential bifurcation and separate accounting as well as under which circumstances embedded credit derivative features would not qualify for the scope exception and would be subject to potential bifurcation and separate accounting the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

on october 31 2010 the company adopted a new accounting standard under asc 71520 compensation – retirement benefits  that requires additional disclosures about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk for an employer’s plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan as well as disclosure of fair value levels similar to the disclosure

requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard see note 11 as this guidance only requires enhanced disclosures which the company has provided its adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

  

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment our reporting units are the same as our business segments – cvi and csi – reflecting the way that we manage our business 

  

the fair value of our reporting units is determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business for the current year management determined the fair value of our reporting units using the income valuation approach 

  

in the application of the income approach the company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital we used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy the discount rates used in the current year are about 200 basis points higher than those used in our analysis for fiscal year 2009 reflecting the current condition of the united states and the global economy the company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near term net sales expectations and longterm projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports as a sensitivity analysis a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2010 and extending through the valuation period would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill 

  

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an

impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders’ equity and financial condition 

  

   

   

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

  

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any

unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of asc 740 accounting for income taxes  the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of income and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense 

  

   

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes in determining the expected volatility management considers implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the us treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

  

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

  

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the company’s policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes for additional information please see risk management discussed above in capital resources and liquidity and derivative instruments in note 1 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

longterm debt 

  

total debt decreased to 6111 million at october 31 2010 from 7815 million at october 31 2009 longterm debt includes 339 million of senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in december 2008 we purchased through the open market in a privately negotiated transaction 110 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7125 senior notes at a discounted price of approximately 90 million plus accrued and unpaid interest we wrote off about 02 million of unamortized costs related to the senior notes and recorded a gain on the repurchase in other income on our consolidated statements of income the company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under our 650 million revolving line of credit on july 1 2008 the company repurchased all 115 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2625 convertible senior debentures issued in 2003 and due 2023 securities pursuant to the terms of the debentures for the securities and therefore no securities remain outstanding see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements the company paid the aggregate repurchase price from borrowings under our 650 million revolving line of credit on july 1 2008 we also wrote off 30 million of unamortized costs related to the securities 

  

in connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities we intend to renegotiate the revolver and we may retire or purchase our senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

  

   

as of october 31 2010 the scheduled maturities of the company’s fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 

  

   

as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2010 it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2010 the company has interest rate swaps outstanding that are designed to fix the borrowing costs related to 1250 million of the outstanding balance on the company’s syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about 22 million

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 develops manufactures and markets healthcare products primarily medical devices through its two business units coopervision inc cvi and coopersurgical inc csi 

  

cvi develops manufactures and markets a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market cvi is a leading manufacturer of toric lenses which correct astigmatism multifocal lenses for presbyopia blurring near vision due to advancing age and spherical lenses that correct the most common visual defects cvi’s products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico norfolk virginia and scottsville new york cvi distributes products out of rochester new york the united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

  

csi develops manufactures and markets medical devices diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians csi’s products are primarily manufactured and distributed at its facilities in trumbull connecticut stafford texas and pasadena california 

  

cvi and csi each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

we compete in the worldwide soft contact lens market and service the three primary regions of the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific including japan the contact lens market has two major product segments 

  

   

   

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules otherwise defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 

  

cvi offers spherical aspherical toric multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in all primary modalities we estimate the worldwide market for contact lenses by modality is 34 percent singleuse 39 percent twoweek and 27 percent monthly to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips™ a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility provides cvi with competitive advantage by 

  

   

   

in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology cooper’s proclear ® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates a proprietary phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

the contact lens market has in recent years experienced a shift toward contact lenses made from silicone hydrogel materials silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material or “dkt” than traditional hydrogel lenses the use of these materials in contact lenses has grown significantly and this material is a major product material in the industry cvi has launched biofinity ® and avaira ®  silicone hydrogel spherical contact lens products in the united states europe and asia pacific excluding japan we also launched a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens under the biofinity label in the first calendar quarter of 2009 

  

in addition to its silicone hydrogel and pc technology™ product offerings cvi competes in the contact lens market with its singleuse products and with traditional hydrogel products utilizing advanced design technologies 

  

contact lens product sales 

  

spheres cvi’s spherical lens net sales grew 3 percent in fiscal 2009 with disposable sphere growth of 4 percent and singleuse spheres representing 21 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales up 15 percent cvi’s silicone hydrogel spherical lens net sales for fiscal 2009 were 997 million or 11 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales 

  

toric and multifocal cvi’s toric lens net sales representing 31 percent of cvi’s soft lens net sales in fiscal 2009 declined 7 percent due primarily to a trend in the market toward silicone hydrogel toric lenses cvi’s newly introduced silicone hydrogel toric lens had sales of 124 million singleuse toric lenses grew 71 percent multifocal lens sales grew 7 percent 

  

proclear cvi’s pc technology products – which consist of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics ® xc and proclear 1 day – continued market share gains as sales increased 7 percent in fiscal 2009 proclear toric sales grew 5 percent proclear spheres grew 5 percent and proclear multifocal lenses grew 14 percent 

  

cvi fiscal 2009 net sales growth by geographic region 

  

we have experienced sales growth in many geographic regions that we believe will continue and that there will be lower contact lens wearer drop out rates as technology improves in addition we believe that there is a continuing shift in practitioner preferences from lowfeatured “commodity” lenses to highervalue specialty and singleuse lenses that supports a favorable world market outlook this includes a trend to fitting silicone hydrogel lenses 

  

cvi’s worldwide net sales grew 3 percent in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 with the americas region representing 43 percent of cvi’s fiscal 2009 worldwide net sales up 1 percent emea representing 38 percent of worldwide net sales up 2 percent and the asia pacific region representing 19 percent of worldwide net sales up 12 percent 

  

americas 

  

we estimate the americas region by modality is 12 percent singleuse 63 percent twoweek and 25 percent monthly cvi americas net sales growth was driven by sales of our silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses biofinity and avaira totaling 659 million a 7 percent increase in sales of pc technology lenses and all singleuse spherical and toric lens sales increasing 41 percent 

  

emea 

  

we estimate the emea region by modality is 38 percent singleuse 12 percent twoweek and 50 percent monthly emea net sales growth was driven by sales of silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses totaling 415 million a 4 percent increase in pc technology lens sales and all singleuse spherical and toric lens sales increasing 5 percent cvi estimates that it is the second largest contact lens supplier in europe with direct business units in france germany holland hungary italy the netherlands norway portugal spain sweden and the united kingdom 

  

asia pacific 

  

we estimate the asia pacific region by modality is 54 percent singleuse 31 percent twoweek and 15 percent monthly asia pacific net sales growth was driven by sales of singleuse spherical and toric lenses up 20 percent and a 96 percent increase in biofinity spherical lenses 

  

cvi competition 

  

the contact lens market is highly competitive cvi’s three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical toric and multifocal lens segments of that market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

recent trends in marketing spherical lenses include a shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses primarily in the united states europe and japan and toward singleuse lenses cvi’s primary competitors currently control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market cvi is taking market share with its monthly and twoweek spherical lens offerings but its share is still lagging due to the late entry of these products into the market in japan cvi does not have regulatory approval to sell a silicone hydrogel product and only has the rights to market or sell its current twoweek silicone hydrogel products 

  

in the toric lens market lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners cvi believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors providing greater choices for patient and practitioner and better visual acuity and that it offers superior customer services including high standards of ontime product delivery however there is a developing trend in the united states toric lens market toward silicone hydrogel products cvi 

  

launched a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens under the biofinity label in the first calendar quarter of 2009 and plans to launch a twoweek silicone hydrogel toric under the avaira label in fiscal year 2010 that will allow us to compete in this market shift to silicone hydrogel torics 

  

cvi’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces nevertheless cvi offers a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the company’s lens products cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well equipped through extensive training to meet the needs of contact lens practitioners and their customers 

  

cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects cvi believes that it will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share cvi also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales of contact lenses because each modality serves a different age group cvi believes that almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties while refractive surgery patients are typically in their late thirties or early forties when their vision has stabilized 

  

coopersurgical 

  

since its beginning in 1990 csi has successfully established a leading position among companies providing medical device products to the obstetrics and gynecology medical specialty historically many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system csi’s strategy has been and continues to be to identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that will improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas csi has grown to 1709 million in net sales both organically and through a series of more than 25 acquisitions during the past five years csi’s net sales grew at a compounded rate of 11 percent with doubledigit operating margins and minimal capital expenditure requirements

based on united states census estimates csi expects patient visits to united states obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is a large group of women of childbearing age and a rapidly growing middleaged population with emerging gynecologic concerns consistent with an aging population menopausal problems – abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis – are expected to increase while pregnancy contraceptive management and general examinations are expected to remain relatively stable the trend toward delaying the age of childbearing to the midthirties and beyond will likely drive increasing treatment for infertility 

  

while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

csi’s 2009 net sales growth 

  

during 2009 csi’s net sales grew 2 percent to 1709 million from 1683 million in 2008 representing 16 percent of cooper’s net sales in both periods fiscal 2009 sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 14 and represent 33 of csi’s total net sales 

  

csi competition 

  

csi focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances csi offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure the market segments in which csi competes remains fragmented typified by smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

  

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi believes that it competes successfully with its superior sales and marketing and the technological advantages of its products as well as by developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as csi expands its product line it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

  

csi is expanding its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is dominated by larger competitors such as johnson  johnson’s ethicon endosurgery and ethicon women’s health and urology companies boston scientific and gyrus acmi these competitors have well established positions within the operating room environment csi believes its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic surgery will facilitate its expansion within the surgical segment of the market 

  

research and development 

  

cooper employs 149 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments primarily in cvi external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support product development and clinical research for cvi products cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop silicone hydrogel products product lines utilizing pc technology and expansion of singleuse product lines csi conducts research and development inhouse and also employs external surgical specialists including members of its surgical advisory board csi’s fiscal 2009 research and development activities were for the upgrade and redesign of existing incontinence assisted reproductive technology and uterine manipulation products 

  

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during the fiscal years ended october 31 2009 2008 and 2007 were 303 million 355 million and 327 million net of acquired inprocess research and development of 30 million in 2009 and 72 million in 2007 net research and development expenditures represented 3 of net sales in each fiscal year during fiscal 2009 cvi represented 87 and csi represented 13 of the total expenditures we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs 

  

government regulation 

  

medical device regulation 

  

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur for example to qualify our new silicone hydrogel contact lens products for extended wear use we believe that more extensive premarket testing and approval would be required 

  

device classification 

  

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes – class i ii or iii – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require substantially lower levels of regulation the majority of csi’s products are class ii devices 

  

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda’s general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda’s quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

  

class ii devices are subject to the fda’s general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma as of october 2002 unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

  

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class 

  

iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

  

510k clearance pathway 

  

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

  

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained also in these circumstances a manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

  

premarket approval pathway 

  

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device 

  

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

  

clinical trials 

  

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

  

continuing fda regulation 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

  

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

foreign regulation 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 9000 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

other health care regulation 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

antikickback and fraud law 

  

our operations may be subject to antikickback laws the federal antikickback statutes which are commonly known collectively as the medicare fraud and abuse statute prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid the definition of “remuneration” under this statute has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value including such items as gifts discounts waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value while we believe most sales of our products are not subject to the federal antikickback statutes many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal antikickback statutes some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source not only by the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

in addition to establishing federal privacy security and transaction standards the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created two new fraud and abuse laws the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payors the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services this statute applies to any health benefit plan not just medicare and medicaid additionally hipaa granted expanded enforcement authority to health and human services hhs and the us department of justice doj and provided enhanced resources to support the activities and responsibilities of the office of inspector general oig and doj by authorizing large increases in funding for investigating fraud and abuse violations relating to healthcare delivery and payment 

  

physician selfreferral laws 

  

we may also be subject to federal and state physician selfreferral laws the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly known as the stark law prohibits subject to certain exceptions physician referrals of medicare and medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts various states have corollary laws to the stark law including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state 

  

false claims laws 

  

under separate statutes submission of claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid andor federallyfunded state health programs these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 5500 and 11000 for each separate false claim suits filed under the false claims act known as “qui tam” actions can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals known as “relators” or more commonly as “whistleblowers” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement in addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action pay fines or be excluded from the medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action 

  

raw materials 

  

cvi’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products comfilcon a if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi 

  

raw materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

marketing and distribution 

  

in the united states cvi markets its products through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors cvi augments its united states sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in professional journals in 

  

australia canada china france germany holland hungary italy japan korea malaysia norway portugal singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom cvi primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries cvi uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products 

  

csi’s products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows and using ecommerce telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

  

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

  

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of cooper’s products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper aggressively protects its intellectual property rights 

  

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than 

  

   

   

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

  

dependence on customers 

  

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 

  

government contracts 

  

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

  

backlog 

  

backlog is not a material factor in either of cooper’s business units 

  

seasonality 

  

cvi’s contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

  

compliance with environmental laws 

  

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect cooper’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

  

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens segment cvi faces intense competition from competitors’ products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than cvi 

  

our major competitors in the specialty contact lens business offer competitive products and newer materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses moreover silicone hydrogel lenses are gaining market acceptance in the specialty lens business particularly in the us and while we have recently introduced our own competitive silicone hydrogel specialty product our late introduction of this product versus competitive products may not be sufficient to prevent erosion of our specialty lens market share and margins 

  

the market for our nonspecialty commodity contact lenses is also intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to successfully introduce new products on a timely basis in the united states europe and japan and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to a lesser extent cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

  

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that our competitors’ newer specialty lens products will not successfully erode cvi’s highermargin specialty lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in the women’s healthcare segment competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche areas some of which have 

  

substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

  

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

  

in the united states and globally current market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth the us economy has been in a recession for the past two years and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and an unstable real estate market countries globally are affected by similar systemic impacts we continue to experience slower than historical growth in contact lens sales particularly in the us and continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in 2010 

  

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads continued turbulence in the united states and international market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

if current market conditions do not improve the demand for contact lenses may materially decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence 

  

product innovations are important in the contact lens business in which cvi competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which csi competes historically we did not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others however since 2005 we have been investing more in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

  

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits in addition we have been slower to introduce silicone hydrogel specialty contact lens products than our competitors market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

  

technological developments in the eye care and women’s healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances were to provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our current operations for cvi are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately 63 and 62 of our net sales for cvi for the years ended october 31 2009 and 2008 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states further we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

  

acquisitions that we may make may involve numerous risks 

  

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at csi we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events enforcement action by the fda or other regulatory body if we are found to be in noncompliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmpss or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 

  

cvi manufactures molded contact lenses which represent a significant portion of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom and puerto rico csi manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut stafford texas and pasadena california we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

  

cvi distributes products out of rochester new york and the united kingdom and various smaller international distribution facilities csi’s products are primarily distributed out of its facility in trumbull connecticut any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted and our product sales and profitability could suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fda’s cgmp and qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state 

  

authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a cgmp qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

  

we are in the process of shutting down manufacturing facilities and have excess manufacturing capacity which may reduce our reported earnings 

  

we are in the process of shutting down manufacturing facilities completely in norfolk virginia and partially in adelaide australia and transferring production to our facilities in puerto rico and the united kingdom changing production facilities on product lines creates operational risk and products having regulatory approvals tied to the closed facilities will require regulatory approval from the new facility any failure to successfully transfer our production could adversely affect our product sales and profitability in addition depending on our market growth we may have more production capacity than necessary to meet future demand if we are unable to put purchased capacity into production we may have to writeoff new or existing lines which would adversely impact our reported earnings 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used by us are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products biofinity and avaira if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi a disruption in the supply of comfilcon a could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

  

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property our business could suffer 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

  

   

   

   

   

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further we cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

  

we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information furthermore enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable certain patents protecting our proclear line of products are due to expire in fiscal year 2011 which could allow competitors to market and sell products with similar attributes if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies we could lose competitive advantage and be materially adversely affected 

  

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks also we might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

  

the laws of other foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our intellectual property could be subject to claims of infringement 

  

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied 

  

for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products claims that our products infringe the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales incorporating our technology 

  

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry third parties have made and it is possible that they will make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

  

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

  

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand in addition consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products in the future 

  

we face risks in connection with securities litigation 

  

the company and several of its directors and officers have been named in a consolidated putative securities class action lawsuit and its directors and certain of its officers have been named in two consolidated derivative lawsuits the nature and status of which are described in item 3 legal proceedings the consolidated putative securities class action seeks unspecified damages from the company and we are unable to estimate the range of potential losses that would be incurred if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail or to determine the total effect that it may have on our results of 

  

operations financial position and cash flows however legal expenses beyond those presently contemplated to be incurred through trial currently scheduled for march 2010 or a settlement or adverse judgment on the merits of the action could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity results of operations and financial condition in addition securities litigation irrespective of its merits is costly to defend and diverts management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

  

the purported derivative lawsuits which are at a very preliminary stage do not seek damages from the company however derivative litigation is costly and these lawsuits may divert management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

  

we face risks related to environmental matters 

  

our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

  

we are conducting a voluntary cleanup at one of our sites in the state of new york although the workplan that we submitted to the state has been approved and we believe that the cleanup is proceeding in accordance with the workplan and our expectations there can be no assurance that the cleanup will be completed within the timeframe and cost projected that the expected results will be achieved or that we will not identify alternate sources or higher levels of contamination as such there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection therewith 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

  

our substantial indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit facility and senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests in addition current conditions in the global debt markets would make it difficult and costly to refinance our credit facility and senior notes our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to effectively manage our risks which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results 

  

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the pound sterling euro japanese yen swedish krona and canadian dollar we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely these hedges also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations finally because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a periodoverperiod comparative basis 

  

we may be required to recognize impairment charges on goodwill which would reduce our net income consolidated net worth and stockholders’ equity 

  

pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a charge for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings in a period of such change in addition such charges would reduce our consolidated net income if such charges were included in our covenant calculations it could result in noncompliance with certain financial covenants under our credit facilities in the period of such charge 

  

we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2009 and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill the fair value of our reporting units was determined using a combination of the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method and the market valuation approach under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 

  

actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from our estimates goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or the annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders’ equity and financial condition 

  

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws in addition the internal revenue service irs has been auditing the company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 – 2007 and we are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by other tax authorities the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results 

  

we operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results we have overseas manufacturing administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions recently a number of countries including the united states have proposed changes to their tax laws some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions such changes in tax laws or their interpretation if adopted could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results in addition the us congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals to reform the us health care system certain of these proposals contemplate that a portion of the cost of such proposals would be paid by imposing new fees or taxes on medical device companies we cannot at this time anticipate which if any of these proposals will become law the magnitude of taxes that would be imposed on the company under any enacted law or whether any such taxes will materially affect our profitability 

  

we are in the process of upgrading certain of our management information systems and we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruption of our business 

  

we have implemented a management information system at our major locations and are in the process of implementing related systems for substantially all of our businesses worldwide many other companies have had severe problems with computer system implementations of this nature and scope 

  

we are using a controlled project plan and we believe we have assigned adequate staffing and other resources to the projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that the design will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as designed we are heavily dependent on such computer systems and any failure or delay in the system implementation would cause a substantial interruption to our business additional expense and loss of sales customers and profits 

  

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing engineering and scientific personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

  

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

  

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we will also be afforded the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquiror to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

  

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

  

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

  

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s design development testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

  

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

  

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

development and marketing of our products are subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda 

  

in the european economic area a medical device can only be placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the european directives and implementing regulations that govern medical devices these directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required iso certification and to approve the use of ce marking in order to maintain iso certification and ce marking quality benchmarks firms’ quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits 

  

in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have 

  

not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations however our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fda’s cgmp and qsr regulations which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing or labeling errors or design defects any voluntary or government mandated recall may divert management attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers any recall involving one of our products could also harm the reputation of the product and the company and would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 

  

changes in legislation and government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors’ efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the federal and state governments the current administration has made health care reform a priority and there have been a significant number of federal legislative initiatives and reform measures this past year pending and future legislative proposals could effect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level among the proposals under consideration are annual nondeductible fees on manufacturers or importers of certain prescription drugs biologics or medical devices offered for sale in the united states price controls on hospitals insurance market reforms to expand the availability of health insurance requirements that companies that sell products to hospitals and other healthcare providers must publicly disclose their prices and the creation of a government health insurance plan or plan designed to ensure coverage for all citizens federal legislation also has been introduced to avoid a 212 percent reduction in 2010 payments to physicians for services provided to medicare patients by revising the applicable statutory formula used to develop the medicare payment rates in past years annual federal legislation avoided reductions stemming from the formula and current pending legislation would revise the formula to prevent the need for annual legislative adjustments in this area 

  

this year new health care reform measures that were passed include appropriation of federal funds to conduct support or synthesize research that compares and evaluates the risk and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products among other things the comparative effectiveness research is intended to improve the quality of health care but how the research will impact coverage reimbursement or other policies developed by health insurance companies remains unclear there also continues to be efforts at the federal level to introduce expanded fraud and abuse and antireferral legislation and to further reduce certain medicare and medicaid expenditures by 

  

revising coverage and reimbursement policies a broad range of both similar and more comprehensive healthcare reform initiatives is likely to be considered at the state level although it is uncertain which if any of these or other proposals will be adopted the potential for adoption of these proposals affects or may affect our ability to market our products 

  

any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches in addition we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

  

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the department of health and human services hhs has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the electronic transactions rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information the security rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information and requires the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards 

  

additionally the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the stimulus package in february 2009 previously hipaa directly regulated only certain covered entities such as health care providers and health plans under hitech certain of hipaa’s privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities’ business associates as a result business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements moreover hitech creates a new requirement to report any breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so 

  

while we do not believe that we are a covered entity under hipaa many of our customers are covered entities subject to hipaa such customers may require us to enter into business associate 

  

agreements which obligate us to safeguard certain health information we obtain in the course of servicing their customers restrict the manner in which we use and disclose such information and impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations pursuant to the hitech act as business associates we are now additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements the costs of complying with these contractual obligations new legal and regulatory requirements and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws indeed recent changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have already required us to alter certain of our compliance efforts for example in april of 2009 massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare practitioners this regulation became effective on july 1 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state additionally the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs other states eg california and nevada have adopted similar laws the advanced medical technology association advamed a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers has also recently released a revised code of ethics outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals this code became effective july 1 2009 these laws regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices require the dedication of resources to ensure compliance and expose us to additional liabilities 

  

any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in these laws regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

results of operations 

  

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

  

outlook 

  

overall we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets however recent events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of the united states and international credit markets and ongoing recessionary pressures in the united states and globally continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2010 and beyond 

  

we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine pc technology™ and silicone hydrogel aquaform ® technology we believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and the shift in practitioner preferences from lowfeatured “commodity” lenses to highervalue specialty and singleuse lenses continue to support a favorable world market outlook cvi expects greater market penetration in europe and asia as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in those regions 

  

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly the company launched biofinity ® sphere in 2007 and avaira ® sphere in 2008 both silicone hydrogel contact lens products while customer reaction for these products has been favorable our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market in addition to spheres competitive silicone hydrogel toric products are making substantial gains in market share and represent a risk to our toric business we launched a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens under the biofinity label in the first calendar quarter of 2009 and plan to launch a twoweek silicone hydrogel toric under the avaira label in fiscal year 2010 we believe that these products will allow us to compete in this market shift to silicone hydrogel torics our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability 

  

we launched proclear ® 1 day in japan in the first calendar quarter of 2009 we are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance cvi’s broad and competitive worldwide product lines new products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and pc technology™ materials and new lens designs including toric and multifocal lenses

csi is a leader in the fragmented medical device segment of women’s healthcare with strong brand awareness and market focused product offerings that appeal to an extensive customer base csi has been successful in identifying and acquiring selected smaller companies and product lines that improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas we intend to continue to invest in csi’s business through acquisitions of companies and product lines 

  

regarding capital resources we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of 39 million plus cash from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends and acquisitions

cost of salesgross profit 

  

   

cvi’s margin was 54 in fiscal 2009 compared with 58 in fiscal 2008 the decline is largely attributed to costs associated with inventory and equipment writeoffs and idle equipment also in our fiscal third quarter of 2009 we initiated the 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan to move contact lens manufacturing primarily from norfolk virginia to existing manufacturing operations in juana diaz puerto rico and hamble uk in fiscal 2009 50 million of costs associated with this manufacturing restructuring plan primarily severance charges and accelerated depreciation were recorded as costs of sales as discussed below we expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan through the fiscal first quarter of 2011 

  

csi’s margin was 60 in fiscal 2009 and 59 in fiscal 2008 gross margin reflects csi’s emphasis on organic growth and the increase is a result of manufacturing efficiencies along with a changing product mix including higher margin products marketed directly to hospitals that represent 33 of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 30 in fiscal 2008

cvi’s sga decreased 10 in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased efficiencies as a result of the rationalization of distribution centers completed in fiscal 2008 and decreased marketing expenses from the prior year that included several new product launches sga costs also decreased as a result of the critical activity restructuring plan discussed below initiated in the fiscal first quarter of 2009 sga as a percentage of net sales decreased to 34 in 2009 from 39 in 2008 and 41 in 2007

csi’s sga decreased 7 at 31 of net sales in fiscal 2009 from 34 of net sales in fiscal 2008 marketing distribution and other general and administration costs decreased primarily due to improved efficiencies from a recent acquisition and decreased legal and sharebased compensation expenses fiscal 2008 sga increased 6 over 2007 on increased selling and distribution costs to support the emphasis on organic sales growth 

  

corporate headquarters’ sga which decreased 4 to 280 million in 2009 and decreased 8 to 291 million in 2008 were 3 of consolidated net sales in both periods the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to the 19 million reduction of accrued legal costs related to our acquisition of ocular sciences inc based on a settlement agreement reached in our fiscal second quarter of 2009 the decrease in 2008 was primarily due to expense recovery related to forfeitures of sharebased awards

restructuring costs 

  

2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan 

  

in the fiscal third quarter of 2009 coopervision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from norfolk virginia and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from adelaide australia to existing manufacturing operations in juana diaz puerto rico and hamble uk 2009 coopervision manufacturing restructuring plan this plan is intended to better utilize cvi’s manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees the norfolk plant manufactures about 7 of coopervision’s annual lens production however no additional hires are anticipated in puerto rico or the uk as part of this plan due to recent gains in manufacturing efficiencies 

  

the company expects to complete restructuring activities in adelaide australia in our fiscal first quarter of 2010 and in norfolk virginia in our fiscal first quarter of 2011 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

we estimate that the total restructuring costs under this plan will be approximately 24 million with about 17 million associated with assets including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs and about 7 million associated with employee benefit costs including anticipated severance payments termination benefit costs retention bonus payouts and other similar costs these costs are reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of operations in the year ended october 31 2009 total costs 51 million including 36 million of employee benefit costs and 15 million of noncash costs associated with assets are reported as 50 million in cost of sales and 01 million in restructuring costs at october 31 2009 the total accrued restructuring liability recorded in other accrued liabilities was 30 million 

  

critical activity restructuring plan 

  

in the fiscal first quarter of 2009 coopervision began a global restructuring plan to focus the organization on our most critical activities refine our work processes and align costs with prevailing market conditions critical activity restructuring plan this restructuring plan involved the assessment of all locations’ activities exclusive of direct manufacturing and changes to streamline work processes as a result of the critical activity restructuring plan a number of positions were eliminated across certain business functions and geographic regions the company substantially completed the critical activity restructuring plan in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2009 

  

the total restructuring costs under this plan were 43 million primarily severance and benefit costs and are reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of operations in the year ended october 31 2009 we reported 05 million in cost of sales and 38 million in restructuring costs at october 31 2009 the total accrued restructuring liability recorded in other accrued liabilities was 06 million 

  

the company may from time to time decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods 

  

amortization of intangibles 

  

amortization of intangibles was 179 million in 2009 168 million in 2008 and 162 million in 2007 amortization expense in fiscal 2009 includes a 15 million charge for a csi license that no longer has value

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 13 to 441 million in 2009 following an increase of 19 to 508 million in 2008 from 427 million in 2007 the fiscal 2009 decrease primarily reflects a decrease in our longterm borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates the fiscal 2008 increase included the writeoff of 30 million of unamortized costs related to the repurchase of our 2625 convertible senior debentures and excluding such costs interest expense increased 12 in 2008 we had 7640 million in loans on our credit facility on october 31 2009 compared to 8614 million outstanding on october 31 2008 

  

other income expense net 

  

   

provision for income taxes 

  

we recorded tax expense of 143 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 107 million for fiscal year 2008 based on effective tax rates of 124 and 140 for 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income 

  

sharebased compensation plans 

  

the company grants various sharebased compensation awards including stock options performance shares restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2009 was 130 million and 42 million respectively compared to 149 million and 40 million respectively in fiscal year 2008 as of october 31 2009 there was 128 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 14 years for nonvested stock options and restricted stock units cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was 11 million and 63 million respectively 

  

the company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed these adjustments totaled 29 million in fiscal year 2009 and 32 million in fiscal year 2008

capital resources and liquidity 

  

2009 highlights 

  

   

   

   

comparative statistics 

  

   

working capital 

  

the increase in working capital in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to decreases in shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities an increase in our trade accounts receivable also contributed to the increase the increase in working capital was partially offset by the decrease in inventory 

  

operating cash flows 

  

cash flow provided from operating activities continued as cooper’s major source of liquidity totaling 2231 million in fiscal 2009 and 965 million in 2008 operating cash flow increased primarily due to higher net income 

  

at the end of fiscal 2009 cooper’s inventory months on hand moh were 63 compared to 81 at fiscal yearend 2008 our days sales outstanding dso decreased to 55 days at october 31 2009 from 59 days at october 31 2008 based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 

  

investing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 986 million from investing activities in fiscal 2009 was for capital expenditures of 939 million primarily to improve manufacturing capacity and payments of 47 million related to acquisitions

financing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 1227 million from financing activities in fiscal 2009 was driven by net repayments of longterm debt of 853 million and shortterm debt of 360 million along with dividends on our common stock of 27 million the outflow was partially offset by proceeds of 11 million from the exercise of stock options 

  

risk management 

  

most of our operations outside the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally our british pound sterling euro japanese yen swedish krona and canadian dollardenominated debt and receivables and from operations in foreign currencies we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit varies with the london interbank offered rate our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through may 2011 for additional detail see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

on january 31 2007 cooper entered into a 650 million syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit revolver and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 7125 senior notes due 2015 of which 339 million are outstanding see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements keybank led the revolver refinancing and the revolver matures on january 31 2012 

  

in connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

  

outlook – global market and economic conditions 

  

in the united states and globally recent market and economic conditions continue to be challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth during 2009 for our fiscal year ended october 31 2009 continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit bank failures and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the united states and the global economy these conditions combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have contributed to substantial declines in capital markets and consumer confidence 

  

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit continues to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional

investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers ongoing turbulence in the united states and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions do not improve they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs resulting in potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations these conditions appear to have affected the markets for our products as consumer spending decreased resulting in slower growth in 2009 

  

we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of 39 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends and acquisitions over the past two fiscal years the company has made a significant investment in manufacturing capacity to support our silicone hydrogel and daily disposable contact lens product lines and improved capacity utilization as a result we plan to reduce overall capital expenditures related to manufacturing management believes that our projected outlook on sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months at october 31 2009 we had 2906 million of available credit and we are in compliance with financial covenants related to our credit facilities

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting standards for business combinations under accounting standards codification asc 805 which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired the new standards also establish disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination in april 2009 the fasb issued additional standards under asc 80520 to clarify initial recognition and measurement subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination we adopted the requirements of this standard on november 1 2009 the first day of our fiscal year ending october 31 2010 the impact of the adoption of these new standards will depend on the nature and extent of business combinations occurring on or after november 1 2009 

  

in december 2008 the fasb issued new standards under asc 71520 which provides guidance on an employer’s disclosure about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk for these plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan further it requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets the new standards under asc 71520 will be adopted by the company in its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending october 31 2010 on a prospective basis the company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued an amendment to the derecognition guidance in asc 860 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying specialpurpose entities the company does not anticipate the adoption which is effective for the company for the fiscal year beginning on november 1 2010 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued the consolidation guidance for variableinterest entities to replace the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise if any has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance the company does not anticipate the adoption which is effective for the company for the fiscal year beginning on november 1 2010 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb established that the “fasb accounting standards codification” codification would become the single official source of authoritative us gaap other than guidance issued by the sec superseding existing fasb american institute of certified public accountants emerging issues task force and related accounting literature after that date only one level of authoritative us gaap exists all other literature is now considered nonauthoritative 

  

the codification did not change us gaap the codification became effective for interim and annual periods ended on or after september 15 2009 we adopted this standard as of september 15 2009 with the only impact being the update to and removal of certain references in our consolidated financial statements to technical accounting literature

in august 2009 the fasb issued an update to asc 820 regarding fair value measurement this accounting standards update asu no 20095asu 20095 amends the provisions in asc 820 related to the fair value measurement of liabilities and clarifies for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available asu 20095 is intended to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities we adopted the requirements of this standard on november 1 2009 the first day of our fiscal year ending october 31 2010 asu 20095 concerns disclosure only and will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2009 the fasb issued an update to asc 605 regarding revenue recognition this asu no 200913 asu 200913 provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables in a revenue arrangement exist how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated asu 200913 eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management’s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item asu 200913 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 or our fiscal year 2011 early adoption is permitted if the company elects to adopt asu no 200914 concurrently the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of asu 200913 on its consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2009 the fasb issued an update to asc 985605 this asu 200914 amends the scope of the software revenue guidance in asc 985605 to exclude tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality asu 200914 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 or our fiscal year 2011 early adoption is permitted if the company elects to adopt asu 200913 concurrently the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of asu 200914 on its consolidated financial statements 

  

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

our reporting units are the same as our business segments – cvi and csi – reflecting the way that we manage our business we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 

  

we performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2009 and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill the fair value of our reporting units is 

  

the cooper companies inc and subsidiaries 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof under the income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life under the market approach the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 

  

in the application of the income and market valuation approaches the company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital we used discount rates which are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units in comparison with guideline companies with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy the discount rates used in the current year are about 200 basis points lower than our prior interim analysis completed as of october 31 2008 due to changes in credit markets and the current condition of the us and the global economy management determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near term revenue expectations and long term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports the net sales forecasts used in the annual goodwill impairment test for 2009 were consistent with our prior interim analysis completed as of october 31 2008 for the current year management determined that applying equal weight to both our income and market analyses provided the most reliable indications of fair value of our reporting units 

  

in reconciling the combined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization we used the closing price of our common stock at april 30 2009 the end of our fiscal second quarter and we applied a premium for control based on our review of premiums paid by third parties in comparable recent transactions we determined an appropriate premium for control by analyzing individual transactions in our markets and selected target companies whose operations were comparable to our two reporting units management will continue to monitor the relationship of cooper’s market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value and to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill 

  

actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price trades below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or the annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders’ equity and financial condition

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

   

   

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

  

regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position we measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of asc 740 accounting for income taxes  the interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our consolidated statement of operations and presented in the consolidated balance sheet we classify interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense

results of operations – continued 

  

under these fair value recognition provisions sharebased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating cooper’s stock price volatility employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 

  

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the us treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

  

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

  

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of asc 718 the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period in 2005 prior to the adoption of the accounting standard revision the company valued its sharebased compensation using the intrinsic value method 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the company’s policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes for additional information please see risk management discussed above in capital resources and liquidity and derivative instruments in note 1 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

longterm debt 

  

total debt decreased to 7815 million at october 31 2009 from 9048 million at october 31 2008 longterm debt includes 339 million of senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in december 2008 we purchased through the open market in a privately negotiated transaction 110 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7125 senior notes at a discounted price of approximately 90 million plus accrued and unpaid interest we wrote off about 02 million of unamortized costs related to the senior notes and recorded a gain on the repurchase in other income on our consolidated statement of operations the company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under our 650 million revolving line of credit on july 1 2008 the company repurchased all 115 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2625 convertible senior debentures issued in 2003 and due 2023 securities pursuant to the terms of the debentures for the securities and therefore no securities remain outstanding see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the company paid the aggregate repurchase price from borrowings under our 650 million revolving line of credit on july 1 2008 we also wrote off 30 million of unamortized costs related to the securities 

  

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

  

   

as of october 31 2009 the scheduled maturities of the company’s fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 

  

   

as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2009 it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time as of october 31 2009 the company has interest rate swaps outstanding that are designed to fix the borrowing costs related to all 425 million of the outstanding balance on the company’s syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points annual interest expense would remain unchanged

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 develops manufactures and markets healthcare products primarily medical devices through its two business units coopervision inc cvi and coopersurgical inc csi 

  

cvi develops manufactures and markets a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market its leading products are disposable spherical and specialty contact lenses 

  

cvi is a leading manufacturer of toric lenses which correct astigmatism multifocal lenses for presbyopia blurring near vision due to advancing age and spherical lenses including silicone hydrogel lenses that correct the most common visual defects cvi’s products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico norfolk virginia and scottsville new york cvi distributes products out of rochester new york the united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

  

csi develops manufactures and markets medical devices diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians csi’s products are primarily manufactured and distributed at its facilities in trumbull connecticut and stafford texas 

  

cvi and csi each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

we compete in the worldwide soft contact lens market and service the three primary regions of the americas emea europe middle east and africa and asia pacific including japan the contact lens market has two major product segments 

  

   

   

in order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear products are sold with recommended replacement schedules otherwise defined as modalities with the primary modalities being singleuse twoweek and monthly 

  

cvi offers both spherical and specialty lens products in most of the primary modalities we estimate the worldwide market for contact lenses by modality is 34 percent singleuse 39 percent twoweek and 27 percent monthly to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility provides cvi with competitive advantage by 

  

   

   

in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through its use of the lens edge technology provided under the patents covered by its edge patent license described under “patents trademarks and licensing agreements” below 

  

cooper’s proclear ® line of spherical toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates a proprietary phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

the market for contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials which as measured by their “dkt” score supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea than traditional hydrogel lenses has grown significantly and this material is a major product material in the industry cvi has launched biofinity and avaira silicone hydrogel spherical contact lens products in the united states europe and asia pacific excluding japan we plan to launch a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens under the biofinity label in the first half of calendar 2009 and a twoweek silicone hydrogel toric under the avaira label at the end of calendar 2009 

  

in addition to growing silicone hydrogel manufacturing capacity capabilities and sales cvi continues to compete against silicone hydrogel products with its pc technology™ and singleuse products and with traditional hydrogel products utilizing advanced design technologies 

  

contact lens products 

  

spheres cvi’s reported spherical lens revenue grew 16 percent in fiscal 2008 with disposable sphere growth of 18 percent and singleuse sphere growth of 45 percent – representing 18 percent of cvi’s soft lens revenue cvi’s silicone hydrogel spherical lens revenue for fiscal 2008 was 583 million or 6 percent of cvi’s soft lens revenue revenue for spherical lenses excluding singleuse grew 6 percent and represents 41 percent of cvi’s soft lens revenue 

  

specialty cvi’s reported specialty lenses – which are toric cosmetic and multifocal lenses – grew 10 percent in fiscal 2008 sales of cvi’s toric lenses grew 8 percent in fiscal 2008 and account for 33 percent of its soft lens revenue disposable toric lenses grew 11 percent multifocal lens sales grew 23 percent 

  

proclear cvi’s pc technology™ products – its line of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics xc™ and proclear 1 day – continued market share gains as sales increased 30 percent in fiscal 2008 proclear toric sales grew 39 percent proclear spheres grew 22 percent and proclear multifocal lenses grew 40 percent 

  

cvi fiscal 2008 revenue growth by geographic market 

  

in many geographic markets it is our belief that favorable demographic trends an increase in the reported incidence of myopia due in part to the recently described “computer vision syndrome” lower contact lens wearer drop out rates as technology improves and a continuing shift in practitioner preferences from lowfeatured “commodity” lenses to highervalue specialty and singleuse lenses support a favorable world market outlook this includes a trend to fitting silicone hydrogel lenses 

  

cvi’s worldwide revenue grew 12 percent in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 with the americas region up 8 percent and now representing 43 percent of cvi’s fiscal 2008 worldwide revenue emea up 13 percent representing 39 percent of worldwide revenue and the asia pacific region up 24 percent representing 18 percent of worldwide revenue 

  

americas 

  

we estimate the americas market by modality is 10 percent singleuse 65 percent twoweek and 25 percent monthly cvi americas revenue growth was driven by sales of silicone hydrogel lenses biofinity and avaira totaling 345 million pc technology lens sales increasing 20 percent and all singleuse spherical lens sales increasing 121 percent 

  

emea 

  

we estimate the emea market by modality is 38 percent singleuse 12 percent twoweek and 50 percent monthly emea revenue growth was driven by sales of biofinity lenses totaling 219 million pc technology lens sales up 39 percent and all singleuse spherical lens sales up 51 percent cvi estimates that it is the second largest contact lens supplier in europe with direct business units in france germany holland hungary italy netherlands norway portugal spain sweden and the united kingdom 

  

asia pacific 

  

we estimate the asia pacific market by modality is 57 percent singleuse 28 percent twoweek and 15 percent monthly asia pacific revenue growth was driven by sales of singleuse spherical and toric lens up 38 percent monthly spherical lens sales including biofinity up 109 percent and monthly toric sales up 63 percent 

  

cvi competition 

  

the contact lens market is highly competitive cvi’s three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical lens market are johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

recent trends in the spherical lens market include a shift towards silicone hydrogel lenses primarily in the united states and europe and toward singleuse lenses cvi’s primary competitors currently control the majority of the silicone hydrogel market cvi is taking market share with its monthly and twoweek spherical lens offerings but its market share is still lagging due to the late entry of these products into the market cvi also does not have the rights to market or sell our current silicone hydrogel products in japan 

  

in the specialty lens market cvi’s primary toric competitors are bausch  lomb and johnson  johnson vision care inc toric lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners cvi believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors providing greater choices for patient and practitioner and better visual acuity and that it offers superior customer services including high standards of ontime product delivery however 

  

there is a developing trend in the us toric lens market toward silicone hydrogel products cvi initiated manufacturing of a silicone hydrogel monthly toric product during fiscal year 2008 with the product launch scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2009 a second silicone hydrogel toric product is scheduled to launch at the end of calendar 2009 

  

cvi’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces nevertheless cvi offers a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the company’s lens products cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well equipped through extensive training to meet the needs of contact lens practitioners and their customers 

  

cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects cvi believes that it will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share cvi also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales of contact lenses because each modality serves a different age group cvi believes that almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties while refractive surgery patients are typically in their late thirties or early forties when their vision has stabilized 

  

coopersurgical 

  

since its beginning in 1990 csi has successfully established a leading position among companies providing medical device products to the obstetrics and gynecology medical specialty historically many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system csi’s strategy has been and continues to be to identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that will improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas csi has grown to 168 million in revenue through a series of more than 25 acquisitions during the past five years csi’s revenue grew at a compounded rate of 15 percent with doubledigit operating margins and minimal capital expenditure requirements 

  

market for women’s healthcare 

  

based on united states census estimates csi expects patient visits to united states obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is a large group of women of childbearing age and a rapidly growing middleaged population with emerging gynecologic concerns consistent with an aging population menopausal problems – abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis – are expected to increase while pregnancy contraceptive management and general examinations are expected to remain relatively stable the trend toward delaying the age of childbearing to the midthirties and beyond will likely drive increasing treatment for infertility 

  

while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

csi’s 2008 revenue growth 

  

during 2008 csi revenue grew 9 percent to 1683 million from 1548 million in 2007 representing 16 percent of cooper’s revenue in both periods fiscal 2008 organic growth was 6 and sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 19 and represent 30 of csi’s total revenue 

  

csi competition 

  

csi focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances csi offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure the market segments in which csi competes remains fragmented typified by smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

  

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi believes that it competes successfully against these companies with its superior sales and marketing the technological advantages of its products and by developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as csi expands its product line it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

  

csi is expanding its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure market this market is dominated by larger competitors such as johnson  johnson’s ethicon endosurgery and ethicon women’s health and urology companies boston scientific gyrus and acmi these competitors have well established positions within the operating room environment csi believes its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecology surgery will facilitate its expansion within the surgical market 

  

research and development 

  

cooper employs 151 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments primarily in cvi external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support product development and clinical research for cvi products cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop silicone hydrogel products product lines utilizing pc technology™ and expansion of singleuse product lines csi conducts research and development inhouse and also employs external surgical specialists including members of its surgical advisory board csi’s fiscal 2008 research and development activities were for laparoscopic surgical devices and upgrading and redesign of many csi osteoporoses invitro fertilization incontinence and assisted reproductive technology products and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities 

  

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during the fiscal years ended october 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 355 million 327 million and 270 million net of 2007 and 2006 acquired inprocess research and development of 72 million and 75 million respectively net research and development expenditures represented 3 of net sales in each fiscal year during fiscal 2008 cvi represented 87 and csi represented 13 of the total expenditures we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur for example to qualify our new silicone hydrogel contact lens products for extended wear use we believe that more extensive premarket testing and approval would be required 

  

device classification 

  

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes – class i ii or iii – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require substantially lower levels of regulation 

  

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda’s general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda’s quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

  

class ii devices are subject to the fda’s general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma as of october 2002 unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

  

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described 

  

above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

  

510k clearance pathway 

  

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

  

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained also in these circumstances a manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

  

premarket approval pathway 

  

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device 

  

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

  

clinical trials 

  

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

  

continuing fda regulation 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

  

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

foreign regulation 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 9000 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

other health care regulation 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and result in operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

antikickback and fraud law 

  

our operations may be subject to antikickback laws the federal antikickback statutes which are commonly known collectively as the medicare fraud and abuse statute prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid the definition of “remuneration” under this statute has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value including such items as gifts discounts waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value while we believe most sales of our products are not subject to the federal antikickback statutes many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal antikickback statutes some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source not only by the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

in addition to establishing federal privacy security and transaction standards the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created two new fraud and abuse laws the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payors the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services this statute applies to any health benefit plan not just medicare and medicaid additionally hipaa granted expanded enforcement authority to health and human services hhs and the us department of justice doj and provided enhanced resources to support the activities and responsibilities of the office of inspector general oig and doj by authorizing large increases in funding for investigating fraud and abuse violations relating to healthcare delivery and payment 

  

physician selfreferral laws 

  

we may also be subject to federal and state physician selfreferral laws the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly known as the stark law prohibits subject to certain exceptions physician referrals of medicare and medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts various states have corollary laws to the stark law including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state 

  

false claims laws 

  

under separate statutes submission of claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid andor federallyfunded state health programs these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 5500 and 11000 for each separate false claim suits filed under the false claims act known as “qui tam” actions can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals known as “relators” or more commonly as “whistleblowers” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement in addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action pay fines or be excluded from the medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action 

  

raw materials 

  

cvi’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials there are alternative supply sources for all of our raw materials other than our silicone hydrogel material asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products comfilcon a if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi 

  

raw materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

marketing and distribution 

  

in the united states cvi markets its products through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors cvi augments its us sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in professional journals in 

  

australia canada china france germany holland hungary italy japan korea malaysia norway portugal singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom cvi primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries cvi uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products 

  

csi’s products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales and marketing activities with ecommerce telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

  

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

  

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of cooper’s products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper aggressively protects its intellectual property rights 

  

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than 

  

   

   

   

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

  

dependence on customers 

  

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 

  

government contracts 

  

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

  

backlog 

  

backlog is not a material factor in either of cooper’s business units 

  

seasonality 

  

cvi’s contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

  

compliance with environmental laws 

  

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect cooper’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock could decline these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

  

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens segment cvi faces intense competition from competitors’ products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business johnson  johnson vision care inc ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than cvi 

  

our major competitors in the specialty contact lens business offer competitive products and newer materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses moreover silicone hydrogel lenses are gaining market acceptance in the specialty lens business particularly in the us market and we have not yet introduced our own competitive silicone hydrogel specialty products which could erode our specialty lens market share and margins 

  

the market for our nonspecialty commodity contact lenses is also intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to successfully introduce new products on a timely basis in markets such as the united states europe and japan and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to a lesser extent cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

  

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that our competitors’ newer specialty lens products will not successfully erode cvi’s highermargin specialty lens business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in the women’s healthcare segment competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche markets some of which have 

  

substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

  

current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business 

  

in the united states and globally current market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth for our fiscal year ended october 31 2008 economists have declared that the us economy is in a recession facing continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and a declining real estate market countries globally are affected by similar systemic impacts we experienced a slow down in contact lens sales particularly in the us market in october and november of 2008 and current economic conditions and recessionary pressures have lowered our expectations for 2009 

  

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers continued turbulence in the united states and international market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

if current market conditions do not improve the demand for contact lenses may materially decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence 

  

product innovations are important in the contact lens business in which cvi competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which csi competes historically we did not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others however since 2005 we have been investing more in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

  

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure that any of them will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity and product sales of our biofinity avaira and proclear 1 day products which we view as key products to drive our future growth in addition while our competitors have successfully introduced silicone hydrogel specialty contact lens products we have not commercially marketed our planned silicone hydrogel specialty contact lens products market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

  

technological developments in the eye care and women’s healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances were to provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our current operations for cvi are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately 63 and 61 of our net sales for cvi for the years ended october 31 2008 and 2007 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states further we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

  

acquisitions that we may make may involve numerous risks 

  

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at csi we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective while we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products our failure to continue to develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete 

  

cvi manufactures molded contact lenses which represent a significant portion of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico and norfolk virginia csi manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut and stafford texas we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

  

cvi distributes products out of rochester new york and the united kingdom and various smaller international distribution facilities csi’s products are primarily distributed out of its facility in trumbull connecticut any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted and our product sales and profitability could suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fda’s qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and 

  

comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used by us are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the primary material comfilcon a used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products biofinity and avaira if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi a disruption in the supply of comfilcon a could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

  

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property our business could suffer 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

  

   

   

   

   

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged 

  

invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further we cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

  

we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information furthermore enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies we could lose competitive advantage and be materially adversely affected 

  

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks also we might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

  

the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our intellectual property could be subject to claims of infringement 

  

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products claims that our products infringe the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales incorporating our technology 

  

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry third parties have made and it is possible that they will make in the future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology see part i item 3 legal proceedings bausch  lomb any claims even those without merit could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

  

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

  

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand in addition consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing product in the future 

  

we face risks in connection with securities litigation 

  

the company and several of its directors and officers have been named in a consolidated putative securities class action lawsuit and its directors and certain of its officers have been named in two consolidated derivative lawsuits the nature and status of which are described in item 3 legal proceedings the consolidated putative securities class action seeks unspecified damages from the company and we are unable to estimate the range of potential losses that would be incurred if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail or to determine the total effect that it may have on our results of operations financial position and cash flows however any settlement or judgment on the merits of this action could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity results of operations and financial condition in addition securities litigation irrespective of its merits is costly to defend and diverts management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

  

the purported derivative lawsuits which are at a very preliminary stage do not seek damages from the company however derivative litigation is costly and these lawsuits may divert management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

  

we face risks related to environmental matters 

  

our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of 

  

hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

  

we are conducting a voluntary cleanup at one of our sites in the state of new york although the workplan that we submitted to the state has been approved and we believe that the cleanup is proceeding in accordance with the workplan and our expectations there can be no assurance that the cleanup will be completed within the timeframe and cost projected that the expected results will be achieved or that we will not identify alternate sources or higher levels of contamination as such there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection therewith 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

  

our substantial indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit facility and senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests in addition current conditions in the global debt markets would make it difficult and costly to refinance our credit facility and senior notes our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment 

  

obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to effectively manage our risks which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results 

  

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the pound sterling euro japanese yen and canadian dollar we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely these hedges also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations finally because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

  

we may be required to recognize impairment charges on goodwill which would reduce our net income consolidated net worth and stockholders’ equity 

  

pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a charge for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings in a period of such change in addition such charges would reduce our consolidated net income if such charges were included in our covenant calculations it could result in noncompliance with certain financial covenants under our credit facilities in the period of such charge 

  

we performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2008 and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill as a result of the decline in the price of our common stock in the fiscal fourth quarter 2008 to a value below the company’s per share book value including goodwill and given the present stock price volatility and uncertainty surrounding the global economy the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2008 and determined that no impairment existed in either of its reporting units as of such date we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows and income valuation approach in bridging our market capitalization we used an average closing price of our common stock and we applied a control premium based on our review of our premiums paid by third parties in comparable recent transactions management will continue to monitor the relationship of cooper’s market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value and to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and the company will perform its required annual goodwill impairment test during the fiscal third quarter 2009 

  

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if cooper’s common stock price continues to trade below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or if the annual goodwill impairment test 

  

indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and which could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely effect our total assets stockholders’ equity and financial position 

  

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws in addition the internal revenue service irs has been auditing the company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 – 2007 and we are also subject to the examination of its income tax returns by other tax authorities the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

failure to utilize us net operating losses could negatively impact our statement of operations 

  

at october 31 2008 we had us net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately 818 million approximately 69 million of the nols expire in fiscal 2009 although we presently anticipate utilizing the entire nol in our tax filings significant and unanticipated changes in our projected us taxable income may result in our not fully utilizing the nol should this occur the tax effect of the unutilized nol would be reflected as a noncashrelated tax provision on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

we are in the process of upgrading certain of our management information systems and we cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruption of our business 

  

we have implemented a management information system at our major locations and are in the process of implementing related systems for substantially all of our businesses worldwide many other companies have had severe problems with computer system implementations of this nature and scope we are using a controlled project plan and we believe we have assigned adequate staffing and other resources to the projects to ensure successful implementation however we cannot assure that the design will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as designed we are heavily dependent on such computer systems and any failure or delay in the system implementation would cause a substantial interruption to our business additional expense and loss of sales customers and profits 

  

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing and engineering personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

  

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

  

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we will also be afforded the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquiror to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of the our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

  

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

  

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

  

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s design development testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

  

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

  

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires 

  

us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

development and marketing of our products is subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse affect on our business 

  

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations due to the movement towards harmonization of standards in the european union we expect a changing regulatory environment in europe characterized by a shift from a country bycountry regulatory system to a european unionwide single regulatory system we cannot currently predict the timing of this harmonization our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fda’s qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing or labeling errors or design defects any voluntary or government mandated recall may divert management attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers any recall involving one of our products could also harm the reputation of the product and the company and would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 

  

changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors’ efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the federal and state governments these proposals could affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level among the proposals under consideration are price controls on hospitals insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses requirements that companies that sell products to hospitals and other healthcare providers must publicly disclose their prices requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of a government health insurance plan or plans that would cover all citizens 

  

there also continue to be efforts at the federal level to introduce various insurance market reforms expanded fraud and abuse and antireferral legislation and further reductions in medicare and medicaid coverage and reimbursement a broad range of both similar and more comprehensive healthcare reform initiatives is likely to be considered at the state level although it is uncertain which if any of these or other proposals will be adopted the potential for adoption of these proposals affects or may affect our ability to market our products 

  

any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches in addition we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

  

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

furthermore widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain medical products including the voluntary recalls of certain contact lens solutions in 2006 and 2007 by bausch  lomb and advanced medical optics respectively may cause regulatory authorities members of congress the government accounting office medical professionals and the general public to raise concerns about potential medical product safety issues this increased attention may result in increased regulation and scrutiny of medical devices such as for example the food and drug administration amendment act of 2007 which was recently enacted providing for the establishment of a unique system for identifying medical devices among other provisions 

  

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices hhs has released three rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the first rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the second rule released by hhs imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information these standards not only require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information but they also require an entity subject to hipaa to obtain satisfactory assurances that any of its business associates to whom such information is disclosed will safeguard the information the third rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information while we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under hipaa many of our customers are covered entities subject to hipaa such customers may require us to enter into business associate agreements which obligate us to safeguard certain health information we obtain in the course of servicing their customers restrict the manner in which we use and disclose such information and impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws physician selfreferral laws and false claims laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if there is a change in law regulation administrative or judicial interpretation we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

results of operations 

  

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

  

outlook 

  

we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical phosphorylcholine pc technology™ silicone hydrogel and specialty contact lenses we believe that market demographics are favorable with the reported incidence of myopia continuing to increase worldwide and with the teenage population in the united states the age when most contact lens wear begins projected to grow considerably over the next two decades cvi expects greater market penetration in europe and asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses 

  

we are in the process of developing and launching a number of new contact lens products to enhance cvi’s broad and competitive product lines new products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and pc technology materials and new lens designs including toric and multifocal lenses we also plan to launch our proclear 1 day a singleuse spherical lens in japan during the first calendar quarter of 2009 

  

sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials a major product material in the industry have grown significantly the company has launched biofinity and avaira silicone hydrogel spherical contact lens products in the united states europe and asia pacific excluding japan we plan to launch a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens under the biofinity label in the first quarter of 2009 and a twoweek silicone hydrogel toric under the avaira label at the end of calendar 2009 while initial customer reaction from biofinity and avaira has been favorable our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel market we have achieved sufficient manufacturing capacity of biofinity and avaira to support our business plan for both products however we face challenges associated with manufacturing using a new material and ramping up production volumes reducing costs and improving efficiencies we believe that our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products will be an important factor affecting future levels of sales growth and profitability 

  

while we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for the worldwide contact lens market recent events affecting the economy as a whole including the uncertainty and instability of the us and international credit markets and recessionary pressures in the united states have lowered our expectations for fiscal year 2009 we experienced slower than expected sales in october and november of 2008 and we are receiving anecdotal evidence that consumers may be changing their buying habits and extending the use of contact lenses beyond prescribed limits we believe that these changes are temporary responses to current economic conditions and we expect the contact lens market to recover with a recovery in the broader economy

cvi’s sga increased 6 in 2008 primarily due to costs supporting increased sales levels and lenses used in marketing programs and 13 in 2007 primarily due to costs related to the rationalization of distribution centers lenses used in marketing programs and intellectual property litigation sga as a percentage of net sales decreased to 38 in 2008 from 40 in 2007 and 39 in 2006

corporate headquarters’ sga which decreased 8 to 291 million in 2008 but increased 9 to 315 million in 2007 were 3 of consolidated net sales in both periods the decrease in 2008 was primarily due to expense recovery related to forfeitures of sharebased awards the growth in 2007 was primarily due to sharebased compensation expense the growth since 2006 includes continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the company’s global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements

provision for income taxes 

  

we recorded tax expense of 107 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to 119 million for fiscal year 2007 our geographic mix of income changed during 2008 with a decrease in profitability in high tax jurisdictions offset by certain expenses associated with the ocular integration plan that impacted jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

  

sharebased compensation plans 

  

the company grants various stockbased compensation awards including stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units the sharebased compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2008 was 149 million and 40 million respectively compared to 177 million and 43 million respectively if fiscal year 2007 as of october 31 2008 there was 376 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 203 years for nonvested stock options and 217 years for restricted stock units cash received from options exercised under all sharebased compensation arrangements for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was 63 million and 93 million respectively 

  

the company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the blackscholes valuation model which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life stock price volatility and other assumptions groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catchup adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed during fiscal year 2008 these adjustments totaled 32 million

comparative statistics 

  

   

operating cash flows 

  

cash flow provided from operating activities continued as cooper’s major source of liquidity totaling 965 million in fiscal 2008 and 1340 million in 2007 operating cash flow decreased as we have utilized cash to build inventory in support of new product launches including lenses for use in marketing programs payment of income taxes and reduction of accounts payable net of accounts payable related to capital expenditures 

  

the increase in working capital in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to our adoption of fin 48 which resulted in a reclassification of certain shortterm tax liabilities to long term see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and the building of inventories to support new product launches and increasing sales levels increases in our longterm borrowings and accounts receivable and a decrease in other accrued liabilities also contributed to the increase cash used to pay for capital equipment while significantly less than the prior year reduced working capital 

  

at the end of fiscal 2008 cooper’s inventory months on hand moh were 80 compared to 59 at fiscal yearend 2007 however our adjusted fiscal 2007 moh was 74 net of 273 million of charges to costs of sales recorded in our fiscal fourth quarter 2007 associated with our ocular integration plan as we continued to build inventory in support of new product launches and distribution center consolidations also our days sales outstanding dso decreased to 58 days at october 31 2008 from 60 days at october 31 2007 based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable

investing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 1288 million from investing activities in fiscal 2008 was driven by payments of 39 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of 1249 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity consolidate distribution centers and continue the rollout of new information systems 

  

financing cash flows 

  

the cash inflow of 312 million from financing activities in fiscal 2008 was driven by net proceeds from longterm debt of 294 million and 63 million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by payment of shortterm debt of 35 million and dividends on our common stock of 27 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2008 

  

risk management 

  

most of our operations outside the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally our pound sterling euro and japanese yendenominated debt and receivables and from operations in foreign currencies we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit varies with the london interbank offered rate our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through may 2011 for additional detail see item 1a risk factors and note 1 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

on january 31 2007 cooper entered into a 650 million syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit revolver and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 7125 of senior notes see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements keybank led the revolver refinancing and the revolver matures on january 31 2012 

  

in connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

  

outlook – global market and economic conditions 

  

in the united states and globally recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth through into the fourth quarter of 2008 for our fiscal year ended october 31 2008 continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit bank failures and a

declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us and the global economy these conditions combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have in recent weeks near and subsequent to the end of the fiscal year contributed to substantial declines in capital markets and consumer confidence 

  

as a result of these market conditions the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers if these market conditions continue they may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs resulting in potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations these conditions may also affect the markets for our products as consumers may curtail buying habits similar to the slower than expected contact lens sales in october and november 2008 

  

we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of 19 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends and small acquisitions management believes that our projected outlook on sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months at october 31 2008 we had 1384 million available under our 650 million syndicated bank credit facility

we performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2008 and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill as a result of the decline in the price of our common stock in the fiscal fourth quarter 2008 to a value below the company’s per share book value including goodwill and given the present stock price volatility and uncertainty surrounding the global economy the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of october 31 2008 and determined that no impairment existed in either of its reporting units as of such date we determined the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows an income valuation approach we used a discount rate of a representative weighted average cost of capital for our business segments in comparison with guideline companies with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy 

  

in bridging our market capitalization we used an average closing price of our common stock and we applied a premium for control based on our review of premiums paid by third parties in comparable recent transactions based on the facts and circumstances of the particular market conditions that occurred in the final month of our fiscal year and that were not in existence at the time of our annual impairment test we used an average closing price of our common stock that represented the period from our release of our results of operations for our fiscal third quarter 2008 through our fiscal yearend or 56 days we determined an appropriate premium for control by analyzing individual transactions in our markets and selected target companies whose operations were comparable to our two business segments management will continue to monitor the relationship of cooper’s market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value and to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and the company will perform its required annual goodwill impairment test during the fiscal third quarter 2009 

  

goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment if our common stock price continues to trade below book value per share there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business or if the annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill the company may have to recognize a noncash impairment of its goodwill that could be material and which could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets stockholders’ equity and financial condition

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

   

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

  

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 fin 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 on november 1 2007 under fin 48 the company recognizes the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position fin 48 clarifies how the company measures the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits fin 48 also addresses when the company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within our consolidated statement of operations and presented in the consolidated balance sheet in connection with the adoption of fin 48 on november 1 2007 the company continued its classification policy of interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense also we were required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained or may only partially be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 

  

   

under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating cooper’s stock price volatility employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 

  

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical implied volatility of the company’s publiclytraded options historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the us treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

  

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

  

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas 123r the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period in 2005 prior to the adoption of sfas 123r the company valued its sharebased compensation using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and related interpretations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

  

the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the company’s policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes for additional information please see risk management discussed above in capital resources and liquidity and “derivatives” in note 1 and note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

longterm debt 

  

total debt increased to 9048 million at october 31 2008 from 8766 million at october 31 2007 longterm debt includes 350 million of senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements on july 1 the company repurchased all 115 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2625 convertible senior debentures issued in 2003 and due 2023 securities pursuant to the terms of the indenture for the securities see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements the terms of the indenture included a put option that entitled each holder of the securities to require the company to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s securities at a price equal to 1000 in cash per 1000 of principal amount of securities plus accrued and unpaid interest the company accepted all of these securities for repurchase and therefore no securities remain outstanding the company paid the aggregate repurchase price from borrowings under its 650 million revolving line of credit on july 1 2008 we also wrote off 30 million of unamortized costs related to the securities 

  

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

  

   

as of october 31 2008 the scheduled maturities of the company’s fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations excluding immaterial capitalized leases their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 

  

   

as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2008 it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time we entered into interest rate swaps designed to fix the borrowing costs related to 525 million of the company’s syndicated bank credit facility and subsequently reduced the notional amount of interest rate swaps to 450 million as of october 31 2008 if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by approximately 600 thousand annually

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 develops manufactures and markets healthcare products primarily medical devices through its two business units coopervision inc cvi and coopersurgical inc csi 

  

cvi develops manufactures and markets a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market its leading products are disposable spherical and specialty contact lenses 

  

cvi is a leading manufacturer of toric lenses which correct astigmatism multifocal lenses for presbyopia blurring near vision due to advancing age and spherical lenses that correct the most common visual defects cvi’s products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico norfolk virginia and scottsville new york cvi distributes products out of rochester new york the united kingdom liege belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities 

  

csi develops manufactures and markets medical devices diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians csi’s products are primarily manufactured and distributed at its facility in trumbull connecticut 

  

cvi and csi each operate in highly competitive environments competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

we estimate that the worldwide soft contact lens market will grow about 9 percent 6 percent in constant currency during calendar 2007 to about 52 billion annually in the americas which we estimate is about 41 percent of the worldwide market we estimate that the market will grow about 8 percent to 21 billion and in europe which we estimate is about 29 percent of the market we estimate that the market will grow about 11 percent 1 percent in constant currency to 15 billion we estimate that japan and asia pacific countries about 16 billion or 30 percent of the world market will grow about 8 percent 10 percent in constant currency 

  

the contact lens market has two major segments the spherical lens segment which we estimate is about 39 billion or 74 percent of the calendar 2007 worldwide contact lens market includes lenses that correct uncomplicated near and farsightedness we estimate that products recommended for one day of wear singleuse lenses account for about 43 percent of spherical lens revenue the specialty lens segment which we estimate at 13 billion or 26 of the 2007 worldwide contact lens market includes lenses that meet special needs of contact lens patients toric cosmetic and multifocal lenses cvi offers both specialty lenses and spherical lenses 

  

historically cvi has shown strength in the specialty lens segments which include toric lenses cosmetic lenses and multifocal lenses with the ocular acquisition cvi gained a significant presence in the largest segment of the contact lens market spherical lenses that correct the most common types of visual defects near and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects 

  

to compete successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens market companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently cvi believes that it 

  

is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility provides cvi with competitive advantage by 

  

   

   

in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through its use of the lens edge technology provided under the patents covered by its edge patent license described under “patents trademarks and licensing agreements” below 

  

cooper’s proclear ® line of spherical multifocal and toric lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates a proprietary phosphorylcholine pc technology™ that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear ® lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

in many geographic markets it is our belief that favorable demographic trends in younger cohorts an increase in the reported incidence of myopia due in part to the recently described “computer vision syndrome” lower contact lens wearer drop out rates as technology improves and a continuing shift in practitioner preferences from lowfeatured “commodity” lenses to highervalue specialty and singleuse lenses support a favorable world market outlook this includes a trend primarily in the united states to fitting silicone hydrogel lenses which as measured by their “dkt” score supply a higher level of oxygen to the cornea than traditional hydrogel lenses 

  

to participate in these market trends cvi continues to leverage the january 6 2005 acquisition of ocular sciences inc ocular that provided access to new technologies particularly patented silicone hydrogel and singleuse lens technologies new geographic markets particularly japan and germany and higher volume manufacturing processes particularly the gen ii manufacturing platform gen ii 

  

cvi is in the process of developing sufficient manufacturing capabilities to compete in the market for silicone hydrogel lenses which we estimate accounts for 26 percent or 13 billion of the worldwide contact lens market 

  

contact lens products 

  

cvi’s core product lines include specialty lenses – which are toric cosmetic and multifocal lenses – plus pc technology™ brand spherical lenses silicone hydrogel spherical lenses and singleuse lenses worldwide cvi’s core lens revenue grew 16 percent in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 sales of cvi’s toric lenses grew 8 percent in fiscal 2007 and now account for about 35 percent of its soft lens revenue disposable toric lenses grew 13 percent we estimate that the worldwide toric market will grow about 16 percent in calendar 2007 cvi’s pc technology™ products – its line of spherical toric and multifocal products including biomedics xc™ and proclear ® 1 day – grew 33 percent in fiscal 2007 

  

we estimate that the market for spherical contact lenses will grow 8 percent worldwide during calendar 2007 driven in part by the acceptance of newer silicone hydrogel lenses we estimate that worldwide silicone hydrogel revenue will increase about 29 percent during calendar 2007 approximately twothirds of which will be generated in the united states cvi began marketing its biofinity ® brand of silicone hydrogel spherical contact lenses in europe the united states and selected markets in asia pacific in fiscal 2007 and continues to develop its manufacturing capabilities to participate in this market cvi’s reported spherical revenue grew 8 percent in fiscal 2007 to 4575 million singleuse sphere revenue grew 29 percent in fiscal 2007 and now represents 14 percent of cvi’s soft lens revenue 

  

in addition to growing biofinity ® manufacturing capacity capabilities and sales cvi continues to compete against silicone hydrogel products with its pc technology™ and singleuse products and with traditional hydrogel products utilizing advanced design technologies 

  

cvi fiscal 2007 revenue growth by geographic market 

  

cvi’s worldwide revenue grew 8 percent in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 with the americas region up 2 percent and now representing 45 percent of its fiscal 2007 worldwide revenue europe up 12 percent and representing 39 percent of cvi’s fiscal 2007 worldwide revenue and the asia pacific region up 18 percent and representing 16 percent of cvi’s fiscal 2007 worldwide revenue 

  

americas 

  

americas revenue growth slowed due to the market shift to silicone hydrogel lenses and a one percent decline in toric revenue in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 overall revenue growth was driven by sales of singleuse spherical lenses which grew 143 percent and multifocal lenses which grew 26 percent biofinity ® lens sales were 25 million in fiscal 2007 

  

europe 

  

european revenue growth was driven by sales of toric lenses which grew 18 percent in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 singleuse lenses which grew 25 percent and multifocal lenses which grew 19 percent cvi estimates that it is the second largest contact lens supplier in europe with direct business units in france germany holland hungary italy netherlands norway portugal spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom 

  

asia pacific 

  

japan is the second largest contact lens market in the world after the united states and soft lens popularity continues to grow cvi estimates that the total market for soft contact lenses in japan and asia pacific countries today is about 16 billion compared to an estimated 21 billion in the americas the japanese market is largely made up of singleuse lenses which we estimate represents about 56 percent of the market 

  

we believe that the incidence of nearsightedness in japan is one of the highest in the world and based on our experience about half of those with astigmatism are potential candidates for toric lenses we expect that the japanese toric segment currently a smaller percentage of the total market than it is in the united states will grow rapidly as newer generations of toric lenses are introduced 

  

asia pacific revenue growth was driven by sales of singleuse sphere and toric products which grew 28 percent in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and represented 59 percent of cvi’s sales in the region 

  

cvi competition 

  

the contact lens market is highly competitive cvi’s three largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical lens market are johnson  johnson’s vistakon division vistakon ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

recent trends in the spherical lens market include a shift towards silicone hydrogel lenses primarily in the united states and toward singleuse lenses cvi’s primary competitors currently control almost all of the silicone hydrogel market as cvi continues to develop its silicone hydrogel manufacturing capabilities 

  

in the specialty lens market cvi’s primary toric competitors are bausch  lomb and vistakon toric lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners cvi believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors providing greater choices for patient and practitioner and better visual acuity and that it offers superior customer services including high standards of ontime product delivery however there is a developing trend in the us toric lens market toward silicone hydrogel products cvi has not launched a silicone hydrogel toric product and does not expect to do so until late calendar 2008 

  

cvi’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces nevertheless cvi offers a high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the company’s lens products cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well equipped through extensive training to meet the needs of contact lens practitioners and their customers 

  

cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects cvi believes that it will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share cvi also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales of contact lenses because each modality serves a different age group cvi believes that almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties while refractive surgery patients are typically in their late thirties or early forties when their vision has stabilized 

  

coopersurgical 

  

since its beginning in 1990 csi has successfully established a leading position among companies providing medical device products to the obstetrics and gynecology medical specialty historically many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system csi’s strategy has been and continues to be to identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that will improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas csi has grown to over 150 million in revenue through a series of more than 25 acquisitions during the past five years csi’s revenue grew at a compounded rate of 17 

  

percent with doubledigit operating margins and minimal capital expenditure requirements cooper’s strong cash flow allows csi to readily compete for available opportunities in both the office and hospital markets 

  

market for women’s healthcare 

  

based on us census estimates csi expects patient visits to united states obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns to increase over the next decade driving this growth is a large group of women of childbearing age and a rapidly growing middleaged population with emerging gynecologic concerns consistent with an aging population menopausal problems – abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis – are expected to increase while pregnancy contraceptive management and general examinations are expected to remain relatively stable the trend toward delaying the age of childbearing to the midthirties and beyond will likely drive increasing treatment for infertility 

  

while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care the obgyn specialist is the primary market for associated medical devices 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

csi’s 2007 revenue growth 

  

during 2007 csi revenue grew 24 percent to 1548 million representing 16 percent of cooper’s revenue its operating margin was 13 percent for the fiscal year including a 72 million or 5 percent charge for acquired inprocess research and development compared to last year’s 12 percent operating margin that included a 75 million or 6 charge for acquired inprocess research and development 

  

csi competition 

  

csi focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances csi offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure the market segments in which csi competes remains fragmented typified by smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper 

  

competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and 

  

hospitals csi believes that it competes successfully against these companies with its superior sales and marketing the technological advantages of its products and by developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as csi expands its product line it also offers to train medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products 

  

csi is expanding its presence in the significantly larger hospital and outpatient surgical procedure market this market is dominated by larger competitors such as johnson  johnson’s ethicon endosurgery and ethicon women’s health and urology companies boston scientific gyrus and acmi these competitors have well established positions within the operating room environment csi believes its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecology surgery will facilitate in its successful expansion within the surgical market 

  

profiles of recent acquisitions 

  

wallach surgical devices inc 

  

on february 22 2007 csi acquired all of the outstanding shares of wallach for 200 million in cash wallach’s products consist of various diagnostic and therapeutic medical instruments primarily for inoffice use in women’s healthcare and other specialty instruments relating to dermatology ophthalmology anesthesiology dentistry and veterinary medicine 

  

lone star medical products inc 

  

on november 2 2006 csi acquired all of the outstanding shares of lone star for 272 million in cash lone star is a manufacturer of medical devices that improve the management of the surgical site most notably the lone star retractor system™ which places a retraction ring around the surgical incision providing greater exposure of the surgical field while this system is used in a wide variety of surgical procedures gynecological surgery represents 40 of its use and urology 30 

  

research and development 

  

cooper employs 124 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments primarily in cvi external specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support product development and clinical research for cvi products cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop silicone hydrogel products product lines utilizing pc technology™ and expansion of singleuse product lines csi conducts research and development inhouse and also employs external surgical specialists including members of its surgical advisory board csi’s fiscal 2007 research and development activities were for newly acquired laparoscopic surgical devices and upgrading and redesign of many csi osteoporoses invitro fertilization incontinence and assisted reproductive technology products and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities 

  

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during the fiscal years ended october 31 2007 2006 and 2005 were 327 million 27 million and 229 million net of acquired inprocess research and development of 72 million 75 million and 200 million respectively net research and development expenditures represented 3 of net sales in each fiscal year during fiscal 2007 cvi represented 84 and csi represented 16 of the total expenditures net of acquired inprocess research and development we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs 

  

government regulation 

  

medical device regulation 

  

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur for example to qualify our new silicone hydrogel contact lens products for extended wear use we believe that more extensive premarket testing and approval would be required 

  

device classification 

  

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes – class i ii or iii – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require substantially lower levels of regulation 

  

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda’s general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda’s quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

  

class ii devices are subject to the fda’s general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 mdufma as of october 2002 unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

  

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

  

510k clearance pathway 

  

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if the fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

  

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained also in these circumstances we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

  

premarket approval pathway 

  

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device 

  

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

  

clinical trials 

  

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by 

  

appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by both the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

  

continuing fda regulation 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

  

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall seizure or import holds of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

foreign regulation 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 9000 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality 

  

programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

other health care regulation 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial conditions and result in operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 

  

antikickback and fraud law 

  

our operations may be subject to antikickback laws the federal antikickback statutes which are commonly known collectively as the medicare fraud and abuse statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid the definition of “remuneration” under this statute has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value including such items as gifts discounts waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value while we believe most sales of our products are not subject to the federal antikickback statutes many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal antikickback statutes some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source not only by the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

in addition to establishing federal privacy security and transaction standards hipaa created two new fraud and abuse laws the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payers the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services this statute applies to any health benefit plan not just medicare and medicaid additionally hipaa granted expanded enforcement authority to health and human services hhs and the us department of justice doj and provided enhanced resources to support the activities and responsibilities of the office of inspector general oig and doj by authorizing large increases in funding for investigating fraud and abuse violations relating to healthcare delivery and payment 

  

physician selfreferral laws 

  

we may also be subject to federal and state physician selfreferral laws the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly known as the stark law prohibits subject to certain exceptions physician referrals of medicare and medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health 

  

services” if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts various states have corollary laws to the stark law including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state 

  

false claims laws 

  

under separate statutes submission of claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid andor federallyfunded state health programs these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 5500 and 11000 for each separate false claim suits filed under the false claims act known as “qui tam” actions can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals known as “relators” or more commonly as “whistleblowers” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement in addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action pay fines or be excluded from the medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action 

  

raw materials 

  

cvi’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials there are alternative supply sources for all of our raw materials other than our silicone hydrogel material asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products comfilcon a if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi 

  

raw materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

marketing and distribution 

  

in the united states cvi markets its products through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors cvi augments its us sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in professional journals in australia canada china france germany holland hungary italy japan korea malaysia norway portugal singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland taiwan and the united kingdom cvi primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries cvi uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products 

  

csi’s products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales and marketing activities with ecommerce telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

  

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

  

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of cooper’s products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations cooper aggressively protects its intellectual property rights 

  

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than 

  

   

   

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

  

dependence on customers 

  

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 

  

government contracts 

  

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

  

backlog 

  

backlog is not a material factor in either of cooper’s business units 

  

seasonality 

  

cvi’s contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

  

compliance with environmental laws 

  

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect cooper’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

working capital 

  

cooper has not required any material working capital arrangements in the past five years

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock or convertible debentures could decline these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

  

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens segment cvi faces intense competition from competitors’ products in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than cvi 

  

our major competitors in the specialty contact lens business offer competitive products and newer materials plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses moreover silicone hydrogel lenses are gaining market acceptance in the specialty lens business and we are not yet able to manufacture and market our own competitive silicone hydrogel specialty products which could erode our specialty lens market share and margins 

  

the market for our nonspecialty commodity contact lenses is also intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to successfully introduce new products including our own silicone hydrogel products on a timely basis in markets such as the united states europe and japan and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to a lesser extent cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery 

  

there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that a successful entry into cvi’s highermargin specialty lens segments by a larger competitor would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

in the women’s healthcare segment competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche markets some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

  

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence 

  

product innovations are important in the contact lens business in which cvi competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which csi competes historically we did not allocate substantial resources to new product development but rather purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others however since 2005 we have been investing more in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogelbased contact lenses although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products failure to stay current with our competitors with regard to new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

  

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure you that any of them will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity and product sales of our biofinity ® and proclear ® 1 day products which we view as key products to drive our future growth in addition we have not commercially marketed many of our planned new products such as certain of our planned silicone hydrogel contact lens products market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products 

  

technological developments in the eye care and women’s healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease 

  

the demand for our optical products if these new advances were to provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our current operations for cvi are conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately 61 and 59 of our net sales for cvi for the years ended october 31 2007 and 2006 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states further we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

  

acquisitions that we may make may involve numerous risks 

  

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years as part of our growth strategy particularly at csi we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective our failure to develop such improvements to our manufacturing processes could significantly impact our ability to compete 

  

cvi manufactures molded contact lenses which represent a significant portion of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico and norfolk virginia csi manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

  

cvi distributes products out of rochester new york and the united kingdom and various smaller international distribution facilities csi’s products are primarily distributed out of its facility in trumbull connecticut any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted and our product sales and profitability could suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fda’s qsr regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage importing exporting and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures recalls or import holds of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used by us are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products comfilcon a if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi a disruption in the supply of comfilcon a could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this important segment of the contact lens market 

  

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property our business could suffer 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation our claims even if meritorious may be found invalid or inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights in addition litigation can 

  

   

   

   

   

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further we cannot assure you that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

  

we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements which generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property however we cannot assure you that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information furthermore enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies we could lose competitive advantage and be materially adversely affected 

  

we rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for our products to maintain the value of our trademarks we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks also we might not obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks might result in significant litigation costs and damages including the inability to continue using certain trademarks 

  

the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our intellectual property could be subject to claims of infringement 

  

our competitors in both the united states and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products claims that our products infringe the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales incorporating our technology 

  

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry third parties have made and it is possible that they will make in future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology see part i item 3 legal proceedings bausch  lomb ciba vision any claims even those without merit could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

however we cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation any royalty or licensing agreement if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of some of our products and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

  

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

  

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing product might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand in addition consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing product in the future 

  

concerns with the safety of certain contact lens solutions resulting in the voluntary recall of such products may adversely affect the contact lens industry in general 

  

on may 15 2006 bausch  lomb announced a worldwide voluntary recall of renu™ with moistureloc™ following a governmental investigation into an increase in fungal infections among contact lens wearers in the united states and certain asian markets on may 25 2007 advanced medical optics announced a worldwide voluntary recall of complete ® moistureplus™ based on cdc data linking the product to an increased risk of acanthamoeba keratitis a rare but serious infection of the cornea while our contact lens products have not been associated with either of these recalls these recalls and others or similar safety issues may result in more rigorous government oversight regulation or enforcement damage consumer confidence in the safety of contact lens usage which may negatively impact the growth of the contact lens market in general or cause consumers to try alternative vision correcting technologies an overall slowdown in the growth of the worldwide contact lens market could adversely affect our ability to continue to increase revenues thereby having a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we face risks in connection with securities litigation 

  

the company and several of its directors and officers have been named in a consolidated putative securities class action lawsuit and its directors and certain of its officers have been named in two consolidated derivative lawsuits the nature and status of which are described in item 3 legal proceedings the consolidated putative securities class action seeks unspecified damages from the company and we are unable to estimate the range of potential losses that would be incurred if the plaintiffs in this action were to prevail or to determine the total effect that it may have on our results of operations financial position and cash flows however any settlement or judgment on the merits of this action could have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity results of operations and financial condition in addition securities litigation irrespective of its merits is costly to defend and diverts management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

  

the purported derivative lawsuits which are at a very preliminary stage do not seek damages from the company however derivative litigation is costly and these lawsuits may divert management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 

  

we face risks related to environmental matters 

  

our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the enforcement thereof or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition such laws and requirements are constantly changing are different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

  

we are conducting a voluntary cleanup at one of our sites in the state of new york although the workplan that we submitted to the state has been approved and we believe that the cleanup is proceeding in accordance with the workplan and our expectations there can be no assurance that the cleanup will be completed within the timeframe and cost projected that the expected results will be achieved or that we will not identify alternate sources or higher levels of contamination as such there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection therewith 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness 

  

our substantial indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our credit facility and senior notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

  

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we currently use and may continue to use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to effectively manage our risks which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results 

  

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and euro we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions do 

  

not eliminate that risk entirely these hedges also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations finally because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

  

we may be required to recognize impairment charges on goodwill which would reduce our net income consolidated net worth and stockholders’ equity 

  

pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings in a period of such change in addition such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders’ equity and increase our debt to total capitalization ratio which may result in a default under our credit facilities 

  

the accounting for convertible debt securities is subject to uncertainty and changes in accounting guidance could adversely impact our reported and future results 

  

the accounting for convertible debt securities is subject to frequent scrutiny by accounting regulatory bodies and is subject to change we cannot predict if or when any future accounting changes will be made however any such change could have an adverse impact on our reported or future financial results and could adversely affect the trading prices of our securities 

  

for example the accounting method for convertible debt securities that can be settled in stock cash or a combination which would include our 2625 convertible senior debentures due 2023 or our debentures has been under review by accounting regulatory bodies for some time 

  

a proposal to change the existing accounting method for convertible debt securities has recently been made by the fasb under the proposal for accounting purposes convertible debt securities such as our debentures would be bifurcated into a debt component and an equity component the value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value as of the issuance date of a similar nonconvertible debt security the difference between the proceeds from the convertible debt security and the amount reflected as a debt liability would be recorded as additional paidin capital as a result the liability associated with a convertible debt security would be expected to be recorded at a discount to its face amount because the stated interest rate on a convertible debt security is typically lower than the market interest rate that would apply to a similar nonconvertible debt security such convertible debt securities would subsequently accrete to their face amount over their expected life based on the market rate of interest for a similar nonconvertible debt security the proposal would also require issuers to recognize additional noncash interest expense in their income statement based on the difference between the stated interest rate on their convertible debt securities and the market rate of interest for a similar nonconvertible debt security the proposal would apply retrospectively to all periods presented in quarterly and annual filings with the securities and exchange commission this proposed change in accounting methodology if adopted in its current form would negatively affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share for many issuers of convertible debt securities and related interest and debt based financial ratios 

  

implementation of this proposal is ongoing and we cannot predict the exact methodology that will be imposed which may differ materially from the foregoing description or when any change will be finally implemented 

  

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws in addition the internal revenue service irs has been auditing ocular’s income tax returns for the years 2002 – 2005 and we are also subject to the examination of the company’s income tax returns by other tax authorities the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

failure to utilize us net operating losses could negatively impact our statement of operations 

  

at october 31 2007 we had us net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately 1097 million approximately 259 million of the nols expire in fiscal 2008 although we presently anticipate utilizing the entire nol in our tax filings significant and unanticipated changes in our projected us taxable income may result in our not fully utilizing the nol should this occur the tax effect of the unutilized nol would be reflected as a noncashrelated tax provision on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

we are in the process of upgrading certain of our management information systems and we cannot assure you that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruption of our business 

  

we have implemented a management information system at our major locations and are in the process of implementing the system for substantially all of our businesses worldwide many other companies have had severe problems with computer system implementations of this nature and scope we are using a controlled project plan and we believe we have assigned adequate staffing and other resources to the projects to ensure its successful implementation however we cannot assure you that the design will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as designed we are heavily dependent on such computer systems and any failure or delay in the system implementation would cause a substantial interruption to our business additional expense and loss of sales customers and profits 

  

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing and engineering personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

  

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

  

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we will also be afforded the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of october 29 2007 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquiror to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of the our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

  

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

  

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

  

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s design development testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

  

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations in addition the fda may change its policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products 

  

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance 

  

or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position we also cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

development and marketing of our products is subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse affect on our business 

  

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations due to the movement towards harmonization of standards in the european union we expect a changing regulatory environment in europe characterized by a shift from a country bycountry regulatory system to a european unionwide single regulatory system we cannot currently predict the timing of this harmonization our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fda’s qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing or labeling errors or design defects any voluntary or government mandated recall may divert management attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers any recall involving one of our products could also harm the reputation of the product and the company and would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 

  

changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry as well as thirdparty payors’ efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the federal and state governments these proposals could effect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level among the proposals under consideration are price controls on hospitals insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses requirements that companies that sell products to hospitals and other healthcare providers must publicly disclose their prices requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of a government health insurance plan or plans that would cover all citizens 

  

there also continue to be efforts at the federal level to introduce various insurance market reforms expanded fraud and abuse and anti referral legislation and further reductions in medicare and medicaid coverage and reimbursement a broad range of both similar and more comprehensive healthcare reform initiatives is likely to be considered at the state level although it is uncertain which if any of these or other proposals will be adopted the potential for adoption of these proposals affects or may affect our ability to market our products 

  

any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a statebystate basis could require us to develop statespecific marketing and sales approaches in addition we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

  

in addition thirdparty payors whether governmental or commercial whether inside the united states or abroad increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare these costcontrol methods include prospective payment systems capitated rates group purchasing redesign of benefits requiring preauthorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare although cost controls or other requirements imposed by thirdparty payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

furthermore widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain medical products including the voluntary recalls of certain contact lens solutions in 2006 and 2007 by bausch  lomb and advanced medical optics respectively may cause regulatory authorities members of congress the government accounting office medical professionals and the general public to raise concerns about potential medical product safety issues this increased attention may result in increased regulation and scrutiny of medical devices such as for example the food and drug administration amendment act of 2007 which was recently enacted providing for the establishment of a unique system for identifying medical devices among other provisions 

  

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices hhs has released three rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the first rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the second rule released by hhs imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information these standards not only require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information but they also require an entity subject to hipaa to obtain satisfactory assurances that any of its business associates to whom such information is disclosed will safeguard the information the third rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information while we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under hipaa many of our customers are covered entities subject to hipaa such customers may require us to enter into business associate agreements which obligate us to safeguard certain health information we obtain in the course of servicing the customers restrict the manner in which we use and disclose such information and impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and results of operations 

  

federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business results of operations 

  

we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws they may be subject to sanctions which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if there is a change in law regulation administrative or judicial interpretation we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

results of operations 

  

we discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 we began recording sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective transition method whereby prior periods are not restated and do not include such expense we acquired ocular on january 6 2005 and include ocular in our results from that date certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “capital resources and liquidity” 

  

outlook 

  

we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical pc technology™ and specialty contact lenses in the us market demographics are favorable as the teenage population the age when most contact lens wear begins is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades the reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide cvi expects greater market penetration in europe and asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses 

  

we are in the process of developing and launching a number of new contact lens products that we believe will result in cvi continuing to have a broad and competitive product line new products planned for introduction over the next two years include lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials and new lens designs including multifocal lenses contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials have grown significantly and this material is a major product material in the industry the company has launched biofinity ®  a silicone hydrogel contact lens product with sales in europe the united states and australia while initial customer reaction from biofinity ® has been favorable our future growth may be limited by several critical factors relating to silicone hydrogel materials we face normal challenges associated with manufacturing a new material on a new manufacturing platform and are incurring additional manufacturing costs as we attempt to ramp up production volumes and improve efficiencies we believe that our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products will be an important factor affecting future levels of sales growth and profitability 

  

during fiscal 2007 we were engaged in litigation with regard to our silicone hydrogel product and certain lens design patents in november 2007 we reached a global settlement agreement with ciba vision the eye care unit of novartis ag that resolves all disputes with respect to current patent infringement litigation between the companies under the terms of the settlement the companies have agreed to cross license rights to these patents and cvi agreed to pay a royalty on its future net us contact lens sales of biofinity ® until 2014 and on net sales outside of the united states until 2016 

  

our operating results reflect the progression through our integration plan that is designed to optimize operational synergies of our acquisition of ocular integration activities began in january 2005 and are 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

expected to continue through mid calendar year 2008 and include integrating duplicate facilities and expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices our geographic mix of income changed during 2007 and certain expenses associated with the integration plan impacted jurisdictions with lower tax rates as a result our effective tax rate has increased correspondingly 

  

csi has built an extensive product portfolio through acquisition and internal development and we anticipate that csi will continue to consolidate the women’s healthcare market csi expects to benefit from favorable demographic trends as the women of the “babyboomer” generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures that utilize csi products are performed most frequently 

  

in november 2006 csi expanded its hospital market presence by acquiring lone star a manufacturer of medical devices that improve the management of the surgical site and are used in a wide variety of surgical procedures the acquisition of lone star complements csi’s expansion into surgical products that began in november 2005 with the acquisition of neosurg technologies inc neosurg a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery and inlet medical inc inlet a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits 

  

regarding capital resources we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of 32 million plus cash from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends and smaller acquisitions we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 of approximately 160 – 180 million primarily to expand silicone hydrogel and singleuse lens manufacturing capacity complete the consolidation of distribution centers and for information technology

net sales growth includes increases in singleuse spheres up 29 at 1137 million all disposable spheres up 10 and total spheres up 8 biofinity ®  cvi’s silicone hydrogel spherical lens had sales of 98 million primarily in europe and the united states disposable toric sales grew 13 with total toric sales up 8 and disposable multifocal sales up 25 cvi’s line of specialty lenses grew 10 cosmetic lenses grew 5 and older conventional lens products declined 13 proclear ® products continued global market share gains as proclear ® toric sales increased 47 to 519 million proclear ® spheres including biomedics xc™ and proclear ® 1 day increased 22 to 1025 million and proclear ® multifocal lenses including biomedics xc™ increased 52 to 318 million 

  

cvi’s sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement while unit growth and product mix have influenced cvi’s sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth 

  

csi net sales 

  

csi’s net sales increased 24 to 1548 million with organic sales growth of about 9 sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 51 and now represent 27 of csi’s sales women’s healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate more than 94 of csi’s sales the balance are sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare which csi does not actively market csi’s acquisitions during the year did not significantly affect cooper’s consolidated results of operations while unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth

cost of salesgross profit 

  

   

cvi’s margin was 54 in fiscal 2007 compared with 62 in fiscal 2006 as a result of the cost of integration activities and manufacturing inefficiencies related to new products and changing product mix that impacted cost of sales the changing product mix included a shift to lower margin sphere products including singleuse spheres that represented 14 of lens sales in fiscal 2007 compared to 12 in fiscal 2006 cvi’s fiscal 2007 cost of sales includes sharebased compensation expense production startup costs for our new silicone hydrogel products and the write off of manufacturing assets associated with ocular integration activities these costs amounted to 714 million or 9 of sales in the period for 2006 cost of sales included sharebased compensation expense integration costs production start up costs for our new silicone hydrogel products and profits and losses associated with product lines being phased out which were about 2 of sales in the period manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ramp up of new products and plant realignment activities are expected to significantly decline in 2008 

  

csi’s margin improved to 59 in fiscal 2007 compared with 58 in fiscal 2006 gross margin reflects continuing efficiencies associated with recent acquisitions

consolidated sga increased by 14 in 2007 20 in 2006 and 56 in 2005 as a percentage of net sales consolidated sga increased to 43 in fiscal 2007 from 42 in 2006 and 37 in 2005 the increase in sga is primarily due to costs supporting increased sales levels as well as integration costs including the rationalization of distribution centers lenses used in marketing programs and litigation costs 

  

cvi’s sga increased 13 in 2007 primarily due to costs related to the rationalization of distribution centers lenses used in marketing programs and intellectual property litigation and 17 in 2006 primarily due to sharebased compensation expenses integration costs and intellectual property litigation costs sga as a percentage of net sales increased to 40 in 2007 from 39 in 2006 and 35 in 2005

csi’s 2007 sga increased 22 over 2006 which supported the 24 increase in sales and 2006 sga increased 18 over 2005 selling and marketing costs increased to support organic sales growth and integration costs contributed to the increase partially offset by a 32 million gain on the sale of a cardiovascular cryosurgery product line not related to women’s healthcare 

  

corporate headquarters’ sga which increased 9 to 315 million in 2007 and 64 to 288 million in 2006 were 3 of consolidated net sales in both periods the growth in 2007 was primarily due to sharebased compensation expense the growth in 2006 was primarily due to sharebased compensation and securities litigation expense the growth since 2005 includes added costs due to the ocular acquisition continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the company’s global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements 

  

research and development expense 

  

research and development rd expense grew 15 over 2006 and was 4 of sales in both periods and 5 of sales in 2005 399 million in 2007 345 million in 2006 and 429 million in 2005 rd expense included acquired inprocess research and development of 72 million in 2007 and 75 million in 2006 for csi and 200 million in 2005 for cvi 

  

cvi’s research and development expenditures were 276 million up 17 in 2007 and 235 million in 2006 up 19 net of acquired inprocess rd in 2005 cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing pc technology™ 

  

csi’s research and development expenditures were 51 million up 45 in 2007 and 35 million up 13 over 2005 net of acquired inprocess rd csi’s research and development activities were for newly acquired laparoscopic surgical devices and the upgrade and redesign of many csi osteoporosis invitro fertilization incontinence and assisted reproductive technology products and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities 

  

restructuring expense 

  

restructuring expenses were 97 million in 2007 including 92 million related to the integration of ocular and 05 million related to csi integration activities 64 million in 2006 including expenses of cvi related to the integration of ocular and the phase out of corneal health product lines and 85 million in 2005 resulting from the integration of ocular with cvi and csi integration activities 

  

in connection with the january 6 2005 acquisition of ocular cvi has progressed through our integration plan optimizing operational synergies of the combined companies as of october 31 2007 we have recorded 472 million for integration activities that included integrating duplicate facilities and expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices 

  

we estimate that the total restructuring costs under this integration plan will be approximately 50 million of which approximately 25 – 30 million are cash related and will be reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of operations see note 3 acquisition and restructuring costs

amortization of intangibles 

  

amortization of intangibles was 162 million in 2007 143 million in 2006 and 117 million in 2005 amortization expense increased in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 primarily due to acquired intangible assets including the addition of 130 million of other intangible assets from ocular in fiscal 2005 

  

operating income 

  

operating income declined 899 million or 66 between 2005 and 2007 

  

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense increased 14 to 427 million in 2007 26 to 373 million in 2006 and 395 to 297 million in 2005 the increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average debt balances to support capital investments and acquisitions including the acquisition of ocular in fiscal 2005 we had 7170 million in loans on our credit facility on october 31 2007 compared to 6053 million outstanding on october 31 2006 

  

on january 31 2007 cooper refinanced its existing 750 million syndicated bank credit facility which consisted of a 250 million term loan and a 500 million revolving credit facility with a new 650 million syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit revolver and 350 million aggregate principal amount 7125 senior notes the refinancing extended the maturity and provided additional borrowing flexibility along with lower overall pricing relative to the prior agreement in addition the company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolver by up to an additional 250 million keybank led the revolver refinancing which resulted in a number of the banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement the revolver matures on january 31 2012 

  

interest rates for the revolver are based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus additional basis points determined by certain ratios of debt to pro forma earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined in the credit agreement these range from 75 to 150 basis points as of october 31 2007 the additional basis points were 125

other expense income net 

  

   

in fiscal 2007 we recognized a net loss of about 30 million primarily related to the british pound and euro strengthening against the us dollar 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

we recorded tax expense of 119 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to 71 million for fiscal year 2006 our geographic mix of income changed during 2007 and certain expenses associated with the ocular integration plan have impacted jurisdictions with lower tax rates resulting in net operating losses in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and net operating income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates 

  

sharebased compensation plans 

  

effective november 1 2005 the company began recording compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised sharebased payment sfas 123r prior to november 1 2005 the company accounted for stock options according to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and related interpretations and therefore no related compensation expense was recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value the company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided for under sfas 123r and consequently has not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods under this transition method compensation cost associated with stock options recognized in fiscal 2006 includes 1 amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to november 1 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas 123 and 2 amortization related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to november 1 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r

the compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements for stock options and restricted stock awards were as follows 

  

   

cash received from options exercised under all sharebased payment arrangements for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 was 93 million and 30 million respectively 

  

the company continues to estimate the fair value of each sharebased award on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes previously under sfas 123 the company did not utilize separate employee groupings in the determination of option values the company now estimates option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically the adjustment of the forfeiture rate resulted in a 19 million reduction in sharebased compensation expense in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2007

operating cash flows 

  

cash flow provided from operating activities continued as cooper’s major source of liquidity totaling 1340 million in fiscal 2007 and 1505 million in 2006 operating cash flow decreased as we have utilized cash to build inventory in support of new product launches for costs associated with our ocular integration plan and for the reduction of accounts payable 

  

working capital increased 507 million in fiscal 2007 due to increases of 179 million in receivables 314 million in inventory 125 million in prepaid and other current assets 37 million in deferred tax assets and decreases of 149 million in shortterm debt and 47 million in accounts payable this activity was partially offset as cash decreased 50 million and accrued liabilities increased 294 million the significant increase in working capital is primarily due to the refinancing of cooper’s credit facility which reduced the current portion of debt along with building inventory in support of new product launches distribution center consolidations and increasing sales levels in addition csi’s acquisitions of lone star and wallach increased net working capital and were funded with longterm debt 

  

at the end of fiscal 2007 cooper’s inventory months on hand moh were 59 compared to 80 at fiscal yearend 2006 however our adjusted moh is 74 net of 273 million of charges to costs of sales recorded in our fiscal fourth quarter 2007 associated with our ocular integration plan as we continue to build inventory in support of new product launches and distribution center consolidations also our days sales outstanding dso decreased to 60 days from 63 days at october 31 2006 based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 

  

investing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 2646 million from investing activities was driven by payments of 810 million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of 1836 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity consolidate distribution centers and continue the rollout of new information systems 

  

financing cash flows 

  

the cash inflow of 1251 million from financing activities was driven by net proceeds from longterm debt of 1108 million net proceeds from shortterm debt of 208 million and 93 million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by payment of debt acquisition costs of 133 million and dividends on our common stock of 27 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2007

risk management 

  

most of our operations outside the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally our pound sterling euro canadian dollar and japanese yen denominated debt and receivables and from operations in foreign currencies we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on our revolver under our new credit facility varies with the london interbank offered rate our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging approximately 275 million of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for periods of 23 months to 48 months see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

  

on january 31 2007 cooper refinanced its existing 750 million syndicated bank credit facility which consisted of a 250 million term loan and a 500 million revolving credit facility with a new 650 million syndicated senior unsecured revolving line of credit revolver and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 7125 of senior notes the refinancing extended the maturity and provided additional borrowing flexibility along with lower overall pricing relative to prior agreement in addition the company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolver by up to an additional 250 million keybank led the revolver refinancing which resulted in a number of the banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement the revolver matures on january 31 2012 see note 7 debt 

  

outlook

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 in sab 108 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company’s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures sab 108 permits public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements or ii recording the cumulative effect as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings the company implemented sab 108 during fiscal 2007 and it did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the company is currently evaluating the impact sfas 157 which is effective for the company beginning in our fiscal year ending october 31 2009 will have on its consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2007 the company adopted sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income prior to the adoption of sfas 158 the company accounted for its defined benefit postretirement plan under sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas 87 sfas 87 required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets the adjustment to initially apply sfas 158 was approximately 15 million net of tax benefit of about 10 million and was recorded as a noncash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity under sfas 87 changes in the funded status were disclosed but not immediately recognized rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods in addition sfas 158 requires that the postretirement plan assets and obligations be measured as of the end of our fiscal year we plan to adopt the measurement provisions of sfas 158 in our fiscal year ending october 31 2009 and are currently evaluating the impact of this provision of sfas 158 on our consolidated financial statements see note 11 employee benefits

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 sfas 159 sfas 159 provides the option to measure at fair value eligible financial instrument items which are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value the irrevocable decision to measure items at fair value is made at specified election dates on an instrumentbyinstrument basis changes in that instrument’s fair value must be recognized in current earnings in subsequent reporting periods if elected the first measurement to fair value is reported as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earning in the year of adoption sfas 159 also establishes additional disclosure requirements the company is currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of sfas 159 if we elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value this statement is effective for the company beginning in our fiscal year ending october 31 2009 

  

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48  fin 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to statement sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes sfas 109 under fin 48 a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position fin 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax position that are recognized provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits fin 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 for the company fin 48 will be effective for our fiscal year ending october 31 2008 differences between the amounts recognized prior to and after the adoption of fin 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 

  

based on a preliminary analysis management believes that adoption of fin 48 will result in recording an increase to retained earnings of between 5 million and 6 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2008 however the final analysis will be completed in the fiscal first quarter of 2008 

  

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

our reporting units are the same as our business segments – cvi and csi – reflecting the way that we manage our business we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist we performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2007 and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill 

  

   

   

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact if any of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction a valuation allowance is established tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates to determine the quarterly tax rate we are required to estimate fullyear income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction we update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can affect the overall effective tax rate and such changes could be material 

  

   

under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating cooper’s stock price volatility employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

the expected life of the sharebased awards is based on the observed and expected time to postvesting forfeiture andor exercise groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publiclytraded options on the company’s stock at the date of grant historical implied volatility of the company’s publiclytraded options historical volatility and other factors the riskfree interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the us treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by the stock price at the date of grant 

  

as sharebased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 

  

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas 123r the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period in 2005 prior to the adoption of sfas 123r the company valued its sharebased compensation using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25  and related interpretations

as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2007 it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time we entered into interest rate swaps designed to fix the borrowing costs related to 525 million of the company’s syndicated bank credit facility and subsequently reduced the notional amount of interest rate swaps to 275 million as of october 31 2007 if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by approximately 900 thousand annually

the company’s management with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2007 based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control – integrated framework  management under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october 31 2007 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2007 as stated in their report beginning on page 62 of this form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

as of october 31 2007 there had been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting 

  

it should be noted that because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements errors or fraud also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1  business  

  

the cooper companies inc cooper or the company a delaware corporation organized in 1980 develops manufactures and markets healthcare products primarily medical devices through its two business units coopervision cvi and coopersurgical csi 

  

cvi develops manufactures and markets a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market its leading products are disposable spherical and specialty contact lenses 

  

cvi is a leading manufacturer of toric lenses which correct astigmatism multifocal lenses for presbyopia blurring near vision due to advancing age cosmetic lenses that change or enhance the appearance of the color of the eye and spherical lenses that correct the most common visual defects cvi’s products are primarily manufactured at its facilities located in the united kingdom puerto rico and norfolk virginia cvi distributes product out of rochester new york south san francisco california the united kingdom and various smaller distribution facilities 

  

csi develops manufactures and markets medical devices diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians 

  

cvi and csi each operate in a highly competitive environment competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

we estimate that the worldwide soft contact lens market grew about 10 percent during 2005 to about 46 billion annually in the united states about 38 percent of the worldwide market revenue grew about 8 percent to 17 billion while revenue in countries outside the united states grew 12 percent to 29 billion 

  

japan and the pacific rim countries about 15 billion or 32 percent of the world market grew about 16 percent europe about 14 billion or 30 percent of the market grew about 8 percent 

  

in many markets favorable demographics an increase in the reported incidence of myopia a slowing of contact lens wearers drop out rates and a continuing shift in practitioner preferences from lowfeatured “commodity” lenses to highervalue specialty lenses support a favorable world market outlook 

  

in 2005 cooper acquired ocular sciences inc ocular giving it access to new technologies particularly patented silicone hydrogel and singleuse lens technologies new geographic markets particularly japan and germany and higher volume manufacturing processes particularly the gen ii platform 

  

historically cvi has shown strength in the specialty segments of the contact lens market which include toric lenses which correct astigmatism cosmetic lenses which change or enhance the appearance of the color of the eye longterm extended wear lenses and multifocal lenses for presbyopia cvi estimates that specialty lenses currently account for about 53 percent or 24 billion of the worldwide contact lens market 

  

with the ocular acquisition cvi has gained a significant presence in the largest segment of the contact lens market lenses that correct the most common types of visual defects – near and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects these lenses account for about 47 percent of the world market for contact lenses 

  

cvi’s 2005 revenue growth 

  

cvi’s revenue in the united states grew 58 percent and 99 percent in markets outside the us we estimate that cvi now holds about 20 percent of the united states market and about 17 percent of the worldwide market the inclusion of ocular net sales since the acquisition date of january 6 2005 is the primary reason for cvi’s growth in fiscal 2005 

  

specialty contact lens revenue 

  

worldwide cvi’s specialty lens revenue grew 46 percent in 2005 sales of cvi’s toric lenses its most extensive product line grew 51 percent and now account for about 33 percent of its total lens revenue we estimate that the worldwide toric market grew about 16 percent during this period cvi’s pc technology products – its line of spherical toric and multifocal products that incorporate phosphorylcholine technology – grew 39 percent 

  

spherical contact lens revenue 

  

we estimate that the market for spherical contact lenses grew 8 percent worldwide during 2005 driven in part by the acceptance of newer silicone hydrogel lenses that offer high levels of oxygen to the cornea in fiscal 2005 cvi did not have silicone hydrogel products in its product line and had acquired high levels of trade inventories of spherical products with the ocular acquisition consequently when ocular’s spherical sales during the periods in 2005 when cvi did not own them are included in the comparison cvi’s spherical lens revenue declined three percent cvi’s reported spherical revenue grew 106 percent including 724 million of singleuse lenses acquired with ocular 

  

cvi introduced its biofinity ™ brand of silicone hydrogel spherical contact lenses in december 2005 and continues to compete against silicone with additional pc technology and singleuse products 

  

cvi sales growth by geographic segment 

  

in 2005 cvi’s sales in the united states grew 58 percent and represent 42 percent of its worldwide sales in markets outside the united states sales grew 99 percent these markets now represent about 58 percent of cvi’s lens sales 

  

europe 

  

cvi’s european revenue grew about 67 percent over 2004 with strength in sales of toric lenses which grew 64 percent cvi estimates that it is the second largest contact lens supplier in europe with business units in france germany holland hungary italy norway portugal spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom 

  

far east 

  

cvi’s revenue in japan and the pacific rim grew about 386 percent over 2004 japan is the second largest contact lens market in the world after the united states and soft lens popularity continues to grow cvi estimates that the total market for soft contact lenses in japan and the pacific rim today is about 15 billion compared to about 17 billion in the united states the japanese market growing about 16 percent per year is largely made up of singleuse and twoweek disposable lenses which represent about 95 percent of the market 

  

the incidence of nearsightedness in japan is one of the highest in the world about 80 percent of the nearsighted population has some degree of astigmatism significantly greater than the 50 percent incidence reported in the united states about half of those with astigmatism are potential candidates for toric lenses the japanese toric segment currently a smaller percentage of the total market than it is in the united states is expected to grow rapidly as newer generations of toric lenses are introduced 

  

cvi competition 

  

a number of manufacturers compete in the worldwide market for contact lenses which was approximately 46 billion in 2005 cvi’s three largest competitors are johnson  johnson’s vistakon division ciba vision owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

the contact lens market has two major segments the spherical lens segment about 22 billion in 2005 is comprised of lenses that correct uncomplicated near and farsightedness the larger specialty lens segment about 24 billion in 2005 is comprised of lenses that address special needs of contact lens patients and includes toric cosmetic multifocal and premium lenses cvi offers both specialty lenses and spherical lenses 

  

to compete successfully in the contact lens market companies must market differentiated products priced competitively and therefore manufactured efficiently for numerous market niches cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips a costeffective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility means that cvi can 

  

   

   

in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through its use of the lens edge technology provided under the patents covered by its edge patent license described under “patents trademarks and licensing agreements” 

  

to enhance its competitiveness in the worldwide lens market cooper acquired ocular in 2005 the ocular acquisition gave cvi access to new technologies particularly patented silicone hydrogel and singleuse lens technologies new geographic markets particularly japan and germany and higher volume manufacturing processes such as the gen ii manufacturing platform 

  

cooper’s proclear ® line of spherical multifocal and toric lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates a proprietary phosphorylcholine technology that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility the proclear ® line of lenses are the only lenses with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

the contact lens market is highly competitive cvi’s primary toric competitors are bausch  lomb incorporated and johnson  johnson’s vistakon division lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens 

  

parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners cvi believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors providing greater choices for patient and practitioner and better visual acuity and that it offers superior customer services including high standards of ontime product delivery 

  

cvi’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces nevertheless cvi offers a high level of customer service through its several direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the company’s lens products cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well equipped through extensive training to meet the needs of contact lens practitioners and their customers 

  

cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects cvi believes that it will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share cvi also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales of contact lenses because each modality serves a different age group almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties while refractive surgery patients are typically in their late thirties or early forties when their vision has stabilized 

  

coopersurgical 

  

historically many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system csi’s strategy is to identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas particularly opportunities in aging and infertility in november 2005 csi acquired two companies in the gynecological surgery market to advance csi’s expansion within the rapidly developing hospital segment of women’s healthcare see “profiles of recent acquisitions” below 

  

since its inception in 1990 csi has successfully established a leading position among companies providing medical device products to the obstetrics and gynecology medical specialty especially within the physician office segment of women’s healthcare since then csi has grown to over 100 million in revenue through a series of more than 20 acquisitions during the past five years csi’s revenue grew at a compounded rate of 19 percent with operating margins in the upper teens excluding restructuring costs and has generated more than 766 million in free cash flow cooper’s strong cash flow allows csi to readily compete for these opportunities and csi is now a leader in women’s healthcare 

  

market for women’s healthcare 

  

medical economists expect patient visits to obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns to increase by 13 percent over the next decade driving this growth is a large group of women of childbearing age and a rapidly growing middleaged population with emerging gynecologic concerns consistent with an aging population menopausal problems – abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis – will increase while pregnancy contraceptive management and general examinations are expected to remain stable the trend toward delaying the age of childbearing to the midthirties and beyond will likely drive increasing treatment for infertility 

  

women between the ages of 18 and 44 generate the highest number of office visits and hospital admissions while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care about onethird of all office visits for this age group are to the obgyn who are therefore the primary market target for associated medical devices there are nearly 30000 obgyn’s under the age of 65 practicing at nearly 13700 locations in the united states and women account for nearly 60 percent of all inpatient hospital stays 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

csi’s 2005 revenue growth 

  

during 2005 csi revenue grew 7 percent to 1087 million representing 13 percent of cooper’s revenue its operating margin reached 16 percent for the fiscal year below last year’s 21 percent as the company elected to invest in expanding its sales force to stimulate organic revenue growth rates and shut down a manufacturing location in europe 

  

csi competition 

  

csi focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances csi offers all of the products needed for a complete procedure the market segments in which csi competes continue to be fragmented typified by smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi believes that it competes successfully against these companies with its superior sales and marketing the technological advantages of its products and by developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures as csi expands its product line it also offers to train medical professionals in their appropriate use 

  

during 2004 csi implemented an initiative to expand its sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years these programs focus on csi’s products in the incontinence infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of independent and direct sales representatives 

  

profiles of recent acquisitions 

  

ocular sciences inc 

  

on january 6 2005 cooper acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ocular a global manufacturer and marketer of soft contact lenses primarily spherical and daily disposable contact lenses that are brand and product differentiated by distribution channel the aggregate consideration paid for the stock of ocular was about 12 billion plus transaction costs less acquired cash cooper paid approximately 600 million in cash and issued approximately 107 million shares of its common stock to ocular stockholders and option holders under the terms of the acquisition each share of ocular common stock was converted into the right to receive 03879 of a share of cooper common stock and 2200 in cash without interest plus cash for fractional shares outstanding ocular stock options were redeemed in exchange for a combination of cash and cooper stock for the spread between their exercise prices and the value of the merger consideration immediately prior to closing 

  

acquisitions in the gynecological surgery market during 2005 

  

in november 2005 csi acquired neosurg technologies inc a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery and inlet medical inc a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits these purchases advance csi’s expansion within the rapidly developing hospital segment of women’s healthcare cooper paid about 50 million for the two companies csi plans to develop a separate surgical sales force beginning in 2006 and expects additional selling and interest costs attributed to these transactions 

  

neosurg has developed a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system to compete in the 285 million market for trocars within the 29 billion market for laparoscopic surgical devices csi believes that the neosurg ® technology will offer surgeons a superior product to existing disposable trocars while giving hospital and surgery centers the opportunity to realize significant cost reduction 

  

inlet offers a costeffective trocar wound closure system and supplies procedure kits for the treatment of pelvic support problems inlet’s carterthomason closesure system ® is recognized as the premiere trocar wound closure device on the market in addition to its trocar wound closure system inlet has been an active surgical procedure kit developer for pelvic floor reconstructive surgical products including the elevest ® kit for the laparoscopy treatment of uterine prolapse the avesta ® kit a minimally invasive technique to restore vaginal support and the metra ® ps kit designed to correct retroverted uterus these procedures give women effective and less invasive treatment options and in some cases an alternative to a hysterectomy 

  

research and development 

  

cooper employs 88 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments outside specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support product development and clinical research for cvi products csi conducts research and development inhouse and also employs outside surgical specialists including members of its surgical advisory board 

  

coopersponsored research and development expenditures during the fiscal years ended october 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 229 million – excluding a writeoff of 20 million of purchased inprocess research and development related to ocular – 65 million and 56 million respectively representing 3 1 and 1 of net sales in each fiscal year during fiscal 2005 cvi spent 86 and csi spent 14 of the total we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs 

  

government regulation 

  

medical device regulation 

  

our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states and other regulatory bodies abroad fda regulations govern among other things medical device design and development testing manufacturing labeling storage recordkeeping premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and sales and distribution unless an exemption applies each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior 510k clearance or prior premarket approval or pma from the fda a majority of the medical devices we currently market have received fda clearance through the 510k process or approval through the pma process because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop or any product enhancements will be subject to the shorter 510k clearance process significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur for example to qualify our new silicone hydrogel contact lens products for extended wear use more extensive premarket testing and approval will be required 

  

device classification 

  

the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes – class i ii or iii – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require substantially lower levels of regulation 

  

class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to fda’s general regulatory controls for medical devices which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda’s quality system regulation facility registration and product listing reporting of adverse medical events and appropriate truthful and nonmisleading labeling advertising and promotional materials general controls some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the 510k premarket notification process described below 

  

class ii devices are subject to the fda’s general controls and any other special controls as deemed necessary by fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the 510k premarket notification procedure 

  

pursuant to the medical device user fee and modernization act of 2002 or mdufma as of october 2002 unless a specific exemption applies 510k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees certain class ii devices are exempt from this premarket review process 

  

class iii devices are those devices which have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below premarket approval applications and supplemental premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under mdufma than are 510k premarket notifications 

  

510k clearance pathway 

  

when we are required to obtain a 510k clearance for a device that we wish to market we must submit a premarket notification to fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may 28 1976 for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications by regulation the fda is required to respond to a 510k premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification as a practical matter clearance can take significantly longer if fda determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a previouslycleared device or use the fda will place the device or the particular use of the device into class iii 

  

after a device receives 510k clearance any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that changes its intended use will require a new 510k clearance or could require premarket approval the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing andor recall the modified device until 510k clearance or premarket approval is obtained also in these circumstances we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we believe do not require new 510k clearances 

  

premarket approval pathway 

  

a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510k premarket notification procedures the pma process is much more demanding than the 510k premarket notification process a pma application must be supported by extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trials manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device 

  

after a pma application is complete the fda begins an indepth review of the submitted information the fda by statute and regulation has 180 days to review an accepted pma application although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years during this review period the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided also during the review period an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device in addition the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the 

  

manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation or qsr new pma applications or pma application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 

  

clinical trials 

  

a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a 510k premarket notification these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption or ide to the fda the ide application must be supported by appropriate data such as animal and laboratory testing results showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and cooper has no product currently being marketed under an ide 

  

continuing fda regulation 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply these include the quality system regulation or qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting or mdr regulations which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur the fda has broad postmarket and regulatory enforcement powers we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations 

  

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda which may include any of the following sanctions fines injunctions and civil penalties recall or seizure of our products operating restrictions suspension of production refusing our request for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products withdrawing 510k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved fda regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use failure to comply with this prohibition on “offlabel” promotion could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

foreign regulation 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 9000 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

other health care regulation 

  

we may be subject to various federal state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws in addition if there is a change in law regulation administrative or judicial interpretation we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful 

  

antikickback and fraud laws 

  

our operations may be subject to federal and state antikickback laws certain provisions of the social security act which are commonly known collectively as the medicare fraud and abuse statute prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid the definition of “remuneration” under this statute has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value including such items as gifts discounts waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the medicare fraud and abuse statute some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source not only by the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa created new prohibitions on healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payers the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially 

  

false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services this statute applies to any health benefit plan not just medicare and medicaid additionally hipaa granted expanded enforcement authority to hhs and the us department of justice and provided enhanced resources to support the activities and responsibilities of the oig and department of justice by authorizing large increases in funding for investigating fraud and abuse violations relating to healthcare delivery and payment in addition hipaa mandates the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information 

  

physician selfreferral laws 

  

we may also be subject to federal and state physician selfreferral laws federal physician selfreferral legislation commonly known as the stark law prohibits subject to certain exceptions physician referrals of medicare and medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral and any person collecting any amounts in connection with an unlawful referral is obligated to refund such amounts various states have corollary laws to the stark law including laws that require physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a healthcare provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider both the scope and exceptions for such laws vary from state to state 

  

false claims laws 

  

under separate statutes submission of claims for payment or causing such claims to be submitted that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federally funded state health programs these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act which prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil penalties of between 5500 and 11000 for each separate false claim suits filed under the false claims act known as “qui tam” actions can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals known as “relators” or more commonly as “whistleblowers” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement in addition certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action pay fines or be excluded from the medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action 

  

raw materials 

  

cvi’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials there are alternative supply sources for all of our raw materials other than our new silicone hydrogel material raw materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice 

  

marketing and distribution 

  

in the united states cvi markets its products through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians optical chains and distributors cvi augments its us sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in professional journals in australia brazil canada france germany holland hungary italy japan korea norway portugal south africa spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom cvi primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives in other countries cvi uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to market its products 

  

csi’s products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales and marketing activities with ecommerce telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business faces significant risks these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks and the trading prices of our common stock or convertible debentures could decline these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

we operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 

  

each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment in our soft contact lens segment cvi faces intense competition from competitors’ products including newer silicone hydrogel contact lenses and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market our major competitors in the contact lens business have substantially greater financial resources larger research and development budgets larger sales forces greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than cvi 

  

our major competitors in the specialty contact lens business offer competitive products newer materials plus a variety of other eyecare products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their lenses moreover newer silicone hydrogel lenses may gain market acceptance in the specialty lens business before we are able to manufacture in volume and market our own competitive silicone hydrogel specialty products which could erode our market share and margins 

  

the market for our nonspecialty commodity contact lenses is also intensely competitive and is characterized by declining prices for many older product lines and growing demand for newer silicone hydrogel based products our ability to respond to these competitive pressures will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce our own silicone hydrogel products on a timely basis and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies for such products any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend in part on our ability to increase sales volume and production capacity our failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to a lesser extent cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future or that a successful entry into cvi’s highermargin specialty lens segments by a larger competitor would not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

in the women’s healthcare segment competitive factors include technological and scientific advances product quality price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals coopersurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche markets some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products 

  

product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate and we face the risk of product obsolescence 

  

product innovations are important in the contact lens business in which cvi competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which csi competes we have not historically allocated substantial resources to new product development but rather have purchased leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others with the acquisition of ocular we have begun to invest more in new product development including the development of silicone hydrogel based contact lenses although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the short to medium term rather than on funding longerterm higher risk research and development projects time commitments the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial there can be no assurance that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and as a result justify the expense involved in their development and regulatory approval in addition our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies that could lead to the obsolescence of one or more of our products failure to stay current with our competitors with regard to new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

if our products are not accepted by the market we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 

  

certain of our proposed products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced and we cannot assure you that any of them will achieve market acceptance or generate operating profits we have not commercially marketed many of our planned new products such as certain of our planned silicone hydrogel contact lens products and new contact lens products containing our patented phosphorilcoline pc technology and have just begun manufacturing silicone hydrogel lenses in europe market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain the development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors some of which are out of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

new medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our optical products 

  

technological developments in the eyecare and women’s healthcare industries such as new surgical procedures or medical devices may limit demand for our products corneal refractive surgical procedures such as lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease the demand for our optical products if these new advances were to provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease we cannot assure that medical advances and technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses 

  

our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

  

a significant portion of our current operations is conducted and located outside the united states and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions we have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in north america and europe approximately 49 and 42 of our net sales for fiscal years ended october 31 2005 and 2004 respectively were derived from the sale of products outside the united states further we believe that sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future international operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in large part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations however any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and consequently our operating results 

  

acquisitions we may make may involve numerous risks 

  

we have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have significantly contributed to our growth in recent years including our recent acquisition of ocular as part of our growth strategy particularly at csi we intend to continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies products and businesses future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities 

  

the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization andor writeoffs of goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition and results of operations risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disaster use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective our failure to develop such new manufacturing processes could significantly impact our ability to compete 

  

cvi manufactures our molded contact lenses which represent a significant portion of our contact lens revenues primarily at our facilities in the united kingdom puerto rico and norfolk virginia csi manufactures the majority of its products in trumbull connecticut we manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site before we can use a second manufacturing site we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities and because this process is expensive we have generally not sought approvals needed to manufacture at an additional site if there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product which could result in lost customers and thereby reduce sales profitability and market share 

  

if our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted and our product sales and profitability could suffer 

  

our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with numerous federal state and foreign regulatory requirements including the fda’s quality system regulation or qsr regulations 

  

in japan and other similar foreign regulations which govern the procedures related to the design testing production processes controls quality assurance labeling packaging storage and shipping of our products we also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries failure to pass a qsr or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to among other things significant fines suspension of approvals seizures or recalls of products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions as a result any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice 

  

we rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials raw materials used by us are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice asahikasei aime co ltd asahi is our sole supplier of the material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products comfilcon a if asahi fails to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products and may need to switch to an alternative supplier in accordance with our agreement with asahi a disruption in the supply of comfilcon a could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in all segments of the contact lens market 

  

we face risks related to environmental matters 

  

our facilities are subject to a broad range of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and requirements including those governing discharges to the air and water the handling or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations we have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the discovery of contamination at our facilities may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition as a manufacturer of various products we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such claims 

  

we are involved in a voluntary cleanup at one of our sites in the state of new york and although the workplan submitted to the state was accepted and the cleanup is proceeding in accordance with the workplan and our expectations there can be no assurance that the cleanup will be completed within the timeframe and cost projected that the expected results will be achieved or that we will not identify alternate sources of contamination in connection with their remediation as such there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with any such remediation 

  

we could experience losses from product liability claims including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products 

  

we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury we also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing product might necessitate a product recall and other actions by manufacturers distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand in addition consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall or has been counterfeited we handle some risk with thirdparty carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations there can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls or a decline in sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing product in the future 

  

if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property our business could suffer 

  

we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and licensing agreements to be an integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have applied for patent protection in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for a period of time which may last until patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further we cannot assure you that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents 

  

we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information we require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies we could lose competitive advantages and be materially adversely affected 

  

the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our intellectual property could be subject to claims of infringement 

  

our competitors in both the us and foreign countries many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain patents that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties claims that our products infringe the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales incorporating our technology 

  

significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry third parties have made and it is possible that they will make in future claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology any claims even those without merit could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

any royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all a successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products in any major market could adversely affect our business 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness as of october 31 2005 we had total indebtedness of 7049 million and 1793 million of availability under our bank credit facility for further borrowings 

  

our substantial indebtedness could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition our credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

  

we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of variable and fixedrate debt in order to maintain our desired mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt we may use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variablerate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements without exchange of the underlying principal amounts we may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to effectively manage our risks which could adversely affect our business earnings and financial condition 

  

exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results 

  

as a result of our international operations currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position our most significant currency exposures are the british pound canadian dollar japanese yen and euro we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations these hedging transactions if entered into will not eliminate that risk entirely in addition to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations additionally because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 

  

we may be required to recognize impairment charges on goodwill which would reduce our consolidated net worth and stockholders’ equity 

  

pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings in a period of such change in addition such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareholders’ equity increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio which may result in a default under our credit facilities 

  

increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns for ocular sciences inc for periods prior to our acquisition could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it 

  

has lower statutory rates by changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws in addition the internal revenue service has been auditing ocular’s income tax returns for the years 1999 – 2003 and we are also subject to the examination of its income tax returns by other tax authorities the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

we are in the process of upgrading certain of our management information systems and we cannot assure you that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruption of our business 

  

we have implemented a management information system at our major locations and are in the process of implementing the system for substantially all of our businesses worldwide many other companies have had severe problems with computer system implementations of this nature and scope we are using a controlled project plan and we believe we have assigned adequate staffing and other resources to the projects to ensure its successful implementation however we cannot assure you that the design will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as designed we are heavily dependent on such computer systems and any failure or delay in the system implementation would cause a substantial interruption to our business additional expense and loss of sales customers and profits 

  

if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel our business and our ability to obtain new customers develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate highly skilled sales marketing and engineering personnel competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit train or retain qualified personnel 

  

provisions of our governing documents and delaware law and our rights plan may have antitakeover effects 

  

certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit changes in control of the company not approved by our board of directors these provisions include i advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and ii the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such terms as our board may determine we will also be afforded the protections of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which could have similar effects our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan commonly known as a “poison pill” pursuant to a rights agreement dated as of october 29 1997 the rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquiror to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors however it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our company even if a majority of the our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 

  

risks relating to government regulation of manufacture and sale of our products 

  

our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or operations could adversely affect our business 

  

our products and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities in the united states the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s testing manufacture safety labeling storage recordkeeping reporting marketing promotion and distribution as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the united states to foreign markets our failure to comply with fda regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions including injunctions suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals product recalls termination of distribution or product seizures in the most egregious cases criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 

  

our medical devices require clearance or approval by the fda before they can be commercially distributed in the united states and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device particularly from the fda can be costly and time consuming there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis if at all or that significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations 

  

modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new fda clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use design or manufacture the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance but the fda may review any manufacturer’s decision we have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application but we cannot confirm that the fda will agree with our decisions if the fda requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position 

  

even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted the fda may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted and failure to comply with fda regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or “offlabel” use could result in enforcement action by the fda including among other things warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil or criminal penalties 

  

development and marketing of our products is subject to strict governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies and failure to receive or delay in receiving foreign qualifications could have a material adverse affect on our business 

  

in many of the foreign countries in which we market our products we are subject to regulations affecting among other things product standards packaging requirements labeling requirements import restrictions tariff regulations duties and tax requirements many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the fda in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be 

  

marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility to date we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations due to the movement towards harmonization of standards in the european union we expect a changing regulatory environment in europe characterized by a shift from a country bycountry regulatory system to a european unionwide single regulatory system we cannot currently predict the timing of this harmonization our failure to receive or delays in the receipt of relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval which could harm our reputation business and financial results 

  

after a device is placed on the market numerous regulatory requirements apply including the fda’s quality system regulation or qsr which requires manufacturers to follow design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process labeling regulations which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “offlabel” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to fda or similar governmental bodies in other countries if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur the fda and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing or labeling errors or design defects any voluntary or government mandated recall may divert management attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers any recall involving one of our products could also harm the reputation of the product and the company and would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 

  

changes in government regulation of the retail optical industry or in the selling and prescribing practices for contact lenses could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon the success of our customers who prescribe and fit contact lenses including optometrists ophthalmologists and optical retail outlets which are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances these regulations relate to who is permitted to prescribe and fit contact lenses the prescriber’s obligation to provide prescriptions to its patients the length of time a prescription is valid the ability or obligation of prescribers to prescribe lenses by brand rather than by generic equivalent or specification and other matters the state and local legal requirements vary widely among jurisdictions and are subject to frequent change 

  

in addition numerous healthcarerelated legislative proposals have been made in recent years in the congress and in various state legislatures for instance the fairness to contact lens consumers act which was enacted on december 6 2003 requires that contact lens prescribers provide patients with a copy of their contact lens prescriptions after a contact lens fitting and verify those prescriptions to any third party designated by a patient such as an online seller further legislative or policy initiatives directed at prescribers and the retail optical industry could be introduced on either the federal or state level the potential impact of these proposals with respect to the business of our customers is uncertain and we cannot assure you that that the proposals if adopted would not have a material adverse impact on our revenues business financial condition and results of operations 

  

adverse regulatory or other decisions affecting eyecare practitioners or material changes in the selling and prescribing practices for contact lenses could also have a material adverse affect on our business operating results and financial condition finally although cost controls or other requirements imposed by third party healthcare payors such as insurers and health maintenance organizations have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices this could change in the future and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could materially adversely affect our business 

  

in recent years an increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in congress and in state legislatures that could effect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level among the proposals under consideration are price controls on hospitals insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of a government health insurance plan or plans that would cover all citizens there continue to be efforts at the federal level to introduce various insurance market reforms expanded fraud and abuse and anti referral legislation and further reductions in medicare and medicaid coverage and reimbursement a broad range of both similar and more comprehensive healthcare reform initiatives is likely to be considered at the state level it is uncertain which if any of these or other proposals will be adopted we cannot predict the effect such reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business 

  

the costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

other federal legislation will affect the manner in which we use and disclose health information the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa mandates among other things the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices the us department of health and human services hhs has released three rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information the first rule requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions including healthcare claims information plan eligibility referral certification and authorization claims status plan enrollment and disenrollment payment and remittance advice plan premium payments and coordination of benefits the second rule released by hhs imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information these standards not only require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of protected health information but they also require an entity subject to hipaa to obtain satisfactory assurances that any of its business associates to whom such information is disclosed will safeguard the information the third rule released by hhs establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information while we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under hipaa many of our customers are covered entities subject to hipaa such customers may require us to enter into business associates agreements which obligate us to safeguard certain health information we obtain in the course of servicing the customers restrict the manner in which we use and disclose such information and impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations the costs of complying with these contractual obligations and potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and results of operations 

  

federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and physician selfreferral laws violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions including in some instances exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs including medicare medicaid veterans administration health programs and tricare while we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws because of the complex and farreaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of its practices to be in compliance with these laws any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition if there is a change in law regulation administrative or judicial interpretation we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

united states tax court litigation on september 29 2004 the internal revenue service irs issued notices of deficiency to ocular in connection with its audit of ocular’s income tax returns for the years 1999 2000 and 2001 the notice primarily pertains to transfer pricing issues and an alternative adjustment under the antideferral provisions of subpart f of the internal revenue code and asserts that 448 million of additional taxes is owed for these years plus unspecified interest and approximately 127 million in related penalties 

  

on december 29 2004 ocular filed a petition for the united states tax court to redetermine the deficiencies asserted by the irs on february 11 2005 the irs filed its answer to the petition generally denying the various arguments made by ocular against the assertions of the irs the company believes that the irs may not have fully reviewed the facts before making its assessment of additional taxes and that its position misapplies the law and is incorrect discovery began on march 7 2005 and the company intends to fully access the work product of the irs to more fully ascertain an understanding of its position 

  

the amount of taxes paid for these years was supported by pricing studies performed by an international firm of tax advisors the resulting intercompany transactions and tax payments reflected pricing terms that were and are consistent with industry practice for arm’s length transactions with unrelated third parties the company intends to vigorously contest the irs’s claims and believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on financial condition liquidity or cash flow of the company 

  

the company continues to be subject to the examination of ocular’s income tax returns by the irs and other fiscal authorities and we cannot assure that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial condition moreover the company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where it has higher statutory rates or lower than expected in countries where it has lower statutory rates by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof

cooper’s two business units coopervision cvi and coopersurgical csi generate all its sales 

  

   

   

our consolidated net sales grew by 65 in 2005 and 19 in 2004 cvi has consistently achieved doubledigit net sales growth over the threeyear period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions csi achieved 7 net sales growth in 2005 primarily driven by organic growth and doubledigit growth in the prior two periods driven by acquisition and organic growth

csi net sales 

  

women’s healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians’ and gynecologists’ practices generate about 90 of csi’s revenue the balance are sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare where csi does not actively market in 2005 csi’s sales increased 7 to 1087 million 72 million above 2004 csi’s core revenue grew 10 while unit growth and product mix influenced organic revenue growth average realized prices by product did not materially influence such growth 

  

results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date acquisitions completed in fiscal 2004 are discussed under “2004 compared with 2003” in the “csi net sales” section

cvi net sales 

  

practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change the major shifts are from 

  

   

   

   

some of these shifts favor cvi’s line of specialty products which now comprise 50 of cvi’s worldwide business 

  

definitions contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional disposable and singleuse spherical lenses some of which are aspherically designed and specialty lenses  toric lenses cosmetic lenses longterm extended wear lenses and multifocal lenses core product revenue includes specialty lenses and singleuse spherical lenses 

  

   

   

   

   

   

sales growth includes continued global market gains during the year including increases in disposable spherical sales up 121 disposable toric sales up 62 disposable multifocal sales up 142 and total toric sales up 51 cvi’s core product lines grew 76 with specialty lens growth of 46 during the year sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of proclear ® toric that increased 62 to 254 million and the launch of proclear ® multifocal lenses with 2005 sales of 106 million singleuse lens revenue was 724 million during the year sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses and daily disposable spheres while unit growth and product mix influenced sales growth average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales growth 

  

cvi results include ocular beginning on january 6 2005 when cooper acquired ocular to present cvi’s organic growth we have adjusted reported sales in this discussion for ocular’s unaudited net sales when cooper did not own ocular of 2693 million for january 6 2004 through october 31 2004 with cvi’s reported net sales of 3887 million for cooper’s fiscal 2004 organic net sales grew 6 4 in constant currency americas sales grew 1 european sales grew 8 5 in constant currency

cvi new products and markets 

  

during 2005 cvi lost on an organic basis market share in the twoweek spherical lens market in the united states new product introductions during 2006 are aimed at growing our revenue and stabilizing our market share 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

outlook 

  

we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical and specialty contact lenses in the us market demographics are favorable as the teenage population the age when most contact lens wear begins is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades the reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide cvi expects greater market penetration in europe and asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses 

  

the acquisition of ocular has produced a number of benefits to the company including new technologies particularly patented silicone hydrogel and singleuse lens technologies new geographic markets particularly japan and germany and higher volume manufacturing processes particularly the gen ii platform cvi will continue to invest in gen ii which it expects will generate significant gross 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

margin improvement as it continues to implement and convert products to this manufacturing platform through the end of 2007 singleuse lenses continue to produce doubledigit sales growth in all major markets cvi now has a strengthening presence in japan 

  

we anticipate that csi will continue to consolidate the women’s healthcare market favorable demographic trends also support csi’s business the women of the “babyboomer” generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures are performed most frequently and csi has through both acquisition and internal development built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients 

  

in november 2005 csi acquired neosurg technologies inc a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery and inlet medical inc a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits these purchases advance csi’s expansion within the rapidly developing hospital segment of women’s healthcare cooper paid about 50 million for the two companies csi plans to develop a separate surgical sales force beginning in 2006 and expects additional selling and interest costs attributed to these transactions

cvi’s 2004 revenue growth included continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric revenue up 45 total toric product revenue up 22 and disposable sphere revenue up 20 cvi’s line of specialty lenses grew 23 during the year sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continued to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of proclear ® toric and multifocal lenses which respectively increased 96 and 94 to 157 million and 114 million in the twelvemonth period since the acquisition of biocompatibles in fiscal 2002 cvi has actively marketed proclear ® lenses in many cases practitioners now recommend proclear ® lenses rather than older cvi products while unit growth and product mix influenced revenue growth average realized prices by product did not materially influence revenue growth

cvi net sales 

  

   

international sales grew 24 12 in constant currency to 204 million in 2004 led by sales of twoweek and monthly sphere products which grew 233 million or 27 also sales of twoweek and monthly toric products grew 62 or 209 million international sales growth in 2004 was partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of 17 and 16 respectively 

  

2004 sales in the united states grew 12 in fiscal 2004 primarily due to sales of twoweek and monthly toric products which grew 32 to 563 million also sales of the biocompatibles product lines especially the sales of proclear ® specialty lenses enhanced revenue growth

cost of salesgross profit 

  

   

cvi’s gross margin for fiscal 2005 at 62 was lower than 2004 and 2003 the decrease was primarily due to the 168 million impact related to the inventory step up adjustment recorded at the acquisition of ocular and recognized in cost of sales and 54 million of restructuring expenses during the year in addition we have lower gross margin on singleuse lenses that now account for about 10 of cvi’s net sales about 46 of lens units are manufactured in the united kingdom the favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs 

  

csi’s gross margin improved to 57 in 2005 from 55 in 2004 as we completed the integration of acquisitions including milex and shutdown and integrated our sweden manufacturing facility into the united states 

  

selling general and administrative expense sga 

  

   

consolidated sga increased by 56 in 2005 and 17 in 2004 in support of the increase in sales acquisitions primarily ocular contributed largely to the increase in sga in 2005 as a percentage of net sales consolidated sga decreased to 37 in fiscal 2005 from 39 in 2004 and 40 in 2003 about 4 million of such decrease was due to the relative weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies on about 1338 million of sga outside the us 

  

cvi’s sga increased 64 in 2005 primarily due to the acquisition of ocular and 16 in 2004 sga as a percentage of net sales decreased to 35 in 2005 from 38 in 2004 on reductions of selling marketing and distribution costs 

  

csi’s 2005 sga increased 19 over 2004 which supported the 7 increase in sales selling and marketing costs increased to support csi’s initiative to increase organic growth by continuing the 2004 initiative to expand its direct sales force in 2004 sga increased 35 over 2003 which supported csi’s initiative to increase organic growth 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

corporate headquarters’ sga which increased 59 to 171 million in 2005 decreased to 21 of consolidated net sales from 22 in 2004 and 29 in 2003 these expenses included added costs due to the ocular acquisition continued expenses for projects and staff to maintain the company’s global trading arrangement and costs to comply with corporate governance requirements headquarters’ 2004 expenses decreased 9 to 107 million over 2003 as expenses to maintain our global trading arrangement declined 

  

research and development expense 

  

research and development expense exclusive of 20 million of acquired inprocess research and development related to the acquisition of ocular was 3 of net sales in fiscal 2005 and 1 of net sales in fiscal 2004 and 2003 229 million in 2005 65 million in 2004 and 56 million in 2003 

  

cvi research and development expenditures exclusive of 20 million of acquired inprocess research and development related to the acquisition of ocular were 198 million up 401 over 2004 cvi’s research and development activities include programs to develop twoweek disposable and continuous wear silicone hydrogel lenses a disposable multifocal toric and a twoweek disposable lens incorporating the proclear ® technology csi’s research and development expenditures of 31 million up 22 were for upgrading and redesign of many csi products in osteoporosis invitro fertilization incontinence assisted reproductive technology and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities 

  

restructuring 

  

restructuring expenses of 85 million in 2005 included 61 million of nonacquisition expenses resulting from changes made as a result of the integration of ocular with cvi and 24 million related to integration activities of csi 

  

in connection with the january 6 2005 acquisition of ocular we are in the process of completing an integration plan to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies these activities include integrating duplicate facilities expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices and integrating the worldwide sales and marketing organizations integration activities began in january 2005 and are expected to continue through 2007 

  

we estimate that the total restructuring costs under this integration plan will be approximately 25 –30 million and will be reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of income see note 2 acquisitions 

  

amortization of intangibles 

  

amortization of intangibles was 117 million in 2005 21 million in 2004 and 15 million in 2003 amortization expense increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to acquired intangible assets in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2005 cooper finalized the allocation of the purchase price of ocular cooper adjusted its original allocation estimates by allocating an additional 100 million to other intangible assets from goodwill and recognizing 4 million net of tax of additional amortization for the fiscal year we have restated our quarterly financial data as if the final purchase price allocation was made at the acquisition date of january 6 2005 see note 14 selected quarterly financial data unaudited

other income net 

  

   

in fiscal 2005 we sold the remaining 292000 shares of quidel stock realizing a gain of about 120000 and wrote off the debt issuance costs of our previous credit agreement of 16 million the realized gain on derivative instruments of 19 million relates to effective hedges in the form of interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment which were terminated and replaced with interest rate swaps that did qualify for hedge accounting treatment we expect the new swaps to qualify for hedge accounting through their maturities see note 7 financial instruments 

  

in 2005 we recognized a net loss of about 376000 primarily related to the british pound weakening against the us dollar in 2004 the british pound strengthened against the us dollar resulting in a net gain of about 69000 in 2003 the british pound strengthened against the us dollar resulting in a net gain of about 18 million when we acquired biocompatibles we inherited intercompany accounts in various currencies primarily british pounds 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense increased 373 to 281 million in 2005 from 6 million in 2004 and 7 million in 2003 on january 6 2005 we replaced our 225 million credit facility with a 750 million credit agreement primarily to fund the acquisition of ocular due to the acquisition we had 5572 million in loans on our credit facility at october 31 2005 compared to 499 million outstanding on october 31 2004 

  

on december 12 2005 we amended and restated our 750 million syndicated credit facility the amendment and restatement extended maturities and provided the company with additional borrowing

flexibility and lower overall pricing the amendment refinanced the 465 million outstanding of term a and term b loans under the prior facility and is comprised of a revolving credit facility which was increased from 275 million to 500 million and a 250 million term loan in addition the company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional 250 million keybank led the amendment process which resulted in substantially all original syndicate banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement the amendment significantly reduces principal payment requirements in 2006 through 2009 we expect to write off about 4 million of debt issuance costs as a result of amending the original facility see note 13 subsequent events 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate etr for fiscal 2005 was 154 down from fiscal 2004’s etr of 175 and fiscal 2003’s etr of 24 the reduction of our etr resulted from a greater percentage of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate 

  

we implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal 1999 to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our net operating losses nol the global trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the cvi foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

working capital decreased 68 million in fiscal 2005 due to decreases of 85 million in cash and 18 million in marketable securities from sales of securities and increases of 946 million in current accrued liabilities and accounts payable and 514 million of shortterm debt these changes were partially offset by increases of 781 million in inventory 533 million in receivables and 182 million in current deferred tax assets and other the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the acquisition of ocular however smaller acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange also contributed to the decrease 

  

at the end of fiscal 2005 cooper’s inventory months on hand was 67 as compared to 69 at fiscal year end 2004 cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding dso’s at the end of the current year declining to 62 days from 65 days at october 31 2004 looking forward we expect dso’s in the mid to upper 60’s given our expectations for continued strong growth outside the united states where dso’s are higher based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 

  

investing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 7423 million for investing activities in 2005 was driven by payments of 6270 million for acquisitions primarily the purchase of ocular and capital expenditures of 1171 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and to continue the rollout of new information systems the cash outflow was partially offset by 18 million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities 

  

financing cash flows 

  

the cash inflow of 5518 million from financing activities in 2005 was driven by proceeds from debt of 8164 million and 252 million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by repayment of debt of 2798 million payment of debt acquisition costs of 77 million and dividends on our common stock of 23 million paid in the first and third quarters of 2005

risk management 

  

most of our operations outside of the united states have their local currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations’ functional currency we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the london interbank offered rate we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging 500 million of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for periods of three months to 2 1  4 years and issuing fixed rate debt in the form of 2625 convertible debentures see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies 

  

outlook 

  

we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of 308 million plus cash generated by operating activities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends and smaller acquisitions at october 31 2005 we had 1793 million available under the 750 million syndicated bank credit facility see note 13 subsequent events for the effect of our december 12 2005 refinancing of the credit facility

results of operations – continued 

  

principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values under sfas 123r the pro forma disclosures previously permitted no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition sfas 123r was originally effective for all interim or annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 with early adoption encouraged in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission the “sec” postponed the effective date of sfas 123r until the issuer’s first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 

  

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 regarding the sec’s interpretations of sfas 123r and the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies 

  

cooper will adopt sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective method which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock upon adoption cooper will apply both the blackscholes and binomial valuation models to estimate the fair value of sharebased payments to employees which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period 

  

cooper is evaluating the requirements of sfas 123r and sab 107 and expects that the adoption of sfas 123r on november 1 2005 will have a material impact on cooper’s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 cooper’s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by cooper’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact resulting in uncertainty as to whether future stockbased compensation expense will be similar to the historical sfas 123 pro forma expense these variables include but are not limited to the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 

  

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods

the fasb statement no 142 goodwill impairment test is a twostep process initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 

  

our reporting units are the same as our business segments – coopervision and coopersurgical – reflecting the way that we manage our business our most recent estimate of fair value at the time of our may 1 2005 review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples for cvi ranged from 19 billion to 36 billion compared to a carrying value of 17 billion and for csi ranged from 260 million to 436 million compared to a carrying value of 174 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

note numbers refer to the “notes to consolidated financial statements” beginning on page 57 of this form 10k 

  

the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the company’s policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes additional information for this item is incorporated by reference to “derivatives” in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and in note 7 financial instruments 

  

longterm debt 

  

total debt increased to 7049 million at october 31 2005 from 1657 million at october 31 2004 primarily due to the financing required for the acquisition of ocular longterm debt includes 115 million of convertible senior debentures see “convertible senior debentures” in note 6 debt issued in fiscal year 2003 and the proceeds were used to reduce amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility and for additional funding requirements 

  

   

as of october 31 2005 the scheduled maturities of the company’s fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations excluding capitalized leases their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows 

  

   

as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of october 31 2005 it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on interest rates the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time we currently are entered into interest rate swaps designed to fix the borrowing costs related to 500 million of the company’s floating rate syndicated bank credit facility if interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1 or 100 basis points interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by approximately 920000 annually

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

the company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

as required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 under the securities exchange act of 1934 management with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report as further discussed below a material weakness was identified in the company’s internal control over financial reporting the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 2 defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected as a result of the material weakness the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of october 31 2005 the end of the period covered by this report the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the company files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting  

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements errors or fraud also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management has excluded certain divisions of ocular sciences inc which was acquired on january 6 2005 from its assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 the divisions of ocular excluded from our evaluation of our internal control over financial 

  

reporting represent approximately 11 of our consolidated assets 4 of consolidated liabilities and 26 of consolidated revenues as of and for the year ended october 31 2005 

  

management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework  this assessment identified the following material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of october 31 2005 

  

the company did not have sufficient personnel with adequate knowledge regarding accounting for acquisitions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in addition the company did not have policies and procedures regarding a periodic review of existing accrued liabilities related to business combinations this material weakness resulted in the restatement of the company’s previously issued financial statements for the quarters ended january 31 april 30 and july 31 2005 to correct errors related to the purchase price allocation and resulting amortization of intangible assets acquired in the ocular acquisition in addition similar errors were identified in the company’s october 31 2005 financial statements prior to the issuance of such financial statements 

  

based on this assessment management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of october 31 2005 

  

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data page 51 for their auditors’ report 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

as of october 31 2005 there had been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

subsequent to october 31 2005 management began the process of remediating the aforementioned material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting the remediation actions we have taken or plan to undertake include 

  

   

   

   

we began implementing these changes in our internal control over financial reporting after october 31 2005 management believes the measures that have been or will be implemented to remediate the material weakness will have a significant and positive impact on the company’s internal control over financial reporting subsequent to october 31 2005 the remediation is expected to be completed prior to april 30 2006 and it is anticipated that these measures and other ongoing enhancements will continue to strengthen the company’s internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business  

  

the cooper companies inc the “company” “cooper” “we” and similar pronouns through its principal business units markets develops and manufactures healthcare products cooper is a delaware corporation that was organized in 1980 

  

coopervision cvi markets develops and manufactures a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market it specializes in toric lenses that correct astigmatism cosmetic lenses that change the appearance of the color of the eye and other lenses primarily high growth specialty and valueadded market segments around the world its leading products are disposable and planned replacement toric and spherical lenses coopersurgical csi markets develops and manufactures 

  

medical devices diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians 

  

cvi and csi each operate in a highly competitive environment competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease both of cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability 

  

coopervision 

  

we estimate that the worldwide soft contact lens market grew about 14 percent during 2004 to about 4 billion annually in the united states about 38 percent of the worldwide market revenue grew about 7 percent to 15 billion while revenue in countries outside the united states grew 19 percent to 25 billion 

  

japan and the pacific rim countries about 12 billion or 30 percent of the world market grew about 26 percent europe about 1 billion or 25 percent of the market grew about 18 percent 

  

favorable demographics an increase in the reported incidence of myopia a slowing of the contact lens wearers drop out rates and a continuing shift in practitioner preferences from lowfeatured “commodity” lenses to highervalue specialty lenses support a favorable world market outlook 

  

coopervision is particularly strong in the specialty lens segments of the market toric lenses that correct astigmatism cosmetic lenses that change or enhance the appearance of the color of the eye lenses for patients who experience the symptoms of dry eye syndrome longterm extended wear lenses and multifocal lenses for presbyopia – the blurring of near vision that occurs with aging 

  

these product lines offer contact lens wearers more benefits that include improved visual acuity and added comfort coopervision estimates that specialty lenses currently account for about 30 percent or 12 billion of the worldwide contact lens market about 40 percent of the us market and about 20 percent of the market outside the us where with its broad specialty products lines cvi has an exceptional opportunity to expand their acceptance 

  

cvi’s 2004 revenue growth 

  

cvi’s revenue grew 18 percent in 2004 in contrast we estimate that the world market grew about 14 percent before currency translation adjustment of about 6 percent cvi’s revenue in the united states grew 12 percent and 24 percent in markets outside the us cvi now holds about 13 percent of the united states market and about 10 percent of the worldwide market the latter up from 6 percent three years ago 

  

specialty contact lenses 

  

specialty contact lenses meet the visual correction needs of patients whose requirements go beyond the correction of near and farsightedness we estimate that products in these categories account for about onethird of worldwide contact lens revenue 

  

in the united states we estimate that sales of specialty products are about 700 million above 45 percent of the total united states market in addition to toric and cosmetic lenses multifocal lenses 

  

lenses for patients who experience the symptoms of dry eye syndrome and longterm extended wear lenses also offer attractive business opportunities in 2004 sales of cvi’s toric lenses its most extensive product line grew 22 percent and now account for about 40 percent of its total revenue we estimate that the worldwide toric market grew about 18 percent during this period 

  

worldwide growth in the cosmetic lens market remained flat we estimate sales of approximately 250 million in this category – about 175 million in the united states 

  

new specialty contact lens products 

  

during 2004 cvi expanded its product offerings 

  

   

   

cvi growth in markets outside the united states 

  

in 2004 cvi’s revenue in markets outside the united states grew 24 percent and now represents about 52 percent of its sales 

  

europe 

  

cvi’s european revenue grew about 25 percent over 2003 with strength in sales of toric lenses which grew 42 percent cvi estimates that it is the third largest contact lens supplier in europe with business units in holland italy portugal sweden spain and the united kingdom a subsidiary and an exclusive distributor in france and an exclusive distributor in germany 

  

far east 

  

cvi’s revenue in japan and the pacific rim grew about 27 over 2003 the year rohto pharmaceutical company ltd introduced cvi’s line of frequently replaced lenses including spherical aspheric and toric lenses japan is the second largest contact lens market in the world after the united states and soft lens popularity continues to grow cvi estimates that the total market for soft contact lenses in japan and the pacific rim today is about 12 billion compared to about 15 billion in the united states the japanese market growing in the midteens percent per year is largely made up of daily and twoweek disposable lenses representing about 75 percent of the market 

  

the incidence of nearsightedness in japan is one of the highest in the world about 80 percent of the nearsighted population has some degree of astigmatism significantly greater than the 50 percent rate reported in the united states about half of those with astigmatism are potential candidates for toric lenses the japanese toric segment currently a smaller percentage of the total market than it is in the us is expected to grow rapidly as newer generations of toric lenses are introduced 

  

cvi competition 

  

a number of manufacturers compete in the worldwide market for contact lenses which was approximately 4 billion in 2004 the three largest are johnson  johnson’s vistakon division ciba visionwesley jessen owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated 

  

the contact lens market has two major segments the larger “commodity” segment about 28 billion in 2004 is comprised of lenses that only correct near and farsightedness the smaller “specialty” segment about 12 billion in 2004 is comprised of lenses that address special needs of contact lens patients and includes toric cosmetic multifocal and premium lenses coopervision competes successfully in the contact lens market primarily by offering specialty lenses and secondarily by offering commodity lenses about 62 of cvi’s sales are specialty lenses 

  

to compete successfully in the contact lens market companies must market differentiated products priced competitively and therefore manufactured efficiently cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast molding and fips a cost effective combination of lathing and molding this manufacturing flexibility means that cvi can 

  

   

   

in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through its use of the lens edge technology provided under the patents covered by its edge patent license described under “patents trademarks and licensing agreements” cvi also sponsors clinical studies to generate medical information to improve its lenses 

  

in order to enhance its competitiveness in the specialty market cooper acquired biocompatibles eye care inc biocompatibles the contact lens business of biocompatibles plc in february 2002 biocompatibles’ proclear ® line spherical multifocal and toric lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a material that incorporates the proprietary phosphorylcholine technology that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear ® is the only lens with fda clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear” mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear 

  

toric contact lenses correct astigmatism irregularities of the cornea and accounted for about 13 percent of the total worldwide contact lens market in 2004 cvi’s toric lens sales represented about onethird of this market segment in 2004 

  

the toric market segment is highly competitive cvi’s primary toric competitors are ciba visionwesley jessen owned by novartis ag bausch  lomb incorporated and johnson  johnson’s vistakon division ocular sciences inc also competed in the toric market toric lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients and contact lens practitioners cvi believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors providing greater patient and practitioner satisfaction and better visual acuity and that it offers superior customer services including high standards of ontime product delivery 

  

major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces than cvi nevertheless cvi offers a high level of customer service through its several direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service 

  

representatives who consult with eyecare professionals about the use of the company’s lens products cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well equipped through extensive training to meet the needs of contact lens practitioners and their customers 

  

cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects the company believes that cvi will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share the company also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales of contact lenses because each modality serves a different demographic group almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties while refractive surgical procedures are performed primarily on patients in their late thirties or early forties 

  

coopersurgical 

  

historically many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system csi’s strategy is to identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas particularly opportunities in aging and infertility 

  

cooper’s strong cash flow allows csi to readily compete for these opportunities and csi is now a leader in women’s healthcare having added 25 major products or product lines since 1994 

  

women’s health background 

  

medical economists expect patient visits to obstetricians and gynecologists obgyns to increase by 13 percent over the next decade driving this growth is a large group of women of childbearing age and a rapidly growing middleaged population with emerging gynecologic concerns consistent with an aging population menopausal problems – abnormal bleeding incontinence and osteoporosis – will increase while pregnancy contraceptive management and general examinations are expected to remain stable the trend toward delaying the age of childbearing to the midthirties and beyond will drive increasing treatment for infertility 

  

women between the ages of 18 and 44 generate the highest number of office visits and hospital admissions while general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care about onethird of all office visits for this age group are to the obgyn who are therefore the primary market target for associated medical devices there are nearly 30000 obgyn’s under the age of 65 practicing at nearly 13700 locations in the united states and women account for nearly 60 percent of all inpatient hospital stays 

  

some significant features of this market are 

  

   

   

   

   

csi’s 2004 revenue growth 

  

during 2004 csi revenue grew 23 percent to 1015 million representing 21 percent of cooper’s revenue its operating margin reached 21 percent for the fiscal year below last year’s 22 percent as the company elected to invest in expanding its sales force to stimulate organic revenue growth rates 

  

csi competition 

  

csi focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories in some instances csi offers all of the products needed for a complete procedure the market segments in which csi competes continue to be fragmented typified by smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi believes that it competes successfully against these companies with its superior sales and marketing the technological advantages of its products and by developing and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures in addition as csi expands its product line it offers to train medical professionals how to use them 

  

during 2004 following the acquisition of milex csi implemented an initiative to expand its sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years these programs will focus on csi’s products in the incontinence infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of independent and direct sales representatives 

  

profiles of recent acquisitions 

  

ocular sciences inc – see note 13 “subsequent events” 

  

on january 6 2005 cooper acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ocular sciences inc ocular pursuant to the july 28 2004 definitive merger agreement ocular is a global manufacturer and marketer of soft contact lenses primarily spherical and daily disposable contact lenses that are brand and product differentiated by distribution channel the aggregate consideration paid for the stock of ocular was about 12 billion plus transaction costs less acquired cash cooper paid approximately 600 million in cash and issued approximately 107 million shares of its common stock to ocular stockholders and option holders under the terms of the acquisition each share of ocular common stock was converted into the right to receive 03879 of a share of cooper common stock and 2200 in cash without interest plus cash for fractional shares outstanding ocular stock options were redeemed 

  

in exchange for a combination of cash and cooper stock for the spread between their exercise prices and the value of the merger consideration immediately prior to closing 

  

opticentre 

  

in march 2004 cvi acquired all the outstanding shares and certain patents of les laboratoires opticentre inc a quebecbased contact lens manufacturer which holds the patents covering coopervision’s multifocal lens design technology used in its frequency ® and proclear ® multifocal products 

  

argus biomedical pty ltd 

  

in february 2004 cvi acquired from argus biomedical pty ltd the assets related to alphacor ®  an artificial cornea and alphasphere ®  a soft orbital implant argus is a privately owned company with its origins in the biomaterial and polymer research group of the lions eye institute in western australia 

  

the alphacor ® artificial cornea is a synthetic onepiece device designed to replace a diseased or damaged cornea or a failed human corneal graft alphasphere ® is a soft orbital implant that argus is currently developing orbital implants are required when an eye is lost due to disease or trauma the orbital implant occupies the space usually filled by the eyeball and provides substantial cosmetic benefits to the patient 

  

the argus products are being developed and marketed to corneal surgeons by coopervision’s ophthalmic surgery business unit coopervision surgical inc 

  

milex 

  

in february 2004 csi acquired milex products inc a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services milex is a leading supplier of pessaries – products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions – and also supplies cancer screening products including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices and a breast biopsy needle for fine needle aspiration milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues breast health menopause and osteoporosis 

  

surx inc 

  

in november 2003 csi purchased from privatelyheld surx inc the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the laparoscopic lp and transvaginal tv product lines of its radio frequency rf bladder neck suspension technology which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence 

  

rf bladder neck suspension is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat genuine stress incontinence using low power bipolar rf energy the procedure shrinks tissue in the pelvic floor to lift the urethra and bladder neck to a more normal anatomical position this procedure can be performed using either a laparoscopic or a transvaginal approach 

  

the surx ® system consists of a small lightweight 15 watt surx ® radio frequency generator that delivers rf energy to a singleuse handheld applicator for each surgical approach 

  

research and development 

  

our companysponsored research and development expenditures during the fiscal years ended october 31 2004 2003 and 2002 were 65 million 56 million and 43 million respectively representing 1 of net sales in each fiscal year during fiscal 2004 coopervision spent 61 and coopersurgical spent 39 of the total we did not participate in any customersponsored research and development programs 

  

cooper employs 33 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments outside specialists in lens design formulation science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support product development and clinical research for cvi products csi conducts research and development inhouse and also employs outside surgical specialists including members of its surgical advisory board 

  

cvi continues to invest in two research programs the development of an extended wear contact lens and an improved contact lens technology most of our rd expense other than the two programs is for clinical regulatory and other product development activities and not for basic research 

  

government regulation 

  

the us food and drug administration fda other federal agencies and various foreign ministries of health regulate the development testing production and marketing of the company’s products the federal food drug and cosmetic act and other statutes and regulations govern the testing manufacturing labeling storage advertising and promotion of these products if applicable regulations are not followed companies may be subject to fines product recall or seizure suspension of production and criminal prosecution 

  

both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require substantially lower levels of regulation 

  

before a new contact lens can be sold commercially cvi must complete these steps 1 compile data on its chemistry and toxicology 2 determine its microbiological profile and 3 define the proposed manufacturing process this data must be submitted to the fda to support an application for an investigational device exemption once this is granted clinical trials can begin these are subject to review and approval by an institutional review board and where a lens is determined to have a significant risk the fda after the clinical trials are completed a premarket approval application must be submitted to and approved by the fda 

  

in connection with some of cooper’s new products we can submit an expedited procedure known as a 510k application for premarket notification to the fda any product that can demonstrate that it is substantially equivalent to another device marketed before may 28 1976 can use this procedure if the new product is not substantially equivalent to a preexisting device or if the fda rejects a claim of substantial equivalence fda marketing clearance requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing substantially increasing the cost and delaying the time to market 

  

fda and state regulations also require the company to adhere to applicable “good manufacturing practices” gmp they require detailed quality assurance and record keeping and make periodic unscheduled regulatory inspections the company believes it is in compliance with gmp regulations 

  

health authorities in foreign countries regulate cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there 

  

these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing cooper cannot assure that all necessary approvals will be obtained or obtained in a timely manner if the company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing product approval may be withdrawn 

  

all of cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies and none are being marketed under an investigative device exemption 

  

in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso 9000 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures 

  

raw materials 

  

cvi’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials there are alternative supply sources for each of them raw materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures csi could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice 

  

marketing and distribution 

  

in the united states canada united kingdom brazil portugal italy spain france holland sweden norway australia and south africa cvi markets its products through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists ophthalmologists opticians and optical chains in the united states field sales representatives also call on distributors in japan and other countries outside north america cvi uses distributors and has given most of them the exclusive right to market our products in the united states cvi augments its sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in professional journals 

  

csi’s products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales and marketing activities with ecommerce telemarketing direct mail and advertising in professional journals 

  

patents trademarks and licensing agreements 

  

cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents which in total are material to its overall business the names of certain of cooper’s products are protected by trademark registrations in the united states patent and trademark office and in some cases also in foreign trademark offices applications are pending for additional trademark registrations cooper aggressively defends its intellectual property rights 

  

no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its principal business units other than 

  

   

   

in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property 

  

dependence on customers 

  

neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers 

  

government contracts 

  

neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states government 

  

backlog 

  

backlog is not a material factor in either of cooper’s business units 

  

seasonality 

  

cvi’s contact lens sales in its first fiscal quarter which runs from november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as patient traffic to practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season 

  

compliance with environmental laws 

  

federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment do not currently materially affect cooper’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

working capital 

  

cooper has not required any material working capital arrangements in the past five years

net sales 

  

cooper’s two business units coopervision cvi and coopersurgical csi generate all its sales 

  

   

   

our consolidated net sales grew by 19 in 2004 and 31 in 2003 both cvi and csi have consistently achieved doubledigit net sales growth over the threeyear period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions

growth 

  

   

2004 compared with 2003 

  

cvi net sales 

  

practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change the major shifts are from 

  

   

   

   

these shifts favor cvi’s line of specialty products which comprise over 62 of cvi’s worldwide business and 70 of its revenue in the united states 

  

definitions lens revenue consists of sales of spherical lenses which include aspherically designed lenses and specialty lenses – toric cosmetic multifocal lenses and lenses for patients with dry eyes 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the primary reasons for cvi’s 2004 revenue growth include continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric revenue up 45 total toric product revenue up 22 and disposable sphere revenue up 20 cvi’s line of specialty lenses grew 23 during the year sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of proclear ® toric and multifocal lenses which respectively increased 96 and 94 to 157 million and 114 million in the twelvemonth period while unit

growth and product mix have influenced revenue growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced revenue growth 

  

since the acquisition of biocompatibles in fiscal 2002 cvi has actively marketed proclear ® lenses in many cases practitioners now recommend proclear ® lenses rather than older cvi products 

  

cvi net sales 

  

   

international sales grew 24 12 in constant currency to 204 million in the year led by sales of twoweek and monthly sphere products which grew 233 million or 27 also sales of twoweek and monthly toric products grew 62 or 209 million international sales growth was partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of 17 and 16 respectively 

  

sales in the united states grew 12 in fiscal 2004 primarily due to sales of twoweek and monthly toric products which grew 32 to 563 million also sales of the biocompatibles product lines especially the sales of proclear ® specialty lenses enhanced the revenue growth 

  

cvi new products and markets 

  

during 2004 cvi expanded its product offerings 

  

   

   

outlook 

  

we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable and frequently replaced lenses dpr toric lenses aspheric lenses and newer specialty lenses including proclear ® products for lens wearers who experience mild dry eye discomfort cosmetic lenses both those that change and those that accentuate the eye’s natural color and multifocal lenses in the us market demographics are favorable as the teenaged population the age when most contact lens wear begins is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades the reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide we expect greater market penetration in europe and the far east as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses 

  

the acquisition of ocular sciences inc ocular brings a number of benefits to the company 

  

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we anticipate that cvi will continue its revenue growth at rates faster than the anticipated constant currency market increase of 8  10 

  

csi net sales 

  

women’s healthcare products used primarily in obstetricians’ and gynecologists’ practices generate about 90 of csi’s revenue the balance are sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare where csi does not actively market in 2004 csi’s sales increased 23 to 1015 million 193 million above 2003 primarily due to recent acquisitions organic growth of existing products was about 4 while unit growth and product mix have influenced organic revenue growth average realized prices by product have not materially influenced such growth 

  

results of operations of acquired companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date we discuss acquisitions completed in fiscal 2004 below acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 are discussed under “2003 compared with 2002” in the “csi net sales” section 

  

2004 csi acquisitions see note 2 

  

   

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

demographics 

  

favorable demographic trends also support csi’s business the women of the “babyboomer” generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures are performed most frequently and csi has through both acquisition and internal development built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients 

  

outlook 

  

we anticipate that csi will continue to consolidate the women’s healthcare market fiscal 2005 revenue is expected to range from 115 million to 118 million 

  

during 2004 following the acquisition of milex csi implemented an initiative to expand its sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years these programs will focus on csi’s products in the incontinence infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of independent and direct sales representatives 

  

2003 compared with 2002 

  

cvi net sales 

  

cvi’s worldwide sales grew 35 in fiscal 2003 cvi reported net sales include biocompatibles revenue beginning in march 2002 in the following table we adjust cvi reported sales by adding biocompatibles’ sales for the fourmonth period in fiscal 2002 that we did not own them as shown on the biocompatibles’ unaudited ledgers to the year’s actual results the total represents the lens business we now own 

  

since the acquisition of biocompatibles cvi has actively marketed proclear ® lenses in many cases practitioners now recommend proclear ® lenses rather than older cvi products 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

cvi net sales 

  

   

total adjusted worldwide sales grew 23 16 in constant currency in 2003 

  

international sales grew 25 12 in constant currency to 1648 million in the year led by sales of twoweek and monthly sphere products which grew 247 million or 40 also sales of twoweek and monthly toric products grew 42 or 10 million 

  

adjusted sales in the united states grew 20 in fiscal 2003 primarily due to sales of twoweek and monthly sphere products which grew 33 to 144 million also sales of twoweek and monthly toric products grew 47 to 14 million the acquisition of biocompatibles product lines especially the sales of proclear ® and other specialty lenses enhanced the revenue growth 

  

the primary reasons for the 2003 revenue growth were 

  

   

   

   

csi net sales 

  

women’s healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate about 90 of csi’s sales the balance are sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare where csi does not actively market in 2003 csi’s sales increased 15 to 822 million 108 million above 2002 primarily due to acquisitions the reported growth was slowed by declining sales in more mature product lines softness in the equipment portion of the market and a delay in replacing an invitro fertilization catheter that csi could no longer market when an exclusive distributor relationship ended

results of operations – continued 

  

2003 csi acquisitions see note 2 

  

   

   

2004 compared to 2003 and 2003 compared to 2002 

  

cost of salesgross profit 

  

   

cvi’s gross margin for fiscal 2004 at 67 was equal to 2003 and 2002 cvi manufactures about 66 of its lenses in the united kingdom the favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs in addition we have lower gross margin on sales to asiapacific distributors which increased 27 

  

csi’s gross margin improved to 55 from 54 in 2003 as we completed the integration of acquisitions including prism and avalon 

  

csi’s 2003 gross margin was 54 of net sales up from 51 in 2002 csi’s 2002 margin was 54 prior to the impact of a charge against cost of sales of about 2 million for the phase out of the cerveillance ® colposcopy system 

  

for fiscal 2005 absent the impact of future acquisitions we expect that csi gross margins from recurring activities will improve as we complete integration of recent acquisitions and progress with the initiative to expand sales and marketing efforts targeted at organic growth 

  

selling general and administrative expense sga 

  

   

consolidated sga increased by 17 in 2004 and 29 in 2003 which support the increase in sales as a percentage of net sales consolidated sga was 39 in fiscal 2004 and 40 in 2003 and 2002 

  

cvi’s sga increased 16 in 2004 and 29 in 2003 sga as a percentage of net sales improved to 38 in 2004 from 39 in 2003 on reductions of advertising and distribution costs however selling promotion and distribution costs to introduce new products continued in 2004 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

csi’s 2004 sga increased 35 over 2003 which support the 23 increase in sales selling and marketing costs increased to support csi’s initiative to increase organic growth in 2003 sga increased 16 over 2002 

  

corporate headquarters’ sga decreased to 22 of consolidated net sales from 29 in 2003 and 24 in 2002 headquarters’ 2004 expenses decreased 9 to 107 million as expenses to maintain our global trading arrangement declined headquarters’ 2003 expenses increased 58 over 2002 due to various projects associated with our global trading arrangement 

  

research and development expense 

  

research and development expense was 1 of net sales in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 65 million in 2004 56 million in 2003 and 43 million in 2002 

  

cvi continues to invest in two research programs the development of an extended wear contact lens and an improved contact lens technology most of our rd expense other than the two programs is for clinical regulatory and other product development activities and not for basic research 

  

amortization of intangibles 

  

amortization of intangibles was 21 million in 2004 and 15 million in 2003 and 2002 amortization expense increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to acquired intangible assets 

  

operating income 

  

operating income grew 498 million or 74 between 2002 and 2004

gain on sale of quidel stock 

  

in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 we sold 339725 250000 and 592000 shares of quidel stock and realized gains of approximately 14 million 621000 and 12 million respectively see note 7 

  

gain on litmusquidel transaction 

  

in the first quarter of 2001 quidel corporation quidel acquired litmus concepts inc litmus through an exchange of common stock cooper held a preferred equity position in litmus which equated to approximately a 10 percent ownership as a result of this transaction we received 1138725 shares of quidel’s common stock in the third quarter of 2002 we received an additional 334727 shares of quidel that were held in escrow and recorded a gain of 21 million based on the fair market value of quidel shares on the day we received them 

  

foreign exchange 

  

in 2004 the pound strengthened against the dollar resulting in a net gain of about 69000 we have taken steps to minimize this exposure our policy continues to be to hedge foreign exchange exposure whenever possible 

  

in 2003 the pound strengthened against the dollar resulting in a net gain of about 18 million when we acquired biocompatibles we inherited intercompany accounts in various currencies primarily pounds sterling 

  

in 2002 the acquisition of biocompatibles and additional capitalization for international operations provided about 21 million in pounds sterling to a uk affiliate for shortterm financing while the loans were outstanding the pound strengthened against the dollar and a net gain of about 15 million resulted when the loan was repaid additional gains of 300000 resulted from currency exposures that were acquired and not hedged 

  

settlement of dispute 

  

in 2004 we paid 377000 to settle a legal dispute and in 2003 we paid a onetime fee of 500000 to settle a legal dispute 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 6 million in 2004 7 million in 2003 and 69 million in 2002 interest expense decreased in 2004 reflecting a general decrease in interest rates and reduced debt levels due to strong operating cash flow 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate etr for fiscal 2004 was 175 down from fiscal 2003’s effective tax rate etr of 24 and fiscal 2002’s etr of 25 the reduction of our etr resulted from a greater percent of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate we expect our etr to be 21 for fiscal 2005 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

with anticipated faster growth outside the us and a favorable mix of products manufactured outside the us cooper now expects that its net operating loss carryforwards nols in the us will last through 2007 

  

we implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal 1999 to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our nols the global trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the coopervision foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries 

  

the stock of those subsidiaries is now owned by a single foreign holding company which centrally directs much of the activities of those subsidiaries the foreign holding company has applied for and received the benefits of a reduced tax rate under a special tax regime available in its country of domicile assuming no other major acquisitions or large stock issuance we currently expect that this plan will extend the cash flow benefits of the existing nols through 2007 and that actual cash payments of taxes will average less than 5 of pretax profits over this period after 2007 actual cash payments of taxes are expected to average less than 20 of pretax profits 

  

capital resources and liquidity

comparative statistics 

  

   

operating cash flows 

  

cash flow provided from operating activities continues as cooper’s major source of liquidity totaling 1012 million in fiscal 2004 and 796 million in 2003 

  

major uses of cash for operating activities included payments of 35 million for income taxes 54 million in interest payments 3 million final payment on a previously accrued dispute settlement

results of operations – continued 

  

with medical engineering corporation a subsidiary of bristolmyers squibb company pursuant to a 1993 settlement agreement and 31 million to fund 2003 entitlements under cooper’s bonus plans 

  

working capital increased 392 million in fiscal 2004 as cash decreased 8 million primarily to fund acquisitions marketable securities decreased 39 million from sales of securities and the decline of the market value of securities available for sale current accrued liabilities and accounts payable increased 900000 and shortterm debt increased 200000 partially offset by increases of 179 million in inventory 146 million in receivables and 197 million in current deferred tax assets and other the increase in inventory is due to the growth in the overall business planned inventory increases to improve service levels acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange the increase in receivables is primarily due to the increase in sales 

  

at the end of fiscal 2004 cooper’s inventory months on hand was 69 versus 70 at fiscal year end 2003 cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding dso’s at the end of the current year declining to 65 days from 67 days at october 31 2003 looking forward we expect dso’s in the mid to upper 60’s to low 70’s given continued strong growth expectations outside the united states where dso’s are higher based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 

  

investing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 1006 million for investing activities was driven by payments of 639 million on acquisitions and capital expenditures of 405 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and the continued rollout of new information systems the cash outflow was partially offset by 38 million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities 

  

financing cash flows 

  

the cash outflow of 87 million from financing activities was driven by net repayment of debt of about 205 million and dividends paid on our common stock of 19 million offset by 137 million from the exercise of stock options

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

as of october 31 2004 we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

   

the expected future benefit payments for pension plans for years one through ten are disclosed in note 10 “employee benefits” 

  

risk management see note 1 

  

most of our operations outside of the united states have their reporting currency as their functional currency we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations’ functional currency we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the london interbank offered rate we have decreased this risk by issuing fixed rate debt in the form of 2625 convertible debentures 

  

outlook 

  

we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of 394 million plus cash from operating activities will fund future operations capital expenditures cash dividends and smaller acquisitions at october 31 2004 we had 1431 million available under the keybank line of credit

inflation and changing prices 

  

inflation had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three years 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in october 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf with respect to issue no 048 “the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share” the eitf’s consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

computations of diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met additionally in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards the fasb has issued an exposure draft “earnings per share – an amendment of fasb statement no 128” this exposure draft states that contingent convertible securities which contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share 

  

cooper currently has 115 million of outstanding contingently convertible senior debentures debentures due on july 1 2023 the debentures are convertible into 225201 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of debentures or approximately 26 million shares in our fiscal fourth quarter 2004 the debentures became convertible as our share price exceeded 120 of the conversion price for 20 consecutive trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter ended july 31 2004 however prior to july 1 2008 we may not redeem at our option nor may a holder require us to repurchase any outstanding debentures 

  

during the fourth fiscal quarter 2004 the company elected to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 048 and as a result included the dilutive effect of the debentures in its diluted earnings per share calculation from the time of issuance of the debentures – our fiscal third quarter 2003 in accordance with the ifconverted methodology under fasb statement no 128 accordingly prior period diluted eps has been restated see note 4 

  

in december 2004 fasb issued fasb statement no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” statement 123r it requires that the compensation cost relating to sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued statement 123r replaces fasb statement no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” in effect removing the option stated in fasb no 123 to apply the guidance in opinion 25 this statement is effective as the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 or our fourth fiscal quarter 2005 transition may be accomplished using the modified prospective application or the modified retrospective application 

  

cooper currently measures compensation costs related to sharebased payments under opinion 25 as allowed by fasb no 123 this will affect both our net income and earning per share as determined by the transition methodology in statement 123r 

  

estimates and critical accounting policies 

  

management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable however actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

   

   

   

   

the fasb statement no 142 goodwill impairment test is a twostep process initially we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to them if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment when available and as appropriate we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations – continued 

  

our reporting units are the same as our business segments – coopervision and coopersurgical – reflecting the way that we manage our business our most recent estimate of fair value at the time of our may 1 2004 review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples for coopervision ranged from 1 billion to 16 billion compared to a carrying value of 438 million and for coopersurgical fair value ranged from 317 million to 461 million compared to a carrying value of 167 million 

  

   

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the company’s policy is to minimize to the extent reasonable and practical its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts respectively the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes additional information for this item is incorporated by reference to “derivatives” in note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” and in note 7 “financial instruments” of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

longterm debt 

  

total debt decreased to 1657 million at october 31 2004 from 1859 million at october 31 2003 longterm debt includes 115 million of convertible senior debentures see “convertible senior debentures” in note 6 “debt” issued in fiscal year 2003 and the proceeds were used to reduce amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility and for additional funding requirements 

  

   

as of october 31 2004 the scheduled maturities of the company’s fixed and variable rate longterm debt obligations excluding capitalized leases their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

the company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the securities and exchange commission and that any material information relating to the company is recorded processed summarized and reported to its principal officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

in conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter the company conducts a review and evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon such an evaluation as of october 31 2004 the end of the fiscal year covered by this report concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level

68 and coopersurgical spent 32 of the total we did not participate in any
customersponsored research and development programs

     cooper employs 28 people in its research and development and manufacturing
engineering departments outside specialists in lens design formulation
science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support product
development and clinical research for cvi products csi conducts research and
development inhouse and also employs outside surgical specialists including

government regulation

     the us food and drug administration fda other federal agencies and
various foreign ministries of health regulate the development testing
production and marketing of the companys products the federal food drug and
cosmetic act and other statutes and regulations govern the testing
manufacturing labeling storage advertising and promotion of these products
if applicable regulations are not followed companies may be subject to fines
product recall or seizure suspension of production and criminal prosecution

     both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different levels
of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class iii
devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require extensive
premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require
substantially lower levels of regulation

     before a new contact lens can be sold commercially cvi must complete these
steps 1 compile data on its chemistry and toxicology 2 determine its
microbiological profile and 3 define the proposed manufacturing process this
data must be submitted to the fda to support an application for an
investigational device exemption once this is granted clinical trials can
begin these are subject to review and approval by an institutional review board
and where a lens is determined to have a significant risk the fda after the
clinical trials are completed a premarket approval application must be
submitted to and approved by the fda

     in connection with some of coopers new products we can submit an
expedited procedure known as a 510k application for premarket notification to
the fda any product that can demonstrate that it is substantially equivalent to
another device marketed before may 28 1976 can use this procedure if the new
product is not substantially equivalent to a preexisting device or if the fda
rejects a claim of substantial equivalence fda marketing clearance requires
extensive preclinical and clinical testing substantially increasing the cost
and delaying the time to market


                                        3

     fda and state regulations also require the company to adhere to applicable
good manufacturing practices gmp they require detailed quality assurance
and record keeping and make periodic unscheduled regulatory inspections the
company believes it is in compliance with gmp regulations

     health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical trials
and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to country
even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each country
must approve new products before they may be marketed there

     these regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and
resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product
development and marketing cooper cannot assure that all necessary approvals
will be obtained or obtained in a timely manner if the company does not
maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after
marketing product approval may be withdrawn

     all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all
appropriate regulatory agencies and none are being marketed under an
investigative device exemption

     in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains iso
9000 certification and ce mark approvals for its products a ce mark is an
international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with
applicable european medical device requirements these quality programs and
approvals are required by the european medical device directive and must be
maintained for all products intended to be sold in the european market in order
to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is subjected to rigorous
biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures

raw materials

     cvis raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging
materials there are alternative supply sources for each of them raw materials
used by csi are generally available from more than one source however because
some products require specialized manufacturing procedures csi could experience
inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on
short notice

marketing and distribution

     in the united states canada united kingdom brazil portugal italy
spain france holland sweden finland norway australia and south africa cvi
markets its products through its field sales representatives who call on
optometrists ophthalmologists opticians and optical chains in the united
states field sales representatives also call on distributors in japan and
other countries outside north america cvi uses distributors and has given most
of them the exclusive right to market our products in the united states cvi
augments its sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and
advertising in professional journals

     csis products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and

applications are pending for additional trademark registrations cooper
aggressively defends its intellectual property rights

     no individual patent or license is material to the company or either of its
principal business units other than

o    our nonexclusive patent license agreement dated as of december 2 1997
     between cooper and geoffrey galley albert moreland barry bevis and ivor
     atkinson entered into in connection with the companys acquisition of
     aspect vision care limited the edge patent license this agreement
     expires in january 2010 and relates to patents used by cvi to produce a
     contact lens edge that provides superior comfort to the wearer the edge
     forms a part of cvis products both spherical and toric lenses that are
     manufactured using a cast molding technology in the companys hamble
     england and norfolk virginia facilities

o    our license related to products manufactured by cvi using the proprietary
     phosphorylcholine pc technology patents that we received in connection
     with the companys acquisition of biocompatibles eye care inc our
     proclear compatibles brand of spherical and toric soft contact lenses are
     manufactured using this pc technology

     in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns certain
trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property

dependence on customers

     neither of coopers business segments depends to any material extent on any
one customer or any one affiliated group of customers

government contracts

     neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation
or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the united states

competition

     cvi and csi each operate in a highly competitive environment competition
in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and
therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of disease
both of coopers businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality
and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability

cvi

     a number of manufacturers compete in the worldwide market for contact
lenses which was approximately 35 billion in 2003 the three largest are
johnson  johnsons vistakon division ciba visionwesley jessen owned by
novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated

     the contact lens market has two major segments the larger commodity
segment about 25 billion in 2003 is comprised of lenses that only correct
near and farsightedness the smaller specialty segment about 1 billion in
2003 is comprised of lenses that address special needs of contact lens
patients which includes toric cosmetic multifocal and premium lenses
coopervision competes successfully in the contact lens market primarily by
offering specialty lenses and secondarily by offering commodity lenses about
62 of cvis sales are specialty lenses


                                        5



page


     to compete successfully in the contact lens market companies must market
differentiated products priced competitively and therefore manufactured
efficiently cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use
three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast
molding and fips a cost effective combination of lathing and molding this
manufacturing flexibility means that cvi can

o    develop more lens types for patients than competitors two week monthly
     and quarterly disposable and custom toric products the latter for patients
     with a high amount of astigmatism and

o    offer a wider range of lens parameters leading to a more successful
     fitting with better visual acuity

     in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through
its use of the lens edge technology provided under the patents covered by its
edge patent license described under patents trademarks and licensing
agreement cvi also sponsors clinical studies to generate medical information
to improve its lenses

     in order to enhance its competitiveness in the specialty market cooper
completed the acquisition of biocompatibles eye care inc biocompatibles the
contact lens business of biocompatibles plc in february 2002 biocompatibles
proclear line spherical and toric lenses are manufactured with omafilcon a a
material that incorporates the proprietary phosphorylcholine technology that
helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility proclear is the only lens with fda
clearance for the claim  may provide improved comfort for contact lens
wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during
lens wear mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition
that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear

     toric contact lenses correct astigmatism irregularities of the cornea and
accounted for about 13 of the total worldwide contact lens market in 2003
cvis toric lens sales represented about 30 of this market segment in 2003

     the toric market segment is highly competitive cvis primary toric
competitors are ciba visionwesley jessen owned by novartis ag bausch  lomb
incorporated johnson  johnsons vistakon division and ocular sciences inc
toric lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual
acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters
superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service both for patients
and contact lens practitioners cvi believes that its three manufacturing
processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors
providing greater patient and practitioner satisfaction and better visual
acuity and that it offers superior customer services including high standards
of ontime product delivery

     major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and
development budgets and sales forces than cvi nevertheless cvi offers a high
level of customer service through its several direct sales organizations around
the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who
consult with eyecare professionals about the use of the companys lens products
cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well equipped through
extensive training to meet the need of contact lens practitioners and their
customers

     cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive
surgical procedures that correct visual defects the company believes that cvi
will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets
where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low
offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share the company
also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales
of contact lenses because each modality serves a different demographic group
almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties while
refractive surgical procedures are performed primarily on patients in their late
thirties or early forties

csi

     csi focuses on selected segments of the womens healthcare market
supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments and
accessories in some instances csi offers all of the products needed for a
complete procedure the market segments in which csi competes continue to be
fragmented typified by smaller technologydriven firms that generally offer
only one or two product lines most are privately owned or divisions of public
companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources
than cooper competitive factors in these segments include technological and
scientific advances product quality price customer service and effective
communication of product information to physicians and hospitals csi believes
that it competes successfully against these companies with its superior sales
and marketing the technological advantages of its products and by developing
and acquiring new products including those used in new medical procedures in
addition as csi expands its product line it offers to train medical
professionals how to use them

backlog

item 9a controls and procedures

     the company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and
procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed
in its reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded
processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the
securities and exchange commission and that any material information relating to
the company is recorded processed summarized and reported to its principal
officers to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures in designing
and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized
that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives
and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures

     in conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter the company conducts
a review and evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the
companys management including the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
companys disclosure controls and procedures the companys chief executive
officer and chief financial officer based upon such an evaluation as of october
31 2003 the end of the fiscal year covered by this report concluded that the
companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level

     there has been no change in the companys internal control over financial
reporting during the companys most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal
controls over financial reporting

research and development

          our companysponsored research and development expenditures during the
fiscal years ended october 31 2002 2001 and 2000 were 43 million 37
million and 27 million respectively during fiscal 2002 coopervision spent
about 66 and coopersurgical spent about 34 of the total we did not conduct
any customersponsored research and development programs

          cooper employs 58 people in its research and development and
manufacturing engineering departments outside specialists in lens design
formulation science polymer chemistry microbiology and biochemistry support
product development and clinical research for cvi products csi conducts
research and development inhouse and also employs outside surgical specialists
including members of its surgical advisory board

government regulation

          the us food and drug administration fda other federal agencies
and various foreign ministries of health regulate the development testing
production and marketing of the companys products the federal food drug and
cosmetic act and other statutes and regulations govern the testing
manufacturing labeling storage advertising and promotion of these products
if applicable regulations are not followed companies may be subject to fines
product recall or seizure suspension of production and criminal prosecution

          both cvi and csi develop and market medical devices under different
levels of fda regulation depending on the classification of the device class
iii devices such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses require
extensive premarket testing and approval while class i and ii devices require
substantially lower levels of regulation

          before a new contact lens can be sold commercially cvi must complete
these steps 1 compile data on its chemistry and toxicology 2 determine its
microbiological profile and 3 define the proposed manufacturing process this
data must be submitted to the fda to support an application for an
investigational device exemption once this is granted clinical trials can
begin these are subject to review and approval by an institutional review board
and where a lens is determined to have a significant risk the fda after the
clinical trials are completed a premarket approval application must be
submitted and approved by the fda

          in connection with some of coopers new products we can submit an
expedited procedure known as a 510k application for premarket notification to
the fda any product that can demonstrate that it is substantially equivalent to
another device marketed before may 28 1976 can use this procedure if the new
product is not substantially equivalent to a preexisting device or if the fda
rejects a claim of substantial equivalence fda marketing clearance requires
extensive preclinical and clinical testing substantially increasing the cost
and delaying the time to market

          fda and state regulations also require the company to adhere to
applicable good manufacturing practices gmp they require detailed quality
assurance and record keeping and periodic unscheduled regulatory inspections
the company believes it is in compliance with gmp regulations

          health authorities in foreign countries regulate coopers clinical
trials and medical device sales the regulations vary widely from country to
country even if the fda has approved a product the regulatory agencies in each
country must approve new products before they may be marketed there

          these regulatory procedures require considerable resources and usually
result in a substantial delay between new product development and marketing
cooper cannot assure that all necessary approvals will


                                       3

be obtained or obtained in a timely manner if the company does not maintain
compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing
product approval may be withdrawn

          all of coopers currently marketed products have been cleared by all
appropriate regulatory agencies none of our products are being marketed under
investigative device exemptions

          in addition to fda regulatory requirements the company also maintains
iso 9000 certification and ce mark approvals for all lens products these
quality programs and approvals are required by the european medical device
directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the
european market in order to maintain these quality benchmarks the company is
subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and
procedures

raw materials

          cvis raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and
packaging materials there are alternative supply sources for each of them raw
materials used by csi are generally available from more than one source
however because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures csi
could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative
manufacturer on short notice

marketing and distribution

          in the united states canada united kingdom italy spain france
holland sweden finland norway australia and south africa cvi markets its
products through its field sales representatives who call on optometrists
ophthalmologists opticians and optical chains in the united states field
sales representatives also call on distributors in japan and other countries
outside north america cvi uses distributors and has given most of them the
exclusive right to market our products in the united states cvi augments its
sales and marketing efforts with ecommerce telemarketing and advertising in
professional journals

          csis products are marketed worldwide by a network of field sales
representatives and distributors in the united states csi augments its sales

agreement expires in january 2010 the agreement relates to patents used by cvi
to produce a unique contact lens edge that provides superior comfort to the
wearer the edge forms a part of cvis products both spherical and toric
lenses that are manufactured using a cast molding technology in the companys
hamble england and norfolk virginia usa facilities sales of these products
constituted about 50 of the contact lenses sold by cvi in 2002

contact lenses are manufactured using this pc technology

          in addition to trademarks and patent licenses the company owns
certain trade secrets copyrights knowhow and other intellectual property

competition

          cvi and csi each operate in a highly competitive environment
competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological
and therapeutic innovations in the prevention diagnosis and treatment of
disease both of coopers businesses compete primarily on the basis of product
quality and differentiation technological benefit service and reliability

cvi

          a number of manufacturers compete in the worldwide market for contact
lenses which was approximately 31 billion in 2002 the three largest are
johnson  johnson ciba visionwesley jessen owned by novartis ag and bausch 
lomb incorporated

          the contact lens market has two major segments the larger segment is
lenses that only correct near and farsightedness the commodity segment the
smaller segment is lenses that address special needs of contact lens patients
the specialty segment coopervision competes successfully in the contact
lens market primarily through its ability to market specialty contact lenses
although it also markets commodity lenses in order to satisfy customer demand in
certain areas the specialty lens segment includes toric cosmetic multifocal
and premium lenses in 2002 revenue of this specialty segment totaled about
820 million approximately 70 percent of cvis sales are specialty lenses

          to compete successfully in the contact lens market companies must
market differentiated products priced competitively and therefore manufactured
efficiently and economically

          cvi believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use
three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses lathing cast
molding and fips a cost effective combination of lathing and molding this
manufacturing flexibility means that cvi can

o    develop more lens types for patients than competitors two week monthly
     and quarterly disposable and custom toric products for patients with high
     amount of astigmatism

o    offer a wider range of lens parameters which promote more successful
     fitting and better visual acuity


                                       5





page

          in addition cvi believes that its lenses provide superior comfort
through its use of the edge technology provided under the patents covered by its
license agreement described under patents trademarks and licensing agreement
cvi also sponsors clinical studies to generate medical information to improve
its lenses

          in order to enhance its competitiveness in the specialty market in
february 2002 cooper completed the acquisition of biocompatibles eye care inc
biocompatibles the contact lens business of biocompatibles plc
biocompatibles proclear line of products both spherical and toric lenses are
manufactured with omafilcon a material incorporating the proprietary
phosphorylcholine technology that helps enhance tissuedevice compatibility and
is the only lens with fda clearance for the claim  may provide improved
comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms
relating to dryness during lens wear mild discomfort relating to dryness
during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to drop out of lens
wear

          toric contact lenses that correct astigmatism are an important
specialty lens category they represented about 365 million of the total
worldwide market in 2002 cvi accounted for approximately 110 million in
calendar 2002 or about 30 of this market segment the toric market segment is
highly competitive cvis primary competitors in this segment are ciba
visionwesley jessen owned by novartis ag and bausch  lomb incorporated
competition in the toric market segment is based primarily on how well lenses
provide patients with successful fits and acceptable visual acuity through
offering a wide range of lens parameters superior wearing comfort and both for
patients and contact lens practitioners a high level of customer service cvi
believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric
lens parameters than its competitors allowing for more successful fits and
better visual acuity

          major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research
and development budgets and sales forces than cvi nevertheless cvi offers a
high level of customer service through its direct sales organizations around
the world who present its products to eyecare professionals and through
telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eyecare
professionals about the use of the companys lens products and high standards
of product delivery time cvi believes that its sales force is particularly well
equipped through extensive training to meet the need of contact lens
practitioners and their customers

          cvi also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive
surgical procedures that correct visual defects the company believes that cvi
will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses particularly in markets
where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low
offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share the company
also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales
of contact lenses because each modality serves a different demographic group
contact lens sales are driven by the teenaged market when over 90 of wearers
begin their use refractive surgical procedures are primarily performed on
patients in their late thirties or early forties

csi

          csi focuses on selected segments of the womens healthcare market
supplying high quality diagnostic products surgical instruments and accessories
and in some cases offering all of the products needed for a complete procedure
the market segments in which csi competes continue to be fragmented typified by
smaller technology driven firms that generally offer only one or two product
lines most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some
owned by companies with greater financial resources than cooper competitive
factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances product
quality price customer service and effective communication of product
information to physicians and hospitals csi believes that it competes
successfully against these companies with its


                                       6





page

superior sales and marketing the technological advantages of its products and
by developing new products including those used in new medical procedures in
addition as csi develops products it offers to train medical professionals how
to use them

backlog

          backlog is not a material factor in either of coopers businesses

seasonality

          cvis contact lens sales in the first fiscal quarter which runs from
november 1 through january 31 are typically lower than subsequent quarters as
patient traffic to practitioners offices is relatively light during the holiday
season

compliance with environmental laws

          federal state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of
materials into the environment or relate to the protection of the environment
do not currently materially affect coopers capital expenditures earnings or
competitive position

working capital

          coopers businesses have not required any material working capital
arrangements in the past five years
