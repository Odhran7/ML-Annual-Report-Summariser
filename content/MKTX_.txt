our history 

founded in 2000 marketaxess has a twentyone year history of innovation and leadership in electronic trading for the global credit markets throughout our history our primary commercial goals have remained the same improving trading efficiency and reducing costs for our clients prior to our founding our institutional investor clients were able to trade bonds by telephone with a limited set of brokerdealers with which they had institutional relationships by 2007 our platforms allowed institutional investors to trade electronically with over thirty brokerdealers during the financial crisis we significantly expanded the number of nonprimary and regional dealers providing liquidity on our platforms as many dealers were forced to reduce their balance sheets for market making today we are an sp 500 company that through our open trading protocols provides an expanded liquidity pool for global market participants to trade a wide variety of fixedincome securities with the over 1600 other institutional investor and brokerdealer clients that participated in open trading in 2021 

 

  

our competitive strengths 

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platforms provide access to the liquidity generated by the participation of our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for credit and rates products and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platforms due to the ability to efficiently transact with valuable client order flow and the ability to use our open trading protocols to help manage their risk source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients 

our total credit trading volume increased from approximately 14 trillion in 2017 to 26 trillion in 2021 and our estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume has increased from 169 and 68 respectively in 2017 to 210 and 152 respectively in 2021 

approximately 92 of credit volume on the platform during 2021 was executed by institutional clients 

 

open trading is a differentiator that expands the liquidity pool and further increases costsavings for clients 

in the postfinancial crisis years liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised banks’ capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce marketmaking activities even as the buy side’s bond holdings have grown rapidly in this environment open trading our fully electronic alltoall trading ecosystem has emerged as one solution to the postcrisis liquidity problem as a result open trading participants have broader and more diverse liquidity options compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties the expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers global dealers regional dealers and specialist marketmaking and proprietary trading firms during 2021 over 1660 firms participated in open trading which improved the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches move orders more efficiently and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement 

we believe our open trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading participants to interact with each other thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity available for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response we estimate that liquidity takers saved an estimated 3223 million in transaction costs through open trading during 2021 while liquidity providers saved an estimated 2504 million during the year these open trading cost savings are in addition to the potential cost savings institutional investors can achieve by simultaneously requesting bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients via our traditional disclosed rfq protocol estimated liquidity taker cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and the best disclosed dealer cover price estimated liquidity provider cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and the then current composite bid or offer level offer if the provider is buying bid if the provider is selling at the time of the inquiry in addition dealers use open trading as a source of liquidity to efficiently transfer risk and achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit their credit exposure 

growing comprehensive international offering and client base 

our platforms provide global fixedincome market participants with trading functionality across eurobond and emerging markets rates and credit markets connecting clients in over 80 countries to local and global dealers marketaxess has over 950 active client firms located outside the us that access our platforms through our regulated venues in europe asia and latin america our open trading functionality allows international clients to more efficiently access crossborder liquidity with few regulatory hurdles 

the marketaxess emerging markets trading platform also offers the most comprehensive offering for local currency bond trading across the latin america central  eastern europe middle east and africa and asiapacific “apac” regions our platforms provide clients with the ability to trade emerging market local currency debt denominated in 28 local currencies with over 150 brokerdealers 

in 2021 we extended our global fixedincome trading network to china’s bond market global investor clients are now able to access the china interbank bond market “cibm” via the connection between china foreign exchange trade system “cfets” and marketaxess under the bond connect and cibm direct schemes this arrangement allows clients to trade directly with onshore market makers in china thus broadening access to liquidity in global emerging markets debt 

robust scalable technology throughout the full trading cycle 

we have developed proprietary technology that we believe is highly secure faulttolerant and scalable for substantial growth our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume products and clients with relatively little modification and low incremental costs we have consistently used our proprietary technology to find new ways for our clients to trade more effectively and efficiently our core software solutions span multiple components of the trading lifecycle and include pretrade data and analytics trade execution posttrade data and trade matching regulatory reporting and trade publishing and straightthrough processing our systems are built to be scalable flexible and resilient we have also created new trading protocols and developed additional solutions for our clients that are translated and built by our highly experienced technology and business personnel going forward we expect that our agile software development processes will help us continue to be a market leader in developing the technology solutions for our clients’ trading needs 

in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services throughout the trading cycle in the pretrade period our platforms assist our participants by providing them with valueadded services such as realtime and historical trade price information liquidity and turnover analytics bond reference data and trade order matching alerts following the execution of a trade our platforms support all of the essential tools and functionalities to enable our participants to realize the full benefits of electronic trading and demonstrate best execution including realtime trade details straightthrough processing “stp” account allocations automated audit trails regulatory trade reporting trade detail matching and transaction cost analysis 

 

next generation data and analytical tools supporting the increasing automation of trading workflows 

our data and analytical tools enhance the value proposition of our trading platforms and improve the trading experience of our clients we support our clients’ trading functions by offering valueadded analytics that rely on machinelearning automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients our data and analytical tools are designed to help clients make better trading decisions benefitting our current clients and attracting new market participants to our network for example our composite pricing algorithm powers many of our automated trading solutions which allows traders to automatically execute trades according to predetermined parameters and automatically send completed or rejected order details to internal order management systems by allowing traders to automate and execute their smaller lowtouch trades more efficiently our autoexecution solutions allow traders to focus their attention on higher valueadded trades with a goal of reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors 

our strategy 

our objective is to be the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

increase penetration in credit markets 

we believe that we have a large opportunity remaining in the credit product markets in which we have already established a leadership position for example the estimated average daily trading volume in us highgrade bonds for the year ended december 31 2021 on our platforms was approximately 50 billion representing just 210 of the estimated addressable market of approximately 236 billion the estimated average daily trading volume in us highyield bonds for the year ended december 31 2021 on our platforms was approximately 15 billion representing just 152 of the estimated addressable market of approximately 98 billion our principal competitor in the credit markets in which we have established a leadership position continues to be the traditional methods of bilateral trading including the telephone email or instant messaging we plan to continue to focus on capturing additional market share across our core credit markets 

continue expansion into new product areas 

capitalizing on our experience of building market share in markets like us highgrade and us highyield bonds we are increasing our product footprint in newer product areas including emerging market local currency bonds municipal bonds us government bonds european government bonds and chinese government bonds each of these markets has unique trading protocols market structures and settlement solutions that requires a lengthy rampup period but which will provide diverse revenue sources once significant market share has been achieved for example in 2021 we acquired munibrokers llc “munibrokers” a central electronic trading venue serving municipal bond interdealer brokers and dealers in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution the acquisition connects our leading trading technology with the liquidity of one of the industry’s largest electronic interdealer marketplaces creating a compelling and diverse liquidity solution that we believe will ultimately deliver an improved execution experience 

expand trading protocols and leverage the open trading network 

we believe that we are the only fixedincome electronic trading platform that embraces alltoall trading in each of our product areas open trading exponentially increases the potential trading counterparties by allowing both our brokerdealer clients and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment of the over 1600 firms that participated in open trading in 2021 this unique liquidity solution provided over 5727 million of cost savings to our participants in 2021 our clients executed approximately 21 million credit trades using our open trading solutions during 2021 representing 321 of the total credit trading volume on our platforms we believe that the combination of open trading and our vast client network provides the basis for marketaxess to deliver meaningful crossborder liquidity or enter into new markets where liquidity is scarcer such as municipal bonds 

continue to invest in and grow our business through geographic diversification 

we are continuing to expand and diversify our business internationally our revenues from international clients have grown from 156 of total revenue in 2017 to 192 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients are based in 80 countries we offer liquidity in eurobonds hardcurrency emerging markets products as well as the ability to trade emerging markets debt in 28 global local currencies by offering liquidity in both hardcurrency and local currency emerging market debt on a single trading platform we have created an efficient emerging market trading ecosystem for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in the last five years we have seen significant growth in the europe the middle east and africa “emea” latin america and apac regions the average daily trading volume in the emea latin america and apac regions on the marketaxess platforms has grown from 15 billion in 2017 to 33 billion in 2021 we believe we can increase our penetration in international markets by continuing to invest in creating client relationships abroad thereby creating more revenue opportunities for the company 

 

pursue select acquisitions and strategic alliances 

we continually evaluate opportunities to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that we believe will enable us to enter new markets provide new client segments new products or services or otherwise expand our market share in the fixedincome markets that we operate in today we believe that one of the key drivers of our success to date has been the ability to grow our current product offering for example the acquisition of liquidityedge ® in 2019 provided us with the ability to broaden our rates product offering by entering the us government bond markets with a dealertodealer solution creating a runway for us to expand into other protocols and other rates products like european government bonds in 2020 we acquired the regulatory reporting business of deutsche börse “regulatory reporting hub” in order to expand the footprint of our posttrade and market data services in europe by adding approximately 500 clients across europe in 2021 we acquired munibrokers a central electronic venue serving municipal bond interdealer brokers and dealers in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution together we expect these transactions to accelerate the growth in our rates posttrade and municipal bonds businesses 

the fixedincome products available on our platform 

we operate in a large and rapidly growing market which consists of credit and rates fixedincome products according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” as of september 30 2021 the most recent date available there were approximately 100 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us corporate market an increase of 30 from september 30 2020 during the first nine months of 2021 global longterm new bond issuance aggregated to approximately 24 trillion a decrease of 141 as compared to the same period of 2020 

our proprietary technology allows institutional investor and brokerdealer clients to access this market by trading the credit and rates products on our platforms 

our credit products consist of the following areas 

• us highgrade bonds which refers to us corporate debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s “sp” or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service “moody’s” 

• us highyield bonds which refers to us corporate debt rated lower than bbb by sp or baa3 by moody’s 

• emerging market debt which we define as us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe 

• eurobonds which we define generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe 

• municipal bonds which are debt securities issued by states cities counties and other governmental entities in the us to fund daytoday obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects such as highways or water systems and typically offer interest payments that are exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes and 

• other credit products including leveraged loans which are senior secured commercial facilities provided by a syndicate of lenders for below investmentgrade companies credit rating below bbb or baa3 

our rates products consist of the following areas 

• us government bonds which are government instruments issued by the us department of the treasury 

• agency bonds which are securities issued by a federal government department or by a governmentsponsored enterprise including the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation and 

• other government bonds including european government bonds which are bonds issued by governments of countries in the european union “eu” and noneu european countries as well as bonds issued by other supranational organizations agencies and sovereigns including the european commission 

  

 

the six largest product areas available on our platform by revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 were us highgrade 3011 million us highyield 1405 million emerging market debt 1041 million eurobonds 394 million municipal bonds 150 million and us government bonds 134 million in the chart below we show the average daily trading volume and the amount of new issuance of such product areas for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 except where indicated 

 

  

   

1 for us highgrade and highyield average daily trading volume “adtv” is as measured by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” and amount of new issuance is according to jp morgan markets 

2 for emerging markets debt adtv is as measured by the emerging markets trade association and amount of new issuance is according to jp morgan markets the amount of new issuance excludes debt issued by emerging market sovereigns which are included in our definition of emerging markets debt adtv and amount of new issuance are for the nine months ended september 30 2021 and 2020 the most recent dates available 

3 for eurobonds adtv is according to our internal estimates and amount of new issuance is according to t he international capital markets association  

4 for municipal bonds adtv is as measured by the municipal securities rulemaking board and amount of new issuance is according to sifma 

5 for us government bonds adtv is as measured by sifma and amount of new issuance is according to sifma 

we believe that the current level of electronic trading in our six largest product areas is generally low creating a long runway for future growth for example we estimate that the level of electronic trading as a percentage of all means of trading referred to as “electronic market share” for us highgrade bonds us highyield bonds municipal bonds emerging market debt and eurobonds are approximately 35 20 10 10 and 45 respectively us treasuries are further down the path of electronic trading with an estimated electronic market share at approximately 65 as a comparison based on third party estimates the level of electronic market share for us equity options us exchange traded cash equities and foreign exchange spots are each over 90 

  

 

our full trading lifecycle solutions 

a key principle of our strategy is connecting the most robust network of participants through an advanced full trading lifecycle solution that includes diverse trading protocols intelligent data products and a range of pre and posttrade services in 2021 888 of our revenues were derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms through our diverse trading protocols 55 of our revenues were derived from our integrated and actionable data offerings and 56 of our revenues were derived from our posttrade services 

diverse trading protocols 

disclosed request for quote 

our traditional disclosed rfq protocol allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our dealer clients and execute trades with the dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we are not a party to any of the disclosed rfq trades that occur on our platforms between institutional investor clients and dealer clients rather we serve as a technology intermediary between dealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact directly with each other the disclosed rfq protocol is available for transactions in all of our product areas and can be used for 

• multipledealer inquiries to up to approximately 120 dealers 

• list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on up to 200 bonds at the same time 

• portfolio trading which allows our market participants to transact bond basket trades of up to 1500 securities in an allornone trading protocol with one aggregate price for the portfolio transaction and 

• swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond 

in 2021 679 of all credit volume on the marketaxess platform was executed via a form of our rfq protocol 

open trading 

our open trading protocols complement our disclosed rfq protocol by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an alltoall trading environment of over 1800 potential counterparties open trading participants are able to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation all the way through to settlement unlike our disclosed rfq protocol in connection with our open trading protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades 

we currently offer open trading protocols in us highgrade bonds us highyield bonds eurobonds certain emerging market debt municipal bonds us treasuries agency bonds and other government bonds following the introduction of open trading on our platforms in 2013 we have continued to build upon the technology to develop more features and services for example in 2021 we launched the diversity dealer initiative the “ddi” which leverages the open trading marketplace by allowing institutional investor clients to select minority women and veteranowned brokerdealers to intermediate an open trading transaction while still achieving best execution in addition to the ddi we offer several other open trading protocols including 

• market list rfq which provides our open trading participants with the ability to display requests for bids and offers anonymously to the entire marketaxess trading community thereby creating broad visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increasing the likelihood that the request will result in a completed trade the market list protocol is typically used simultaneously with a disclosed rfq allowing the requestor to achieve best execution by seeking pricing from a participant’s known trading relationships and the open trading marketplace at the same time 

• dealer rfq which allows dealers to initiate rfqs to all other dealers or to the entire open trading network is used by our dealer clients to manage risk source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients dealer rfq is increasingly being used by our dealer clients representing 104 of our credit volume for the year ended december 31 2021 up from 85 for the year ended december 31 2020 

• midx sessions a sessionsbased midpoint matching tool that allows firms to trade against the midpoint price established by composite at a given time instead of bilaterally negotiating a price which we believe removes some of the pricing challenges inherent in other trading protocols 

• live markets an order book functionality that creates a single view of twoway actionable prices for the most active corporate bonds and us treasuries including newly issued debt benchmark issues and newsdriven securities and 

• public axes™ which is an order bookstyle price discovery process that gives clients the ability to view anonymous or disclosed indications of interest from the inventory posted on our platforms 

in 2021 321 of all credit volume on the marketaxess platform was executed via open trading protocols 

  

 

automated trading protocols 

we believe that our automated trading protocols which allow clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders that our platforms will use to determine whether or not to execute a trade in accordance with the predefined parameters reduces trading inefficiencies and human errors while allowing traders to focus on highervalue trades some of our automation tools include 

• autox rfq which allows clients to automatically transact using simple variables such as trade size price and number of respondents and 

• autoresponder which allows clients to automatically respond to requests using either a specified response level or a midpoint price generated by our pricing tool 

in 2021 63 of all credit volume on the marketaxess platform was executed via automated trading protocols 

in addition we offer us treasury hedging which automatically provides a us treasury hedge for trades in credit products available on our platforms 

integrated and actionable data 

data feeds the full trading lifecycle of fixedincome transactions timely and accurate data is particularly important in the fixedincome markets where realtime data has traditionally been scarce and transparency has been limited traders are increasingly using data and machinelearning for pretrade analytics automated execution transaction cost analysis and posttrade solutions our data strategy is centered on using our data offerings to support trading activity through our diverse trading protocols and growing our revenues from our commercial data offerings we believe that our electronic trading platforms allow institutional investors to compile sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual informationgathering process or other electronic services our data products are based on the trading activity and transactions that occur on our platforms 

pricing products 

our composite pricing algorithm generates near realtime prices for approximately 33000 corporate and sovereign bonds based on a variety of data inputs including feeds from our trading platforms our posttrade services and trace composite is used by clients as a pretrade reference price to enhance trading outcomes and transaction cost analysis composite can be combined with our autoexecution service providing clients with an alert if a response is “off market” 

axess all the first intraday trade tape for the european fixedincome market is sourced from approximately 42 000 bond transactions processed daily by our posttrade services business and includes aggregated volume and pricing for the most actively traded european fixedincome instruments we also provide market participants with access to pricing liquidity and volume data on approximately 54 000 unique fixedincome securities and securities reference data for approximately 70000 fixedincome securities 

liquidity products 

we provide order and execution workflow solutions designed to meet the specific needs of the customer liquiditybridge ® is the execution management system that we offer to dealers that allows users to manage and facilitate the complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms including the marketaxess system liquiditybridge brings together realtime comparison and execution of bond prices across multiple sectors allowing users to rapidly react to trading opportunities 

axess iq™ is our order and execution workflow solution designed to meet the needs of the wealth management and private banking community by improving liquidity discovery execution efficiency and alpha generation for firms with large numbers of individual client orders 

relative liquidity score is a product that provides a defined measurement of the current liquidity for individual bonds and highlights the relative potential ease that a trader can expect to transact in such instruments 

analytics products 

bondticker ® provides realtime trace data and enhances it with marketaxess trade data and analytical tools in order to provide professional market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond price information with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available the data includes trade time and sales information including execution prices as well as marketaxessestimated spreadtotreasuries for trades disseminated by the trace system the data also includes actual execution prices and spreadtotreasury levels for us highgrade corporate bond trades executed on the marketaxess platform bondticker is currently the source of corporate bond trading information for the wall street journal in the us 

 

bondticker allows institutional investors to search for and sort bonds based upon specific criteria such as volume timedate of transaction spread change issuer or security this search function allows institutional investors to compile information relating to potential securities trades in a fraction of the time that it takes to manually compile this information from disparate sources or other electronic databases bondticker is integrated directly into the marketaxess electronic trading platform and can be seamlessly accessed either when viewing securities inventory or when launching an inquiry 

posttrade services 

we provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for european investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products in response to the preand posttrade transparency mandates from the recast markets in financial instruments directive “mifid ii” in europe we have been authorized by each of the united kingdom “uk” financial conduct authority “fca” and the netherlands authority for the financial markets “afm” as an approved publication arrangement “apa” and an approved reporting mechanism “arm” in addition to our apa and arm reporting services we have developed a comprehensive suite of valueadd solutions for mifid ii including pretrade transparency services systematic internaliser “si” determination and monitoring best execution reporting commodity position reporting data quality analysis and peer benchmarking 

in the eu and uk all firms regulated as “investment firms” under mifid ii are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction this process is known as transaction reporting firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an arm such as our subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands to validate and submit such reports our multiasset class arm reporting solution allows our clients to report to 20 different european regulators we have also collaborated with equilend on a full fronttoback securities financing transactions regulation “sftr” solution to support mutual clients with their sftr reporting requirements

marketaxess has approximately 960 posttrade reporting and transparency clients including brokerdealers hedge funds and investment banks in 2020 we acquired regulatory reporting hub which has helped us expand and improve our services across a broader european client base predominantly in germany france and the nordics regions 

our clients 

almost 1900 institutional investor and brokerdealer firms are active users of our platforms although institutional investors specialist marketmaking firms proprietary trading firms and other nontraditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platforms through open trading we believe these brokerdealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume following the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security

in order to help our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients meet their esg goals and strategies we have begun to develop esgintegrated product offerings for example in 2019 we launched our “trading for trees” program under which five trees are planted by one tree planted our partner charitable organization for every 1 million of green bond trades executed on our platforms in 2021 511 billion in corporate and municipal green bond trading volume was executed globally on the marketaxess platforms an increase of 893 from 2020 in the us where public data is available marketaxess ranks as the largest electronic corporate and municipal green bond marketplace with an estimated market share of 209 in tracereported corporate and municipal green bond volume 

in addition in 2021 we launched the ddi to enable buy side firms to trade more easily with certain minority women and veteranowned brokerdealers while still achieving best execution the ddi leverages our anonymous alltoall open trading marketplace and provides enhanced trading connections by giving institutional investor clients the option to select a diversity dealer to intermediate an open trading transaction 

sales and marketing 

we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force which works closely with our product management and technology teams is responsible for client acquisition activity and the management of ongoing client relationships our sales team is also responsible for training and supporting new and existing clients on their use of our platforms and posttrade solutions including how to optimize their trading performance and efficiency through our various trading protocols we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing digital and social media promotional mailings and participation in industry conferences and media engagement to increase awareness of our brand our trading platforms and our other solutions for example we work with the wall street journal to leverage bondticker data as the source of information for its weekly distressed debt tables 

seasonality 

our revenue can be impacted by seasonal effects caused by increased levels of new bond issuance which often occurs in the first quarter of a year or slowdowns in trading activity particularly during the customary holiday periods in august and december 

  

 

competition 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we compete with a broad range of market participants globally some of these market participants compete with us in a particular market while select others compete against the entire spectrum of our platforms and solutions we believe our competitive position is enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our clients with our electronic trading platforms and other systems 

we primarily compete on the basis of our client network the liquidity provided by our brokerdealer and to a growing extent our institutional investor clients the total transaction costs associated with our services the breadth of products protocols and services offered  as well as the quality reliability security and ease of use of our platforms we face five main areas of competition 

• bilateral trading — we compete with bond trading business conducted over the telephone email or instant messaging directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients institutional investors have historically purchased fixedincome securities by telephoning or otherwise communicating via email or instant messaging with bond sales professionals at one or more brokerdealers and inquiring about the price and availability of individual bonds this remains the manner in which the majority of corporate bond volumes are still traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

• other multiparty electronic trading platforms — there are numerous other electronic trading platforms currently in existence including several that have only commenced operations in the last few years we compete with tradeweb bloomberg intercontinental exchange trumid and others in the credit and municipal markets and tradeweb bloomberg cme group nex group bgc partners fenics ust and others in the rates markets in addition some brokerdealers and institutional investors operate or have invested in proprietary electronic trading systems or information networks that enable institutional investors to trade directly with a brokerdealer andor with other institutional investors over an electronic medium as we expand our business into new products we will likely come into more direct competition with other electronic trading platforms or firms offering traditional services 

• securities and futures exchanges — in recent years exchanges have pursued acquisitions that have put them in competition with us for example the london stock exchange group acquired a significant stake in tradeweb and intercontinental exchange acquired bondpoint and tmc bonds retailfocused platforms and idc a provider of fixedincome data in an effort to expand its portfolio of fixedincome products and services cme group also operates platforms that compete with us exchanges also have data and analytics businesses which increasingly put their offerings in direct competition with us 

• market data and information vendors — several large market data and information providers such as bloomberg refinitiv intercontinental exchange and ihs markit currently have a data and analytics relationship with virtually every institutional firm some of these entities currently offer varying forms of electronic trading of fixedincome securities some of these entities have announced their intention to expand their electronic trading platforms or to develop new platforms these entities are currently direct competitors to our information services business and already are or may in the future become direct competitors to our electronic trading platforms 

• other approved regulatory reporting businesses — we compete with other approved regulatory mechanisms in europe that have arm and apa designations such as the london stock exchange’s unavista and tradeweb to provide posttrade matching and regulatory transaction reporting and transparency services to european clients 

we face intense competition and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future see part i item 1a – “risk factors — risks related to operating in the electronic fixedincome trading markets — we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance” 

  

 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platforms website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology

we have registered the marketaxess ® name and logo for trademark in the us europe and in other parts of the world we also have a number of other registered or pending trademarks and service marks globally including open trading ®  bondticker ®  and now you’re in the market ® among others in addition we own or have filed applications for the rights to trade names copyrights domain names and service marks that we use in the marketing of products and services to clients 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation in these jurisdictions government regulators and selfregulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business and have broad powers to promulgate and interpret laws rules and regulations that may serve to restrict or limit our business as a matter of public policy these regulators are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations rulemaking by regulators including resulting market structure changes has had an impact on our business by directly affecting our method of operation and at times our profitability 

as registered brokerdealers trading venues and other types of regulated entities as described below certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws rules and regulations including the rules of selfregulatory organizations that cover all aspects of their business including manner of operation system integrity antimoney laundering and financial crimes handling of material nonpublic information safeguarding data capital requirements reporting record retention market access licensing of employees and the conduct of officers employees and other associated persons 

regulation can impose and has imposed obligations on our regulated subsidiaries including our brokerdealer subsidiary these increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices procedures and controls which have increased our costs many of our regulators as well as other governmental authorities are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings examinations inspections and investigations which may result in increased compliance costs penalties fines enhanced oversight increased financial and capital requirements additional restrictions or limitations censure suspension or disqualification of the entity andor its officers employees or other associated persons or other sanctions such as disgorgement restitution or the revocation or limitation of regulatory approvals whether or not resulting in adverse findings regulatory proceedings examinations inspections and investigations can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm’s reputation client relationships and profitability from time to time we and our associated persons have been and are subject to routine reviews none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects as a result of such reviews and any future actions or reviews we may be required to among other things amend certain internal structures and frameworks such as our operating procedures systems and controls 

the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change we are unable to predict how certain new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form or whether any changes to existing laws rules and regulations including the interpretation implementation or enforcement thereof or a relaxation or amendment thereof will occur in the future we believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of certain new rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact although a relaxation of or the amendment of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets while we generally believe the net impact of the laws rules and regulations may be positive for our business it is possible that unintended consequences may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined see part i item 1a – “risk factors – regulatory and legal risks  our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business” 

  

 

us regulation 

in the us the sec is the federal governmental agency primarily responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws including adopting and enforcing rules and regulations applicable to brokerdealers our brokerdealer subsidiary operates an alternative trading system “ats” subject to the sec’s regulation ats which includes certain specific requirements and compliance responsibilities in addition to those faced by brokerdealers generally and an exempt ats for us treasuries brokerdealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business we are also subject to the various antifraud provisions of the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the commodity exchange act certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder we also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers employees and affiliated persons 

the cftc is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal laws governing activities relating to futures swaps and other derivatives including the rules applicable to our sef in 2021 we decided to stop offering credit indices trading and accordingly we suspended our sef’s operations despite the cessation of operations our sef continues to be subject to regulations that relate to trading and product requirements governance and disciplinary requirements operational capabilities surveillance obligations and financial information and resource requirements including the requirement that they maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year our sef continues to be subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the cftc 

much of the regulation of brokerdealers’ operations in the united states has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations these selfregulatory organizations adopt rules which are generally subject to approval by the sec that govern the operations of brokerdealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations in the case of our us brokerdealer subsidiary the principal selfregulatory organization is finra our us brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the sec and finra in addition our brokerdealer’s municipal securitiesrelated activities are subject to the rules of the msrb 

the sec recently conducted a review of the regulatory framework for fixedincome electronic trading platforms for the purpose of evaluating the potential regulatory gaps that may exist among such platforms including ours with respect to access to markets system integrity surveillance and transparency among other things in january 2022 as a result of this review the sec proposed rules that will expand regulation ats and regulation sci to alternative trading systems ats that trade government securities and amend the sec rule regarding the definition of an “exchange” to include communication protocol systems such as our rfq protocols in connection with these proposed rules we expect that we will have to operate all of our trading protocols in compliance with regulation ats it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or what effect such passage adoption or modification will have whether positive or negative on our industry our clients or us 

nonus regulation 

outside of the united states we are currently directly regulated by the financial conduct authority “fca” in the uk de nederlandsche bank “dnb” and the authority for the financial markets “afm” in the netherlands the monetary authority of singapore the “mas” the investment industry regulatory organization of canada the “iiroc” and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil we also hold crossborder licenses or permissions to operate in other jurisdictions with other regulatory bodies including the swiss financial market supervisory authority “finma” the securities  futures commission of hong kong the australian securities and investment commission in australia “asic” the danish financial supervisory authority the german federal financial supervisory authority “bafin” the commission de surveillance du secteur financier of luxembourg the italian commissione nazionale per le società e la borsa “consob” the norwegian financial supervisory authority and the finnish financial supervisory authority 

the fca’s strategic objective is to ensure that the relevant markets function properly and its operational objectives are to protect consumers to protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers it has investigative and enforcement powers derived from the financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma” and subsequent legislation and regulations subject to the fsma individuals or companies that seek to acquire or increase their control in a firm that the fca regulates is required to obtain prior approval from the fca 

the securities industry and financial markets in the 27 member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu regulations provide for a crossborder “passporting regime” which allows us to provide our regulated services throughout the eu in reliance upon our authorization from any eu member state as a result of the uk’s departure from the eu in 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” we obtained afm authorizations for our subsidiaries in the netherlands and we now provide regulated services to our clients within the eu in reliance on the crossborder services passport held by our dutch subsidiaries 

  

 

the legal framework in the netherlands for financial undertakings is predominantly included in the dutch financial supervision act “fsa” the afm like dnb is an autonomous administrative authority with independent responsibility for fulfilling its supervisory function pursuant to the fsa the afm authorizes investment firms the afm is legally responsible for business supervision dnb is responsible for prudential supervision the purpose of prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial undertakings and to contribute to the stability of the financial sector holders of a qualifying holding in short shareholdings or voting rights of 10 or more must apply to the dnb for a declaration of no objection and satisfy the applicable requirements of the fsa 

in january 2018 the eu implemented enhanced rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry including mifid ii and mifir mifid ii and mifir introduced significant changes to the eu financial markets that were designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants by i enhancing pre and posttrade transparency for fixedincome instruments ii increasing and enhancing posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii improving technology synchronization and best execution and iv establishing a consolidated tape for trade data although mifid ii and mifir were intended to help improve the functioning of the eu single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards mifid ii and mifir have caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations has been positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations or future amendments thereto may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined in particular the divergence of the uk from the eu following brexit in relation to the future development of mifid ii and mifir and other rules and regulations within the financial markets such as the central securities depository regulation may further increase the complexity operational costs and compliance requirements of our business in the uk and eu see part i item 1a — “risk factors — regulatory and legal risks  the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects” 

capital requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to jurisdictional specific regulatory capital requirements designed to maintain the general financial integrity and liquidity of a regulated entity in general they require that at least a minimum amount of a regulated entity’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine requirement to cease conducting business suspension revocation of registration or expulsion by the applicable regulatory authorities and ultimately could require the relevant entity’s liquidation 

in addition as a result of our selfclearing activities marketaxess corporation is required to finance certain transactions maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing brokerdealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to rule 15c33 of the exchange act these requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources

 i tem 1a risk factors 

risks related to global economic and market conditions 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

• economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere 

• adverse market conditions including unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading 

• broad trends in business and finance 

• consolidation or contraction in the number of market participants 

• the current or anticipated impact of climate change extreme weather events or natural disasters 

• the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics 

• actual or threatened acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostilities 

• actual or threatened trade war including between the united states and china or other governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or trade policies 

• concerns over inflation and weakening consumer confidence levels 

• the availability of cash for investment by mutual funds exchange traded funds and other wholesale and retail investors 

• the level and volatility of interest rates the difference between the yields on corporate securities being traded and those on related benchmark securities and foreign currency exchange rates 

• the effect of monetary policy adopted by the federal reserve board or foreign banking authorities increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions and other regulatory requirements and political impasses 

• credit availability and other liquidity concerns 

• concerns over credit default or bankruptcy of one or more sovereign nations or corporate entities and 

• legislative and regulatory changes including changes to financial industry regulations and tax laws 

there have been significant declines in trading volumes in the financial markets generally in the past and there may be similar declines in trading volumes generally or across our platforms in particular in the future any one or more of the above factors may contribute to reduced trading volumes our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions low volatility or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas our business operations have historically been substantially located in the us and the uk due to the concentration of our operations in the us and uk we are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors 

  

 

our business has been and our results of operations and financial condition may be impacted by the outbreak of and global response to the pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse 

the global spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has created significant volatility in the markets we serve and has increased uncertainty and economic disruption the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business operations and financial results is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including 

• the duration and scope of the pandemic and the effects of new variants 

• governmental and business actions taken in response to the pandemic and in response to economic disruption and the impact of those actions on global economic activity 

• the impact of the economic and business disruptions on the trading needs of our clients and the resulting impact on their demand for our electronic trading platforms and solutions 

• adverse market conditions including unforeseen market closures disruptions in trading significant declines in market and trading volumes credit availability and other liquidity concerns and 

• our ability to provide our electronic trading platforms and other solutions including as a result of our employees health or our employees or our clients’ employees working remotely andor closures of offices and facilities 

as a result of the pandemic the global economy has been experiencing a period of significant turmoil and we have experienced significant changes in our daily operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical factors affecting our industry and our company— economic political and market factors ” due to the uncertainty of the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the uncertainty as to what additional governmental measures may yet be taken in response to the pandemic and the unpredictable effect on our business our employees and our clients we are not able to reasonably estimate the extent of any potential future impact of the pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations but the impact could be material even after the pandemic has subsided our business may continue to be impacted as a result of the pandemic’s global economic impact further our operating and financial results may be affected in a manner that is not presently known to us or in a manner that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations given the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the pandemic 

our operations businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by climate change and we are subject to other esg risks that could adversely affect our reputation 

there is increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters including floods wildfires hurricanes and tornados any of our primary locations or those of third parties on which we rely may be vulnerable to such adverse physical effects of climate change which could result in risk of loss incurred as a result of physical damage power outages or business interruption caused by such events 

in addition governments investors employees customers and the general public are increasingly focused on esg practices and disclosures for example certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies’ responses to climate change and other esg matters as part of their investment theses and policies our reputation could be adversely impacted by our sustainability practices and esg disclosures or investor perceptions thereof including if we fail to establish measurable environmental goals or subsequently fail to meet any such goals any negative publicity we receive regarding esg low esg scores or ratings or shifts in investing priorities may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock or our business operations and earnings if investors employees customers or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed esg matters in addition if the company does not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fails to meet the esg goals under its strategy or evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and standards or if the company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for esg issues these or other climate changes could lead to increased operating costs or capital expenses 

  

 

risks related to operating in the electronic fixedincome trading markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platforms would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platforms and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platforms and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as “block trades” the level of credit spreads and credit volatility and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment 

a decline in overall market volumes trading volumes on our platforms or our platforms’ market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industry in which we operate is rapidly evolving if we are unable to adapt our business effectively to keep pace with industry changes we may not be able to compete effectively which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the electronic financial services industry is characterized by rapidly changing and increasingly complex technologies and systems changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands including access to new technologies functionalities and markets frequent technology and service introductions evolving industry standards changing regulatory requirements and new business models if we are not able to keep pace with changing market conditions or client demands and if our competitors release new functionality or technology before we do our existing platforms solutions and technologies may become obsolete or our competitive position may be materially harmed each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations operating in a rapidly evolving industry involves a high degree of risk and our future success depends in part on our ability to 

• attract and retain market participants on our platforms on a costeffective basis 

• expand and enhance reliable and costeffective product and service offerings for our clients 

• develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platforms 

• respond effectively to competitive pressures 

• respond effectively to the loss of any of our significant brokerdealer or institutional investor clients including due to merger consolidation bankruptcy liquidation or other cause including among other things the collection of any amounts due from such clients 

• operate support expand and develop our operations technology website software communications and other systems 

• defend our trading platforms and other systems from cybersecurity threats and 

• respond to regulatory changes or demands 

if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future within our markets we compete based on our ability to provide our clients with deep liquidity a broad network of market participants a wide range of products and protocols and comprehensive pretrade trade and posttrade functionality as well as the reliability security and ease of use of our electronic platforms and solutions among other factors we primarily compete with other electronic trading platforms and trading businesses conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone email or instant messaging our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 1 other multiparty electronic trading platforms 2 securities and futures exchanges 3 market data and information vendors 4 technology software and information services or other companies that have existing commercial relationships with brokerdealers or institutional investors and 5 other approved regulatory reporting businesses 

 

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified due to consolidation which has resulted in increasingly large and sophisticated competitors in recent years our competitors have made acquisitions andor entered into joint ventures and consortia to improve the competitiveness of their electronic trading offerings if as a result of industry consolidation our competitors are able to offer lower cost andor a wider range of trading venues and solutions obtain more favorable terms from thirdparty providers or otherwise take actions that could increase their market share our competitive position and therefore our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our operations also include the sale of pre and posttrade services analytics and market data there is a high degree of competition among market data and information vendors in solutions for pre and posttrade data analytics and reporting and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge some of these companies are already in or may enter the electronic trading business accordingly some of our competitors may be able to combine use of their electronic trading platforms with complementary access to market data and analytical tools andor leverage relationships with existing clients to obtain additional business from such clients which could preempt use of our platforms or solutions for example bloomberg refinitiv and intercontinental exchange own trading platforms that compete with ours and also have a data and analytics relationships with the vast majority of institutional wholesale and retail market participants if we are not able to compete successfully in this area in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to potential reputational and credibility concerns related to our data products and index business 

we have announced our intention to enter into the index business to the extent that any of our data or index business or the company as a whole suffers a reputational or other loss in credibility it could have a material adverse impact on our business real or perceived factors that may affect credibility include the appearance of a conflict of interest the independence of our index composition the influence of third parties on our decisions the performance of companies relative to their index inclusion the timing and nature of changes to our indexes disagreement with our methodologies or models including for calculating indexes as well as our data information and analysis and the accuracy and completeness of our data information and analytics damage to our reputation brand or credibility could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to our future levels of business profitability and growth 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of market participants that use our electronic trading platforms our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platforms by these participants for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platforms we cannot assure you that the growth rates for the use of our electronic trading services that we have experienced in recent years will continue 

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 431 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability in recent years we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platforms or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platforms or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platforms consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platforms to enter new markets including new asset classes products and geographies including markets where we have little or no operating experience we may have difficulties identifying and entering into new markets due to established competitors lack of recognition of our brand and lack of acceptance of our platforms and solutions as has occurred with certain of our initiatives in the past 

expansion particularly in new geographic markets may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time in particular we may need to make additional investments in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems furthermore our expansion efforts may divert management’s attention or inefficiently utilize our resources if we are not able to manage our expansion effectively our expansion costs could increase at a faster rate than our revenues from these new markets if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage our expansion our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in any new markets even if we do adapt our products services and technologies we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients to our platforms and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 

we may face increasing challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate electronic trading platforms in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platforms and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets these risks include 

• difficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for planned expansion if at all and the possibility that any approvals that are obtained may impose restrictions on the operation of our business 

• the inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving and subject to unexpected change 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations including as a result of brexit our access to and our ability to compete for and hire skilled employees in both the uk and the eu 

• less developed technological infrastructures and generally higher costs which could result in lower client acceptance of our services or clients having difficulty accessing our trading platforms 

• fluctuations in exchange rates 

• reduced or no protection for intellectual property rights 

• seasonal reductions in business activity and 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 

risks related to our customer concentration 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platforms by posting prices for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platforms would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results over the past several years there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries and several of our large brokerdealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome products further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platforms which could in turn reduce the use of our platforms by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platforms and increasingly to provide liquidity through our open trading protocols a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients also buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone email and instant messaging and through other electronic trading platforms 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit and operational risks 

we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary 

in connection with our anonymous trading protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled by us or through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to the clients on our platforms including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platforms clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our platforms although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our anonymous trading participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us 

 

we have policies procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk though there can be no assurance that they will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixedincome markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

selfclearing exposes us to significant operational liquidity financing and regulatory risks 

we selfclear substantially all of our bond transactions for our us operations and we may expand selfclearing to certain of our foreign operations in the future selfclearing requires us to finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations selfclearing exposes our business to operational risks including business and technology disruption operational inefficiencies liquidity financing and regulatory risks and potentially increased expenses in connection with our conversion to selfclearing for our us operations in 2020 we experienced operational inefficiencies and technology issues which in combination with the capital and liquidity requirements that are imposed on all new selfclearing members resulted in increased fail rates in the immediate period following the conversion although the initial conversion issues for our us clearing operations have been resolved in the future we may encounter difficulties with selfclearing that lead to operating inefficiencies technology issues dissatisfaction amongst our client base disruption in the infrastructure that supports the business inadequate liquidity increased margin requirements with clearing organizations and thirdparty settlement agents who provide financing with respect to transactions reductions in available borrowing capacity and financial loss any such delay disruption expense or failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk moreover any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

technology it systems and cybersecurity risks 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences constant competition and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platforms may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 1 enhance our existing products and services 2 develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients 3 continue to attract highlyskilled technology personnel and 4 respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis 

developing our electronic trading platforms and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platforms information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry or regulatory standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our clients may forego the use of our platforms and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking cloud telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry or regulatory standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our bond reference databases the clearing and settlement of our open trading transactions and to provide the technology underpinning key portions of our marketaxess rates platform we obtain essential reference data and information services from external sources including data received from certain competitors clients selfregulatory organizations and other thirdparty data providers our reference data sources and information providers could increase the price for or withdraw their data or information services for a variety of reasons further as has occurred in the past our competitors could revise the current terms on which they provide us with data or information services or could cease providing us with data or information services altogether for a variety of reasons including competition disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide technology services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud computing and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platforms systems and infrastructure 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platforms for our clients if our trading platforms cannot cope or expand to cope with demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience disruptions in service slow delivery times and insufficient capacity these consequences could result in our clients deciding to stop using or reduce their use of our platforms which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platforms technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platforms to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

systems failures interruptions delays in service catastrophic events and resulting interruptions in the availability of our trading platforms could materially harm our business and reputation 

our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our trading platforms systems networks and infrastructure we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty providers will not experience systems failures or business interruptions as has occurred in the past our systems networks infrastructure and other operations in particular our trading platforms are vulnerable to impact or interruption from a wide variety of causes including irregular or heavy use of our trading platforms during peak trading times or at times of increased market volatility power internet or telecommunications failures hardware failures or software errors human error acts of vandalism or sabotage catastrophic events including those that are occurring with increasing frequency due to climate change such as natural disasters and extreme weather events acts of war or terrorism malicious cyberattacks or cyber incidents such as unauthorized access ransomware loss or destruction of data computer viruses or other malicious code and the loss or failure of systems over which we have no control such as loss of support services from critical thirdparty providers in addition we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity andor increased costs associated with such usage 

 

failures of or significant interruptions delays or disruptions to or security breaches affecting our systems networks or infrastructure have in the past and could in the future result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our platforms we internally support and maintain many of our systems and networks including those underlying our trading platforms however we may not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all systems networks or infrastructure problems our failure to monitor or maintain our systems networks and infrastructure including those maintained or supported by our thirdparty providers or to find a replacement for defective or obsolete components within our systems networks and infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we generally have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices for much of our business including redundant systems networks computer software and hardware and data centers to address interruption to our normal course of business our systems networks and infrastructure may not always be fully redundant and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be sufficient or effective similarly although some contracts with our thirdparty providers such as our hosting facility providers require adequate disaster recovery or business continuity capabilities we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation if we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans or if our plans prove insufficient for a particular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

if we experience design defects errors failures or delays with our platforms products or services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms our business could suffer serious harm 

our platforms products and services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms may and have from time to time contained design defects and errors when first introduced or when new updates or enhancements are released in our development of new protocols platform features and updates and enhancements to our existing platforms products and services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms we may make a design error that causes the platform protocol or feature to operate incorrectly or less effectively many of our protocols also rely on data and services provided by thirdparty providers over which we have limited or no control and may be provided to us with defects errors or failures our clients may also use our platforms products or services together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 

if design defects errors or failures are discovered in our current or future platforms or protocols we may not be able to correct or work around them in a costeffective or timely manner or at all the existence of design defects errors failures or delays that are significant or are perceived to be significant could also result in rejection or delay in market acceptance of our platforms or protocols damage to our reputation loss of clients and related revenues diversion of resources product liability claims regulatory actions or increases in costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

malicious cyberattacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties 

the operation of our electronic trading platforms relies on the secure processing storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data including confidential client and personal information our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential and personal customer information ransomware unavailability or disruption of service computer viruses acts of vandalism or other malicious code cyberattack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact despite the defensive measures we have taken we are and will continue to be subject to attacks which may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

 

our business also depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our platforms systems networks and infrastructure any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to our systems networks or infrastructure due to a ransomware attack or other cyberattack could result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the thirdparty service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and trading system software network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyberattack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure in addition despite the reopening of our offices the increased flexibility for our employees to continue to work remotely has amplified certain risks related to among other things the increased demand on our information technology resources and systems the increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks and the increased number of points of possible attack such as laptops and mobile devices both of which are now being used in increased numbers to be secured any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our trading platform 

there have been an increasing number of cyberattacks in recent years in various industries including ours and cybersecurity risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats including the assessment of firms’ vulnerability to cyberattacks in particular regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies practices and procedures protecting firm networks and information identifying and addressing risks associated with clients vendors and other third parties preventing and detecting unauthorized activities adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions 

our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyberattack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platforms we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage pay a ransom protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws regulations and obligations could harm our business 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations in countries where we do business for example the eu adopted the general data protection regulations “gdpr” which requires entities both in the european economic area and outside to comply with new regulations regarding the handling of personal data brexit has created additional uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection as the uk now has its own data protection laws which are separate from the eu gdpr we are also subject to certain us federal state and foreign laws governing the protection of personal privacy and data in those jurisdictions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number in addition to the increased cost of compliance our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the gdpr and other laws and regulations relating to personal data could result in substantial financial penalties for noncompliance expose us to litigation risk and could result in significant liability increased costs or cause our clients to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business  

  

 

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future functionalities products or services this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if our efforts to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our technology pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend make it more difficult to operate or prevent us from operating our business or portions of our business and result in significant monetary liability 

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us as they have done in the past with respect to our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to possible transactions or investments 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies and are unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions or any strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures which we may enter into 

from time to time we may pursue acquisitions which may not be completed or if completed may not be as beneficial to us as expected we have made acquisitions in the past including the purchases of liquidityedge in 2019 the regulatory reporting business of deutsche börse in 2020 and munibrokers in 2021 we also may consider potential divestitures of businesses from time to time we routinely evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis however even if we execute a definitive agreement there can be no assurance that we will consummate the transaction within the anticipated closing timeframe or at all moreover there is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in the electronic financial services industry 

  

 

if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

• we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy or that we overpaid for the company or assets or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision may change 

• we may have difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing electronic trading platforms products and services 

• we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or retaining the key personnel of the acquired business 

• there may be client confusion if our services overlap with those of the acquired company and we may have difficulty retaining key customers vendors and other business partners of the acquired business 

• our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises 

• we may enter into markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors hold stronger market positions 

• potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or product and 

• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition including but not limited to claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties 

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

we may also enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures as a means to accelerate our entry into new markets provide new solutions or enhance our existing capabilities entering into strategic alliances partnerships and joint ventures entails risks including i difficulties in developing or expanding the business of newly formed alliances partnerships and joint ventures ii exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest iii potential conflicts with or among our partners iv the possibility that our partners could take action without our approval or prevent us from taking action and v the possibility that our partners become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations 

  

 

risks related to key personnel and employees 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel although we have invested in succession plans and we have shortterm contingency plans in place any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel especially software developers has become increasingly competitive in our talent markets many companies including both our competitors and firms outside of our industry are interested in hiring our experienced personnel additionally highly innovative technology firms both in and outside our traditional geographic markets may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel through remote work opportunities many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory and legal risks 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the uk the afm in the netherlands the monetary authority of singapore the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition our regulatory reporting business is registered as an arm and apa with the fca and the afm we also hold several crossborder licenses and permissions with various other regulatory bodies see part i item 1 “business – government regulation – nonus regulation” 

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations most aspects of our brokerdealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including the way we deal with our clients our capital requirements our financial and regulatory reporting practices required recordkeeping and record retention procedures the licensing of our employees and the conduct of our directors officers employees and affiliates 

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered brokerdealer and mtf are subject to us or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from us or our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation despite our decision to suspend its operations continues to be registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

 

our ability to operate our platforms in a jurisdiction may be dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems 

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely or costeffective basis or at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to be curtailed or become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see part 1 item 1 “business—government regulation” 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body 

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business 

our business and the business of many of our clients is subject to extensive regulation governmental and regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may promulgate new or revised or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing rules and regulations at any time in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business any such changes in laws rules or regulations or in governmental policies could create additional regulatory exposure for our business cause us to incur significant additional costs require us to change or cease aspects of our business or restrict or limit our ability to grow our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there have been in the past and could be in the future significant technological operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations that derive from compliance with evolving laws rules and regulations 

we cannot predict whether additional changes to the laws rules and regulations that govern our business and operations including changes to their interpretation implementation or enforcement will occur in the future or the extent to which any such changes will impact our business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for example the sec recently proposed rules that will expand regulation ats and regulation sci to alternative trading systems ats that trade government securities and amend the sec rule regarding the definition of an “exchange” to include communication protocol systems such as our rfq protocols in connection with these proposed rules we expect that we will have to operate all of our trading protocols in compliance with regulation ats the fixed income industry has also been grappling with how to comply with rule 15c211 “publication or submission of quotations without specified information” of the securities exchange act which had not previously been applied to debt securities we cannot predict how current proposals that have not yet been finalized andor that remain subject to ongoing debate will be implemented or in what form further we andor our clients could become subject to future legislation and regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed adopted or contemplated in the us or abroad additionally unintended consequences of such new laws rules and regulations may adversely affect our industry our clients and us in ways yet to be determined any such legal and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the exit of the uk has increased the complexity and cost of conducting business in both the eu and the uk and introduces significant new barriers to crossborder trading including uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject we historically conducted business in europe primarily through the “passporting rights” of our uk subsidiaries which were eliminated as a result of brexit following brexit we have new regulatory and operational costs and challenges associated with the operation of our regulated subsidiaries in the netherlands which we use to provide our trading platforms and certain posttrade services to our clients in the eu in addition as a result of brexit t he eu regulatory authorities may enact regulatory changes that may affect our business by creating further market fragmentation  

 

brexit has led to a growing divergence between the uk and eu financial regulations which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject in addition the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes has required us to make changes to the technology underlying our trading platforms and regulatory reporting systems in the uk and eu which has resulted in new regulatory and operational costs and challenges 

although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of the exit of the uk from the eu any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties 

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations 

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients have in the past and may in the future make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures failure to protect their confidential or personal information mismanagement or even fraud in connection with our entry into the index business we may face with claims related to errors in our methodology or models used to calculate the indices we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and the services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

liquidity and funding risks 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements the growth of our open trading protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business as a result of our selfclearing activities we are also required to finance certain transactions maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing brokerdealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to rule 15c33 of the exchange act although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 1 support more rapid growth of our business 2 finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations 3 acquire complementary companies or technologies 4 increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support our operations or 5 respond to unanticipated or changing capital requirements 

in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us 

all or part of any debt financing could be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreements with third party lenders which include restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 5000 million subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 2500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things may restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants may restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 

• incur or guarantee additional debt 

• create or incur liens 

• change our line of business 

• sell or transfer assets 

• make certain investments or acquisitions 

• pay dividends or distributions redeem or repurchase our equity or make certain other restricted payments 

• consummate a merger or consolidation 

• enter into certain swap derivative or similar transactions 

• enter into certain transactions with affiliates and 

• incur restrictions on our ability to grant liens or in the case of subsidiaries pay dividends or other distributions 

we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio a minimum regulatory net capital balance for certain subsidiaries and a minimum consolidated adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lenders under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lenders would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

the global economic and credit market environments during the year ended december 31 2021 were markedly different as compared to 2020 during 2020 the global economy experienced a period of significant turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions due to the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the “pandemic” the steep drop in economic activity in 2020 impacted global credit markets and resulted in sharp credit spread widening and an increase in credit market volumes during 2021 however the improving economic conditions resulted in lower volatility credit spreads tightening to historical lows for a prolonged period of time a rising interest rate environment and a decline in us credit market volumes in the year ended december 31 2021 market volumes in us highgrade and us highyield corporate bonds as reported by trace decreased 69 and 74 respectively compared to the year ended december 31 2020 turnover which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding in us highgrade bonds remains below the precredit crisis levels we believe that the benign credit market conditions in 2021 negatively impacted trading velocity and the volumes traded on our platforms 

as a result of the pandemic we have continued to experience significant changes in our daily operations in midmarch 2020 we successfully implemented a global work from home mandate for all our employees and we were able to continue to provide our trading platforms and other services to our clients without interruption in particular we believe that open trading liquidity was essential to the functioning of credit markets during the pandemic and marketaxess played a valuable role keeping our clients connected to the market as traders moved from their centralized trading floors to home offices we reopened our primary offices in the fourth quarter of 2021 with an emphasis on safety and employee wellbeing while our offices remained open through the omicron variant surge in new york london and elsewhere we encouraged our employees to work from home when possible we remain confident that we can continue to maintain business continuity and serve our clients in a virtual or hybrid environment as necessary to promote employee and public safety 

there has been increased demand for green bonds and other esglinked securities in the fixed income markets in which we operate based on the interest we are receiving from investors we expected such increased demand to continue 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

we expect that current cash and investment balances in combination with cash flows that are generated from operations and the ability to borrow under our 2021 credit agreement as defined below will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet no borrowings under our 2021 credit agreement and with capital significantly in excess of our regulatory requirements 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer or alltoall trading platforms competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us 

we primarily compete on the basis of our client network the liquidity provided by our dealer and to a growing extent institutional investor clients the total transaction costs associated with our services the breadth of products protocols and services offered  as well as the quality reliability security and ease of use of our platforms  we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the unique liquidity provided by our open trading functionalities and the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

regulatory environment 

our business is subject to extensive regulations in the united states and internationally which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause additional legal costs to ensure compliance the existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended resulting in the enactment and enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business for example the sec recently proposed rules that will expand regulation ats and regulation sci to alternative trading systems ats that trade government securities and amend the sec rule regarding the definition of an “exchange” to include communication protocol systems such as our rfq protocols in connection with these proposed rules we expect that we will have to operate all of our trading protocols in compliance with regulation ats the fixedincome industry has also been grappling with how to comply with rule 15c211 “publication or submission of quotations without specified information” of the securities exchange act which had not previously been applied to debt securities the impact of any of these reform efforts on us and our operations remains uncertain 

as a result of brexit we obtained authorizations from the afm for our subsidiaries in the netherlands in 2019 we now provide regulated services to our clients within the eu in reliance on the crossborder services passport held by our dutch subsidiaries brexit has led to an ongoing divergence between the uk and eu financial regulations which has made it more difficult and costly to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes has increased and is likely to continue to increase in the future 

compliance with regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources which may adversely affect our profitability however we believe new regulations may also increase demand for our platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic platforms that meet the various regulatory requirements and help them comply with their regulatory obligations 

for further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see part 1 item 1 “business—government regulation” 

technology environment 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure initiatives and continually improve our platforms to further enhance our leading market position we expect that our agile software development processes will help us continue to be a market leader in developing the technology solutions for our clients’ trading needs 

as the overall share of electronic trading grows in global credit products we are experiencing continued demand for and growth in our automated trading solutions automated trading volumes rose to 1672 billion in 2021 up 327 from 1260 billion in 2020 in addition the use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on our platforms with approximately 184 million algorithmic responses in 2021 up 291 from the prior year 

we experience cyberattacks and attempted data security breaches cybersecurity incidents could impact revenue and operating income and increase costs we therefore continue to make investments in our cybersecurity infrastructure and training of employees which may result in increased costs to strengthen our cybersecurity measures 

see also part 1 item 1a  “risk factors technology it systems and cybersecurity risks” 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platforms and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

• the number of participants on our platforms and their willingness to use our platforms instead of competitors platforms or execution methods 

• the frequency and competitiveness of the price responses by participants on our platforms 

• the number of markets that are available for our clients to trade on our platforms 

• the overall level of activity in these markets and 

• the level of commissions that we collect for trades executed through the platforms 

 

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

as further described under “— critical factors affecting our industry and our company — economic political and market factors” and “— critical factors affecting our industry and our company — competitive landscape” our trading volume growth rate slowed in 2021 

commission revenue 

commissions are recognized on a trade date basis are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded as well as individual client incentives bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

for open trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades for us treasury matched principal trades commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain brokerdealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platforms distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

other credit commissions other credit includes eurobonds emerging markets bonds highyield bonds municipal bonds and leveraged loans commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules our highyield fee plan structure is similar to our us highgrade fee plans certain dealers participate in a highyield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments other credit distribution fees include subscription revenues associated with the munibrokers platform the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

rates commissions rates includes us treasury us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for rates products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded us treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol the average rates fee per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

information services 

we generate revenue from data licensed to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers professional and consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services these revenues are either for subscriptionbased services transferred over time and may be net of volumebased discounts or onetime services revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided customers are generally billed monthly quarterly or annually revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 

posttrade services 

we generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting trade publication and trade matching services customers are generally billed in the current month or monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period we also generate onetime implementation fees for onboarding clients which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is complete 

 

other revenue 

other revenue includes revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients 

expenses

critical accounting estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions critical accounting estimates for us include stockbased compensation and contingent consideration payable 

stockbased compensation 

we maintain a stock incentive plan which provides for the grant of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock performance shares performance units restricted stock units performance stock units or other stockbased awards as incentives and rewards to encourage employees consultants and nonemployee directors we make critical accounting estimates related to performance shares and performance stock units 

in january 2020 annual performance share awards “psas” and in january 2021 performance stock units together with the psas “performance equity awards” were granted to the executive officers and certain senior managers each performance equity award granted in january 2020 and january 2021 is earned or forfeited based on our level of achievement of certain predetermined metrics including pretax adjusted operating income and market share the vested share payout ranges from zero to 150 for the awards issued in january 2020 and zero to 200 for the awards issued in january 2021 of the performance equity award target the number of performance equity awards that vest if any will be determined by the level of achievement of the performance metrics during the threeyear performance periods as certified by the board following the conclusion of the performance period in addition participants must provide continued service through the vesting date subject to death disability and in the case of the awards issued in january 2021 qualified retirement exceptions compensation expense for performance equity awards is measured using the fair value of our stock at the grant date and estimates of future performance and actual share payouts each period we make estimates of the current expected share payout and adjust the lifetodate compensation expense recognized since the grant date as of december 31 2021 a 10 change in the expected final share payout would increase or decrease the lifetodate compensation expense by 10 million refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to changes in final share payout expectations 

contingent consideration payable 

in connection with our acquisitions of munibrokers and regulatory reporting hub we recognized contingent consideration payables of up to 496 million with payment dates ranging from 1824 months from the acquisition dates these contingent consideration payables are classified as level 3 liabilities in the fair value hierarchy and are valued using unobservable inputs and estimates of various factors including client retention rates electronic order flow levels future license fees we earn and discount rates changes in these estimates or the final figures on the payment dates could have a material impact on the contingent consideration payable liabilities we record on our balance sheet for example as of december 31 2021 a 10 change in the projected annual subscription and license fees would increase or decrease the expected contingent consideration payable by approximately 20 million refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the changes in contingent consideration payable during the year ended december 31 2021 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

segment results 

we operate electronic platforms for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services the financial markets in which we compete and our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for certain geographic information about our business required by us gaap

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past two years we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand internally generated funds and shortterm borrowings cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled 5428 million at december 31 2021 our investments are generally invested in us treasury securities we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes 

in october 2021 we entered into a new threeyear revolving credit facility the “2021 credit agreement” provided by a syndicate of lenders and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent that provides aggregate commitments totaling 5000 million consisting of a revolving credit facility and a 50 million letter of credit sublimit for standby letters of credit the 2021 credit agreement replaced our credit agreement entered into in november 2020 the “2020 credit agreement” and will mature on october 15 2024 with our option to request up to two additional 364day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary conditions the 2020 credit agreement also provided aggregate commitments totaling 5000 million as of december 31 2021 we had 10 million in letters of credit outstanding and 4990 million in available borrowing capacity under the 2021 credit agreement the 2021 credit agreement requires that we satisfy certain covenants which include a leverage ratio we were in compliance with all applicable covenants at december 31 2021 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the 2020 credit agreement and the 2021 credit agreement 

in connection with its selfclearing operations our us brokerdealer subsidiary entered into an agreement the “collateralized agreement” with its settlement bank to provide loans up to an aggregate of 2000 million on an uncommitted basis borrowings under the collateralized agreement are collateralized by securities pledged by the brokerdealer subsidiary to the settlement bank subject to applicable haircuts and concentration limits as of december 31 2021 the brokerdealer subsidiary had no borrowings outstanding and 2000 million in available borrowing capacity under the collateralized agreement see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the collateralized agreement 

under arrangements with their settlement banks certain of our us and uk operating subsidiaries may receive overnight financing in the form of bank overdrafts as of december 31 2021 we had no overdrafts payable outstanding 

as a result of our selfclearing and settlement activities we are required to finance certain transactions maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing brokerdealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to rule 15c33 of the exchange act as of december 31 2021 the aggregate amount of the positions financed deposits and customer reserve balances associated with our selfclearing and settlement activities was 2260 million these requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources 

during the past two years our cash flows were as follows 

 cash flows for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

the 1224 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreases in net sales and maturities of trading investments of 735 million net income of 415 million net receivables from brokerdealers clearing organizations and customers of 114 million and deferred taxes of 70 million offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of 175 million and a decrease in accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities of 58 million 

the 1366 million decrease in net cash provided by used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities availableforsale of 1378 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 50 million offset by lower cash used for acquisitions of 62 million 

the 447 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to increases in repurchases of our common stock of 471 million and cash dividends paid on common stock of 92 million offset by decreases in exercises of stock options of 31 million and withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 85 million 

 

past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity business and financial condition 

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and requirements including commitments for capital expenditures in the shortterm during the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including liquidity requirements associated with our selfclearing operations and expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business in addition in the longterm beyond 12 months we believe our liquidity needs and requirements will be affected by the factors enumerated above 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the fca in the uk or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2021 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2021 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 5612 million in excess of the required levels of 220 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator as of december 31 2021 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 3036 million 

we execute bond transactions between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades our us brokerdealer subsidiary operates under a selfclearing model for the settlement of such transactions our subsidiaries also settle their transactions through thirdparty clearing brokers or settlement agents settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded under both the selfclearing and the thirdparty clearing models we may be exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is an error in executing a matched principal transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements each thirdparty clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of our trades we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 substantially all our open securities failedtodeliver and securities failedtoreceive transactions as of december 31 2021 have subsequently settled at the contractual amounts 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and indemnification provisions our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

in january 2019 our board authorized a twoyear share repurchase program for up to 1000 million that commenced in april 2019 and expired on march 31 2021 in january 2021 our board authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 1000 million that commenced on april 1 2021 and was exhausted in january 2022 in january 2022 our board authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 1500 million we expect repurchases under the new program to commence in the first quarter of 2022 shares repurchased under each program will be held in treasury for future use 

on november 30 2020 we acquired regulatory services gmbh the paneuropean regulatory reporting business of deutsche börse group the purchase price consists of 225 million in cash paid at closing and up to 246 million in contingent consideration payable in cash within 18 months of the closing on april 9 2021 we acquired munibrokers a central electronic venue serving municipal bond brokers and dealers the purchase price consists of 171 million in cash paid at closing and up to 250 million in contingent consideration payable in cash within approximately two years of the closing 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy 

  

 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures called earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failedtodeliver and securities failedtoreceive from brokerdealers clearing organizations and customers less expenditures for furniture equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs we believe these nongaap financial measures when taken into consideration with the corresponding gaap financial measures are important in understanding our operating results ebitda and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity we believe that ebitda and free cash flow provide useful additional information concerning profitability of our operations and business trends and the cash flow available to pay dividends repurchase stock and meet working capital requirements 

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net income to ebitda as defined for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2021 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 

   

  

 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had 249 million of investments in us treasuries that were classified as trading securities adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also part 1 item 1a  – “risk factors – risks related to global economic and market conditions – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2021 our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to 5428 million a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual investment income by approximately 05 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we conduct operations in several different countries outside of the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in nonus dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 170 of our revenue and 312 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the british pound sterling based on actual results over the past year a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 118 million and operating expenses by approximately 112 million 

credit risk 

through certain of our subsidiaries we execute bond transactions between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades our us brokerdealer subsidiary operates under a selfclearing model for the settlement of such transactions our subsidiaries also settle their transactions through thirdparty clearing brokers or settlement agents settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

  

 

we have policies procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk there can be no assurance that these policies procedures and automated controls will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixedincome markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at three major global banks given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at these banks

we are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platforms between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact directly with each other however in connection with our open trading and other anonymous protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades in 2020 327 of all credit volume on the marketaxess platform was executed via open trading protocols up from 263 in 2019

 

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 985  of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 864  of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2020  although institutional investors specialist marketmaking firms proprietary trading firms and other nontraditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platform s through open trading we believe these brokerdealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume following the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security 

in 2020 our volume in us highgrade and high yield corporate bonds represented approximately 216 and 146 respectively of the total estimated us highgrade and high yield corporate bond volumes as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

we provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for european investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products in response to the preand posttrade transparency mandates from the recast markets in financial instruments directive “mifid ii” in europe we have been authorized by each of the united kingdom “uk” financial conduct authority “fca” and the netherlands authority for the financial markets “afm” as an approved publication arrangement “apa” and an approved reporting mechanism “arm” in addition to our apa and arm reporting services we have developed a comprehensive suite of valueadd solutions for mifid ii including pretrade transparency services systematic internaliser “si” determination and monitoring best execution reporting commodity position reporting data quality analysis and peer benchmarking

in 2020 921 of our revenues were derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms we also derive revenues from information services posttrade services and other income our revenue can be impacted by seasonal effects caused by increased levels of new bond issuance which often occurs in the first quarter of a year or slowdowns in trading activity particularly during the customary holiday periods in august and december our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2020 the most recent date available there were approximately 501 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 104 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds and 204 trillion principal amount of us government bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds as measured by trace was 358 billion in 2020 primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 89 billion as of december 31 2020 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixedincome securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many market participants also use email and instant messaging for trading these securities while these electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with telephonic trading these methods are still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time our platforms’ functionality address many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone email or instant message

demand for our trading platforms has grown as the need for greater execution efficiency and changing regulations have continued to shift trading from voice markets to electronic markets across our product areas we and other trading platforms have responded to this demand with technological advances which have further automated many of the manual processes required by traditional methods of trading although our market share has increased significantly in recent years large components of the fixed income markets in which we operate have not yet migrated to electronic trading because of the diverse and heterogeneous nature of those instruments and because participants in these markets have traditionally operated in a more relationshipdriven environment 

 

regulatory changes have also driven demand for the electronification of fixedincome trading processes the policy objectives of a number of post2008 crisis reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and customer protection act the “doddfrank act” basel iii and mifid ii are to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk these objectives have generally led to increased adoption of electronic trading on regulated markets where price transparency alltoall trading and reporting tools are essential components the volcker rule which limits proprietary trading by banks has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as marketmakers our open trading protocols which are designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment have helped market participants improve their liquidity and turnover in response to these trends during 2020 over 1200 participating client firms provided liquidity via our open trading solutions and we completed approximately 19 million open trading trades an increase of 427  compared to 2019 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platforms provide access to the liquidity generated by the participation of over 1800 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platforms due to the presence on the platforms of our large network of institutional investor clients and their ability to use our open trading protocols to help manage their risk source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients 

as shown in the chart below our total credit trading volume increased from approximately 14 trillion in 2016 to 26 trillion in 2020

 

 

our estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume from 2016 to 2020 is shown in the chart below

open trading is a differentiator that expands the liquidity pool and further increases costsavings for clients 

in the postfinancial crisis years liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised banks’ capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce marketmaking activities even as the buy side’s bond holdings have grown rapidly in this environment open trading our fully electronic alltoall trading environment has emerged as one solution to the postcrisis liquidity problem as a result the liquidity options for open trading participants are broader and more diverse compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties the expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers global dealers regional dealers and specialist marketmaking and proprietary trading firms during 2020 over 1200 unique liquidity providers participated in open trading which improved the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches move orders more efficiently and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement

we believe our open trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading participants to interact with each other thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response we estimate that liquidity takers saved an estimated 6737 million in transaction costs through open trading during 2020 while liquidity providers saved an estimated 3988 million during the year these open trading cost savings are in addition to the potential cost savings institutional investors can achieve by simultaneously requesting bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients via our traditional rfq protocol estimated liquidity taker cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and the best disclosed dealer cover price estimated liquidity provider cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and then current composite bid or offer level offer if the provider if buying bid if provider is selling at the time of the inquiry

independen t ownership structure 

we believe our ownership structure has been an advantage relative to certain of our competitors that are owned by exchange or dealer groups as we have been free to make balanced business and trading protocol decisions with the best interests of both our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in mind we are also able to attract industry leaders with valuable skills and insights to our independent board of directors 

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

broaden our client base in our existing markets and increase penetration with existing clients

we intend to use our broad network of over 1800 active institutional investor and brokerdealer participants to drive more clients to our leading electronic fixedincome trading platforms the number of active participants on our platforms has increased by approximately 80 since 2016 we believe that the continued expansion of our client base will lead to even further increases in the liquidity available on our platforms we expect that the increased liquidity on our platforms and our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings will also help us deepen our market share with our existing clients across our product suite the number of clients trading three or more products on our platforms has increased by 387 from 718 in 2016 to 996 in 2020 last we plan to increase our international presence by increasing the number of firms located outside the us that access our platforms through our venues in europe asia and latin america increasing the number of local currencies available for trading on our platforms and subject to regulatory requirements increasing the number of countries in which we can offer our platforms 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platforms by leveraging our client network and open trading protocols 

we aim to increase the secondary market liquidity on our trading platforms by deploying innovative technology solutions designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our platforms and to address different trade sizes bond liquidity characteristics and trading preferences our open trading protocols exponentially increase the potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2020 our clients executed approximately 19 million trades using our open trading solutions representing 327 of the total credit trading volume on our corporate bond platform in recent years we have also significantly increased the number of participants that provide bond prices to our corporate bond platform via an algorithm which has helped increase the number of algorithmic price responses from 09 million in 2016 to 142 million in 2020 we intend to continue to improve the liquidity of bonds on our platforms by increasing the number of connections we have with algorithmic trading firms we also believe that the combination of open trading and our vast client network provides the basis for marketaxess to deliver meaningful crossborder liquidity or enter into new markets where liquidity is scarcer such as municipal bonds 

continue to develop innovative nextgeneration technologies that will allow our clients to further automate and improve the performance of their trading desks 

we believe that the increased adoption of nextgeneration trading technologies by both dealer and investor clients will create improved liquidity enhanced trading efficiencies and the ability to identify trends within the bond market in recent years we have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machinelearning automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors for example clients can use our rulesbased autoexecution technology with both our traditional rfq protocol and open trading to automatically execute trades meeting defined parameters with diverse sources of liquidity our composite pricing algorithm uses machinelearning to generate near realtime prices for approximately 30000 corporate and sovereign bonds based on a variety of data inputs and our like bonds product uses a datadriven methodology to help clients find liquid tradable alternatives to illiquid bonds we intend to continue to invest in and develop advanced technologies such as these that will make marketaxess an increasingly valuable part of our clients’ trading decisions and workflows

 

expand and strengthen our traderelated service data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle 

we plan to expand and strengthen our existing service data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle so that marketaxess is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in the pretrade period we intend to continue to enhance the value of our information and analytical offerings including the content and capabilities of bondticker ®  axess all ® and composite we plan to enhance and expand the usage of liquiditybridge ®  our execution management system “ems” service for dealers that allows users to manage and facilitate complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms and axess iq tm  our order and execution workflow solution for the wealth management and private banking community we also intend to augment our european posttrade matching and regulatory reporting services that enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to mifid ii the recent acquisition of deutsche börse’s regulatory reporting business is expected to help us expand and improve our services across a broader european client base predominantly in germany france and the nordics regions as the use of our pre and posttrade services and products grow we believe that marketaxess will become further entrenched as a valueadded resource to our clients at each stage of the trading cycle which we believe will further increase the attractiveness and use of our trading platforms

pursue select acquisitions and strategic alliances 

we continually evaluate opportunities to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platforms and existing traderelated services to our clients in 2017 we expanded our strategic alliance with blackrock inc “blackrock” to combine blackrock’s order flow with our open trading solution to improve the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants the acquisition of liquidityedge® llc “liquidityedge” in 2019 provided our clients with access to one of the leading platforms for us treasury trading and it supports the further expansion of our us treasury hedging capabilities for our corporate bond platform in 2020 we acquired the regulatory reporting business of deutsche börse in order to bolster our posttrade and market data services in europe and entered into an agreement to acquire munibrokers a central electronic venue serving municipal bond interdealer brokers and dealers in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution for global institutional investor and dealer clients

we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities brokerdealers also use open trading as a source of liquidity as they manage their risk exposure as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover by using our platforms which may limit their credit exposure 

 

posttrade reporting publishing and matching services

in the european union “eu” and the uk all firms regulated as “investment firms” under mifid ii are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction this process is known as transaction reporting pursuant to the associated markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” the number of fields and the complexity of the information that must be reported to regulators was significantly enhanced firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an arm  such as our subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands to validate and submit such reports our multiasset class arm reporting solution allows our clients to report to 15 different european regulators we have also collaborated with equilend on a full fronttoback securities financing transactions regulation “sftr” solution to support mutual clients with their sftr reporting requirements

competition 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we compete with a broad range of market participants globally some of these market participants compete with us in a particular market while select others compete against the entire spectrum of our platforms and solutions we face five main areas of competition 











 

competitors including companies in which some of our clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore some of our clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our clients with our electronic trading platform s and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the markets we serve in the development of our platform s  working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building apis with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to use our services however the contractual obligations of such clients are nonexclusive see the risk factor captioned “ we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients ”

furthermore a significant number of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platforms and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platforms have been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platforms are built on industrystandard technologies and have been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers redundant system capacity designed to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients and a significant number of our institutional investor clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our primary application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platforms through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platforms directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

we prioritize security throughout our platforms operations and software development we make architectural design and implementation choices to structurally address security risks such as logical and physical access controls perimeter firewall protection and embedded security processes in our systems development lifecycle our cybersecurity program is based on the national institute of standards and technology cyber security framework the “framework” the framework consists of standards guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurityrelated risks and promote the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure our global chief information security officer leads a cybersecurity team in assessing managing and reducing the relevant risks with a goal to assure critical operations and continuous delivery of service we constantly monitor connectivity and suspect events are escalated to our global risk and management teams

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platforms website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

 

we have registered the marketaxess® name and logo for trademark in the us europe and in other parts of the world we also have a number of other registered or pending trademarks and service marks globally including open trading™ bondticker® and now you’re in the market™ among others in addition we own or have filed applications for the rights to trade names copyrights domain names and service marks that we use in the marketing of products and services to clients

 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation in these jurisdictions government regulators and selfregulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business and have broad powers to promulgate and interpret laws rules and regulations that may serve to restrict or limit our business as a matter of public policy these regulators are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations rulemaking by regulators including resulting market structure changes has had an impact on our business by directly affecting our method of operation and at times our profitability 

as registered brokerdealers trading venues and other types of regulated entities as described below certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws rules and regulations including the rules of selfregulatory organizations that cover all aspects of their business including manner of operation system integrity antimoney laundering and financial crimes handling of material nonpublic information safeguarding data capital requirements reporting record retention market access licensing of employees and the conduct of officers employees and other associated persons

regulation can impose and has imposed obligations on our regulated subsidiaries including our brokerdealer subsidiaries these increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices procedures and controls which have increased our costs many of our regulators as well as other governmental authorities are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings examinations inspections and investigations which may result in increased compliance costs penalties fines enhanced oversight increased financial and capital requirements additional restrictions or limitations censure suspension or disqualification of the entity andor its officers employees or other associated persons or other sanctions such as disgorgement restitution or the revocation or limitation of regulatory approvals whether or not resulting in adverse findings regulatory proceedings examinations inspections and investigations can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm’s reputation client relationships and profitability from time to time we and our associated persons have been and are subject to routine reviews none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects as a result of such reviews and any future actions or reviews we may be required to among other things amend certain internal structures and frameworks such as our operating procedures systems and controls

the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change we are unable to predict how certain new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form or whether any changes to existing laws rules and regulations including the interpretation implementation or enforcement thereof or a relaxation or amendment thereof will occur in the future we believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of certain new rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact although a relaxation of or the amendment of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets while we generally believe the net impact of the laws rules and regulations may be positive for our business it is possible that unintended consequences may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined see the risk factor captioned “ our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business ”

us regulation

in the us the sec is the federal governmental agency primarily responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws including adopting and enforcing rules and regulations applicable to brokerdealers one of our brokerdealers operates an alternative trading system “ats” subject to the sec’s regulation ats which includes certain specific requirements and compliance responsibilities in addition to those faced by brokerdealers generally another of our brokerdealers operates an exempt ats for us treasuries brokerdealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business we are also subject to the various antifraud provisions of the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the commodity exchange act certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder we also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers employees and affiliated persons

much of the regulation of brokerdealers’ operations in the united states has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations these selfregulatory organizations adopt rules which are generally subject to approval by the sec that govern the operations of brokerdealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations in the case of our us brokerdealer subsidiaries the principal selfregulatory organization is finra our us brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the sec and finra in addition our brokerdealers’ municipal securitiesrelated activities are subject to the rules of the msrb

title vii of the doddfrank act “title vii” amended the commodity exchange act and the exchange act to establish a regulatory framework for swaps subject to regulation by the cftc and securitybased swaps subject to regulation by the sec the cftc has implemented the majority of its regulations in this area most of which are in effect the sec has also finalized many of its securitybased swap regulations although a significant number are not yet in effect among other things title vii rules require certain standardized swaps to be cleared through a central clearinghouse andor traded on a designated contract market or sef subject to various exceptions title vii also requires the registration and regulation of certain market participants including sefs 

the sec is currently conducting a review of the regulatory framework for fixed income electronic trading platforms for the purpose of evaluating the potential regulatory gaps that may exist among such platforms including ours with respect to access to markets system integrity surveillance and transparency among other things it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or what effect such passage adoption or modification will have whether positive or negative on our industry our clients or us

nonus regulation

outside of the united states we are currently regulated by the fca in the uk de nederlandsche bank “dnb” and the afm in the netherlands the securities  futures commission the “sfc” of hong kong the monetary authority of singapore the “mas” the australian securities and investment commission in australia the “asic” the investment industry regulatory organization of canada the “iiroc” and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil 

the fca’s strategic objective is to ensure that the relevant markets function well and its operational objectives are to protect consumers to protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers it has investigative and enforcement powers derived from the financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma” and subsequent legislation and regulations subject to the fsma individuals or companies that seek to acquire or increase their control in a firm that the fca regulates is required to obtain prior approval from the fca

the legal framework in the netherlands for financial undertakings is predominantly included in the dutch financial supervision act “fsa” the afm like dnb is an autonomous administrative authority with independent responsibility for fulfilling its supervisory function pursuant to the fsa the afm authorizes investment firms the afm is legally responsible for business supervision dnb is responsible for prudential supervision the purpose of prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial undertakings and to contribute to the stability of the financial sector holders of a qualifying holding in short shareholdings or voting rights of 10 or more must apply to the dnb for a declaration of no objection and satisfy the applicable requirements of the fsa 

in january 2018 the eu implemented enhanced rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry including mifid ii and mifir mifid ii and mifir introduced significant changes to the eu financial markets that were designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants by i enhancing pre and posttrade transparency for fixedincome instruments ii increasing and enhancing posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii improving technology synchronization and best execution and iv establishing a consolidated tape for trade data although mifid ii and mifir were intended to help improve the functioning of the eu single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards mifid ii and mifir have caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations have been positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined in particular the possible divergence of the uk from the eu in relation to the future development of mifid ii and mifir and other rules and regulations within the financial markets such as the central securities depository regulation may further increase the complexity operational costs and compliance requirements of our business in the uk and eu 

 

the securities industry and financial markets in the 27 member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu regulations provide for a crossborder “passporting regime”  which allows us to provide our services throughout the eu in reliance upon our authorization from any e  u  member state  historically we have utilized the fca authorizations held by our uk regulated subsidiaries in order to provide regulated services to our european clients outside of the uk in reliance on this passport however the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31 2020 triggering a transition period in which the uk continued to observe applicable eu regulations through december 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” in preparation for brexit we obtained afm authorizations for our subsidiaries in the netherlands in 2019 and we are able to provide regulated services to our clients within the e  u  in reliance on the cross border services passport held by our dutch subsidiaries  see the risk factor captioned “ the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects” 

capital requirements

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to jurisdictional specific regulatory capital requirements designed to maintain the general financial integrity and liquidity of a regulated entity in general they require that at least a minimum amount of a regulated entity’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine requirement to cease conducting business suspension revocation of registration or expulsion by the applicable regulatory authorities and ultimately could require the relevant entity’s liquidation 

in addition a s a result of our selfclearing activities marketaxess corporation is required to finance certain transactions maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing brokerdealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to sec rule 15c33 these requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to global economic and market conditions

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 



























there have been significant declines in trading volumes in the financial markets generally in the past and there may be similar declines in trading volumes generally or across our platforms in particular in the future any one or more of the above factors may contribute to reduced trading volumes our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets

while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas our business operations have historically been substantially located in the us and the uk due to the concentration of our operations in the us and uk we are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors 

our business has been and our results of operations and financial condition may be impacted by the outbreak of and global response to the pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse

 

the global spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has created significant volatility in the markets we serve and has increased uncertainty and economic disruption the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business operations and financial results is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including 













 

 

in addition the increase in our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks related to among other things the increased demand on our information technology resources and systems the increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the increased number of points of possible attack such as laptops and mobile devices both of which are now being used in increased numbers to be secured any failure to effectively manage these increased demands and risks including to timely identify and appropriately respond to cyberattacks may adversely affect our business

 

as a result of the pandemic the global economy is currently experiencing a period of significant turmoil and we have experienced significant changes in our daily operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical factors affecting our industry and our company— economic political and market factors ” due to the uncertainty of the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the uncertainty as to what governmental measures may yet be taken in response to the pandemic and the unpredictable effect on our business our employees and our clients we are not able to reasonably estimate the extent of any potential future impact of the pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations but the impact could be material even after the pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic’s global economic impact further our operating and financial results may be affected in a manner that is not presently known to us or in a manner that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations given the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the pandemic

the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

brexit has significantly affected the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in both the uk and eu and could have a material impact on their economies and the growth of various industries in the future in particular the ecosystem of the eu financial services industry in which we operate which prior to brexit has been heavily centered in london has become more decentralized the exit of the uk has significantly impacted the business environment in which we and our clients operate increased the complexity and cost of conducting business in both the eu and the uk and introduces significant new barriers to crossborder trading including uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject we historically conducted business in europe primarily through the “passporting rights” of our uk subsidiaries which have been eliminated as a result of brexit following brexit we now have new regulatory and operational costs and challenges associated with the operation of our regulated subsidiaries in the netherlands which we use to provide our trading platforms and certain posttrade services to our clients in the eu we could also be adversely affected by having to manage a less centralized customer and employee base

 

brexit is expected to lead to legal uncertainty and divergence between the uk and eu financial regulations which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject in addition the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following brexit brexit has also required us to make changes to the technology underlying our trading platforms and regulatory reporting systems in the uk and eu which has resulted in new regulatory and operational costs and challenges changes to uk immigration policy will also occur as a result of brexit and our access to and our ability to compete for and hire skilled employees in both the uk and the eu is expected to become more constrained 

 

although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of the exit of the uk from the eu any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

risks related to operating in the electronic fixedincome trading markets

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platforms would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platforms and fees generated from related activities 

 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform s and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as “ block trades ”  the level of credit spreads and credit volatility and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment 

a decline in overall market volumes trading volumes on our platforms or our platforms’ market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industry in which we operate is rapidly evolving if we are unable to adapt our business effectively to keep pace with industry changes we may not be able to compete effectively which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the electronic financial services industry is characterized by rapidly changing and increasingly complex technologies and systems changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands including access to new technologies and markets frequent technology and service introductions evolving industry standards changing regulatory requirements and new business models if we are not able to keep pace with changing market conditions or client demands and if our competitors release new functionality or technology before we do our existing platforms solutions and technologies may become obsolete or our competitive position may be materially harmed each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations operating in a rapidly evolving industry involves a high degree of risk and our future success depends in part on our ability to 

















if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future within our markets we compete based on our ability to provide our clients with deep liquidity a broad network of market participants a wide range of products and protocols and comprehensive pretrade trade and posttrade functionality as well as the reliability security and ease of use of our electronic platforms and solutions among other factors we primarily compete with other electronic trading platforms and trading businesses conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone email or instant messaging our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 













 

 

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified due to consolidation which has resulted in increasingly large and sophisticated competitors in recent years our competitors have made acquisitions andor entered into joint ventures and consortia to improve the competitiveness of their electronic trading offerings if as a result of industry consolidation our competitors are able to offer lower cost andor a wider range of trading venues and solutions obtain more favorable terms from thirdparty providers or otherwise take actions that could increase their market share our competitive position and therefore our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected

our operations also include the sale of pre and posttrade services analytics and market data there is a high degree of competition among market data and information vendors in solutions for pre and posttrade data analytics and reporting and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge some of these companies are already in or may enter the electronic trading business accordingly some of our competitors may be able to combine use of their electronic trading platforms with complementary access to market data and analytical tools andor leverage relationships with existing clients to obtain additional business from such clients which could preempt use of our platforms or solutions for example bloomberg refinitiv and ice own trading platforms that compete with ours and also have a data and analytics relationships with the vast majority of institutional wholesale and retail market participants if we are not able to compete successfully in this area in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

 

 

risks related to our future levels of business profitability and growth

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of market participants that use our electronic trading platforms our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platforms by these participants for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platforms we cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 487 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platforms or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platforms or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platforms to enter new markets including new asset classes products and geographies including markets where we have little or no operating experience we may have difficulties identifying and entering into new markets due to established competitors lack of recognition of our brand and lack of acceptance of our platforms and solutions as has occurred with certain of our initiatives in the past

expansion particularly in new geographic markets may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time in particular we may need to make additional investments in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems furthermore our expansion efforts may divert management’s attention or inefficiently utilize our resources if we are not able to manage our expansion effectively our expansion costs could increase at a faster rate than our revenues from these new markets if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage our expansion our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer

we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in any new markets even if we do adapt our products services and technologies we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients to our platforms and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate electronic trading platforms in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platforms and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

















our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example mifid ii was implemented by regulatory bodies in europe in january 2018 we cannot predict the full extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure 

brexit could lead to further legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platforms we cannot predict what future actions the regulatory bodies that supervise our business might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business

 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

risks related to our customer concentration 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platforms by posting prices for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in the us the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities in addition over the past several years there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries and several of our large brokerdealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome products further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platforms by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platforms and increasingly to provide liquidity through our open trading protocols a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients also buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone email and instant messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

credit and operational risks

we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary 

in connection with our anonymous trading protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled by us or through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to the clients on our platforms including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platform s  clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our platform s  although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our anonymous trading participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us 

we have policies procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk though there can be no assurance that they will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixedincome markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

selfclearing exposes us to significant operational liquidity financing and regulatory risks

we began selfclearing substantially all of our bond transactions for our us operations in the third quarter of 2020 and we may expand selfclearing to our foreign operations in the future selfclearing requires us to finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations selfclearing exposes our business to operational risks including business and technology disruption operational inefficiencies liquidity financing and regulatory risks and potentially increased expenses in connection with our conversion to selfclearing for our us operations in 2020 we experienced operational inefficiencies and technology issues which in combination with the capital and liquidity requirements that are imposed on all new selfclearing members resulted in increased fail rates in the immediate period following the conversion although the initial conversion issues for our us clearing operations have been resolved in the future we may encounter difficulties with selfclearing that lead to operating inefficiencies technology issues dissatisfaction amongst our client base disruption in the infrastructure that supports the business inadequate liquidity increased margin requirements with clearing organizations and thirdparty settlement agents who provide financing with respect to transactions reductions in available borrowing capacity and financial loss any such delay disruption expense or failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk moreover any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

 

 

technology it systems and cybersecurity risks

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platforms may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platforms and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platforms information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our platforms and use those of our competitors 

 

further the adoption of new internet networking cloud telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our bond reference databases the clearing and settlement of our open trading transactions and to provide the technology underpinning our us treasury platform we obtain essential reference data and information services from external sources including data received from certain competitors clients selfregulatory organizations and other thirdparty data providers our reference data sources and information providers could increase the price for or withdraw their data or information services for a variety of reasons further as has occurred in the past our competitors could revise the current terms on which they provide us with data or information services or could cease providing us with data or information services altogether for a variety of reasons including competition disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide technology services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud computing and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships has in the past had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platforms systems and infrastructure 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platforms for our clients if our trading platforms cannot cope or expand to cope with demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience disruptions in service slow delivery times and insufficient capacity these consequences could result in our clients deciding to stop using or reduce their use of our platforms which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platforms technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer 

 

and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform s to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

systems failures interruptions delays in service catastrophic events and resulting interruptions in the availability of our trading platforms could materially harm our business and reputation

our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our trading platforms systems networks and infrastructure we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty providers will not experience systems failures or business interruptions as has occurred in the past our systems networks infrastructure and other operations in particular our trading platforms are vulnerable to impact or interruption from a wide variety of causes including irregular or heavy use of our trading platforms during peak trading times or at times of increased market volatility power internet or telecommunications failures hardware failures or software errors human error acts of vandalism or sabotage catastrophic events such as natural disasters extreme weather events or acts of war or terrorism malicious cyberattacks or cyber incidents such as unauthorized access ransomware loss or destruction of data computer viruses or other malicious code and the loss or failure of systems over which we have no control such as loss of support services from critical thirdparty providers in addition we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity andor increased costs associated with such usage

any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to or security breaches affecting our systems networks or infrastructure has in the past and could in the future result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our platforms we internally support and maintain many of our systems and networks including those underlying our trading platforms however we may not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all systems networks or infrastructure problems our failure to monitor or maintain our systems networks and infrastructure including those maintained or supported by our thirdparty providers or to find a replacement for defective or obsolete components within our systems networks and infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we generally have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices for much of our business including redundant systems networks computer software and hardware and data centers to address interruption to our normal course of business our systems networks and infrastructure may not always be fully redundant and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be sufficient or effective similarly although some contracts with our thirdparty providers such as our hosting facility providers require adequate disaster recovery or business continuity capabilities we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation if we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans or if our plans prove insufficient for a particular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur

if we experience design defects errors failures or delays with our platforms products or services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms our business could suffer serious harm 

our platforms products and services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms may and have from time to time contained design defects and errors when first introduced or when new updates or enhancements are released in our development of new protocols platform features and updates and enhancements to our existing platforms products and services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms we may make a design error that causes the platform protocol or feature to operate incorrectly or less effectively many of our protocols also rely on data and services provided by thirdparty providers over which we have limited or no control and may be provided to us with defects errors or failures our clients may also use our platforms products or services together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem

if design defects errors or failures are discovered in our current or future platforms or protocols we may not be able to correct or work around them in a costeffective or timely manner or at all the existence of design defects errors failures or delays that are significant or are perceived to be significant could also result in rejection or delay in market acceptance of our platforms or protocols damage to our reputation loss of clients and related revenues diversion of resources product liability claims regulatory actions or increases in costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 

malicious cyberattacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties 

the operation of our electronic trading platforms relies on the secure processing storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data including confidential client and personal information our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential and personal customer information unavailability or disruption of service computer viruses acts of vandalism or other malicious code cyberattack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact despite the defensive measures we have taken we are and will continue to be subject to attacks which may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

our business also depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our platforms systems networks and infrastructure any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to our systems networks or infrastructure due to a cyberattack could result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the thirdparty service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and trading system software network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyberattack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our trading platform

there have been an increasing number of cyberattacks in recent years in various industries including ours and cybersecurity risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats including the assessment of firms’ vulnerability to cyberattacks in particular regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies practices and procedures protecting firm networks and information identifying and addressing risks associated with clients vendors and other third parties preventing and detecting unauthorized activities adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions

our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyberattack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platforms we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws regulations and obligations could harm our business 

data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations in countries where we do business for example the eu adopted the general data protection regulations “gdpr” which as of may 2018 requires entities both in the european economic area and outside to comply with new regulations regarding the handling of personal data brexit has created additional uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection as the uk now has its own data protection laws which are separate from the eu gdpr we are also subject to certain us federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number in addition to the increased cost of compliance our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the gdpr and other laws and regulations relating to personal data could result in substantial financial penalties for noncompliance expose us to litigation risk and could result in significant liability increased costs or cause our clients to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business  

 

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future functionalities products or services this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if our efforts to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our technology pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could be expensive and timeconsuming to defend make it more difficult to operate or prevent us from operating our business or portions of our business and result in significant monetary liability

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us as they have done in the past with respect to our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

risks related to possible transactions or investments

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies and are unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions or any strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures which we may enter into

from time to time we may pursue acquisitions which may not be completed or if completed may not be as beneficial to us as expected we have made acquisitions in the past including the purchases of liquidityedge in 2019 and the regulatory reporting business of deutsche borse in 2020 we also may consider potential divestitures of businesses from time to time we routinely evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis however even if we execute a definitive agreement there can be no assurance that we will consummate the transaction within the anticipated closing timeframe or at all moreover there is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in the electronic financial services industry

 

if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

















these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges

we may also enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures as a means to accelerate our entry into new markets provide new solutions or enhance our existing capabilities entering into strategic alliances partnerships and joint ventures entails risks including i difficulties in developing or expanding the business of newly formed alliances partnerships and joint ventures ii exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest iii potential conflicts with or among our partners iv the possibility that our partners could take action without our approval or prevent us from taking action and v the possibility that our partners become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations 

 

risks related to key personnel and employees

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel although we have invested in succession plans and we have shortterm contingency plans in place any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of fixed income products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

regulatory and legal risks

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the uk the afm in the netherlands the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland asic in australia the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition our regulatory reporting business is registered as an arm and apa with the fca and the afm

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations most aspects of our brokerdealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including the way we deal with our clients our capital requirements our financial and regulatory reporting practices required recordkeeping and record retention procedures the licensing of our employees and the conduct of our directors officers employees and affiliates 

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered brokerdealers and mtf are subject to us or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from us or our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our ability to operate our platforms in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely or costeffective basis or at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of 

 

the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1 business—government regulation” 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business

our business and the business of many of our clients is subject to extensive regulation governmental and regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may promulgate new or revised or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing rules and regulations at any time the new administration elected in the 2020 us presidential election may enact regulatory changes that may affect our business any such changes in laws rules or regulations or in governmental policies could create additional regulatory exposure for our business cause us to incur significant additional costs require us to change or cease aspects of our business or restrict or limit our ability to grow our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there have been in the past and could be in the future significant technological operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations that derive from compliance with evolving laws rules and regulations

we cannot predict whether additional changes to the laws rules and regulations that govern our business and operations including changes to their interpretation implementation or enforcement will occur in the future or the extent to which any such changes will impact our business and operations for example the divergence of the uk from the eu in relation to the future development of mifid ii and other rules and regulations governing the financial markets such as the central securities depository regulation may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined in addition we cannot predict how current proposals that have not yet been finalized andor that remain subject to ongoing debate will be implemented or in what form we believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new laws rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact additionally unintended consequences of such new laws rules and regulations may adversely affect our industry our clients and us in ways yet to be determined any such legal and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties 

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients have in the past and may in the future make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures failure to protect their confidential or personal information mismanagement or even fraud we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and the services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

liquidity and funding risks

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements the growth of our open trading protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business as a result of our selfclearing activities we are also required to finance certain transactions maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing brokerdealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to sec rule 15c33 although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 











in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing could be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreements with third party lenders which include restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 5000 million subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 2500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things may restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants may restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 





















we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio a minimum regulatory net capital balance for certain subsidiaries and a minimum consolidated adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lenders under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lenders would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

 

economic political and market factors

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients

 

during the first half of 2020 the global economy experienced a period of significant turmoil due to the outbreak of covid19 the “pandemic” the pandemic triggered a steep drop in economic activity that had an immediate and substantial impact on global credit markets credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds as measured by the credit suisse liquid us corporate index “luci index” increased from 11 over us treasuries in december 2019 to 15 in march 2020 and credit spread volatility in us corporate bonds as measured by the luci index increased from 11 in december 2019 to 116 in march 2020 drastic measures taken by central banks and governments helped restore confidence in the credit markets in the second half of 2020 which led to a tightening in credit spreads that helped stimulate record new issuance in us investmentgrade and highyield corporate bonds during the second half of 2020 the credit markets continued to improve as credit yield spreads and credit spread volatility tightened to prepandemic levels the volatile market conditions in 2020 led to an active credit trading environment as the average daily trading volume of us highgrade and highyield corporate bonds for the year ended december 31 2020 as measured by trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” increased by 137 and 197 respectively compared to the year ended december 31 2019

 

as a result of the pandemic we have experienced significant changes in our daily operations in midmarch 2020 we successfully implemented a global work from home mandate for all our employees and we were able to continue to provide our trading platforms and other services to our clients without interruption in particular we believe that open trading liquidity has been increasingly essential to the functioning of credit markets during the pandemic and marketaxess has played a valuable role keeping our clients connected to the market as traders moved from their centralized trading floors to home offices during the first several months of the pandemic we helped over 10000 individual users connect to our trading platforms from their homes although we have reprioritized certain technology projects due to the changing needs of our clients in the current market environment we have largely continued with our hiring plans capital expenditures and the expansion of our trading platforms and services into new jurisdictions 

 

the global spread of the pandemic is complex and rapidlyevolving with authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to try to contain the coronavirus such as travel bans and restrictions social distancing quarantines stay at home orders business limitations and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 vaccinations while we remain confident that we can continue to maintain business continuity serve our clients and provide efficient execution in a virtual environment as necessary we have reopened our offices and have allowed our employees to return to work on a voluntary basis where local regulations permit the reopening of offices has created additional risks and operational challenges relating to maintaining the health and safety of our employees we also anticipate that the full reopening of our offices may require investments in the design implementation and enforcement of new workplace safety protocols these efforts may divert management attention and the protocols may create logistical challenges for our employees which could adversely impact employee productivity and morale

 

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during any future disruptions caused by the pandemic while we have experienced increased market volumes and market share since the outbreak we are cautious of the damaging impact the pandemic may have on the global economy in the longerterm and the adverse impact that a global recession could have on liquidity and market volumes in the global credit markets 

 

we expect that current cash and investment balances in combination with cash flows that are generated from operations and the ability to borrow under our credit agreement as defined below will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months we have not altered our capital management programs and we have increased our dividend for the 12 th consecutive year we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet no borrowings under our credit agreement and with capital significantly in excess of our regulatory requirements

 

in response to the current economic conditions the federal reserve bank of new york the “frbny” established a secondary market corporate credit facility the “facility” that lent money on a recourse basis to a special purpose vehicle “spv” that 

 

purchase d corporate debt issued by eligible issuers in the secondary market  the spv purchase d eligible individual corporate bonds in the secondary market as well as eligible corporate bond portfolios in the form of exchangetraded funds “etfs” in september 2020 we were designated by the frbny as an eligible seller for the facility which allow ed us to p rovide end investors and brokerdealers the opportunity to use open trading to respond directly and anonymously to the frbny’s requests to purchase bonds 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer or alltoall trading platforms competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform total transaction costs and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our business is subject to extensive regulations in the united states and internationally which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause additional legal costs to ensure compliance the existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended resulting in the enactment and enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business for example t he new administration elected in the 2020 us presidential election may enact regulatory changes that may affect our business in 2017 the sec established a fixed income market structure advisory committee in order to provide the sec with diverse perspectives on the structure and operations of the us fixedincome markets as well as advice and recommendations on matters related to fixedincome market structure the impact of any reform efforts on us and our operations remains uncertain  

in addition the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31 2020 triggering a transition period in which the uk continued to observe applicable eu regulations through december 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” in preparation for brexit we obtained authorizations from the netherlands authority for the financial markets for our subsidiaries in the netherlands in 2019 following brexit we now provide regulated services to our clients within the eu in reliance on the crossborder services passport held by our dutch subsidiaries brexit has led to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject in addition the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes is likely to increase following brexit  

compliance with regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources which may adversely affect our profitability however we believe new regulations may also increase demand for our platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic platforms that meet the various regulatory requirements and help them comply with their regulatory obligations  

on august 10 2020 marketaxess corporation our brokerdealer subsidiary converted to selfclearing for the us bond trades to which marketaxess corporation is a counterparty via its open trading functionality previously these bond transactions were settled through a thirdparty clearing broker as a result of this conversion marketaxess corporation is required to segregate funds in a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to rule 15c33 of the securities exchange act of 1934

 

technolog y environment 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure initiatives and continually improve our platforms to further enhance our leading market position we expect that our transition to agile software development processes will help us continue to be a market leader in developing the technology solutions for our clients’ trading needs 

we experience cyberattacks and attempted security breaches cybersecurity incidents could impact revenue and operating income and increase costs we therefore continue to make investments which may result in increased costs to strengthen our cybersecurity measures see also item 1a risk factors  “technology it systems and cybersecurity risks  our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws regulations and obligations could harm our business” 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platforms and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us  











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability  

commission revenue 

commissions are recognized on a trade date basis and generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded and individual client incentives bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

for open trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades for us treasury matched principal trades commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platforms distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

 

other credit commissions other credit includes eurobonds emerging markets bonds highyield bonds  municipal bonds and leveraged loans  commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules our highyield fee plan structure is s imilar to our us highgrade fee plans  c ertain dealers participate in a highyield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols  

rates commissions rates includes us treasury us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for rates products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded us treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol the average rates fee per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

information services

we generate revenue from data licensed to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers professional and consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services these revenues are either for subscriptionbased services transferred over time and may be net of volumebased discounts or onetime services revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided customers are generally billed monthly quarterly or annually revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 

posttrade services

we generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting trade publication and trade matching services customers are generally billed monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period we also generate onetime implementation fees for onboarding clients which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is complete

other revenue 

other revenue includes revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses

segment results 

we operate electronic platforms for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services the financial markets in which we compete and our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for certain geographic information about our business required by us gaap 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019

our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows

 



for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 294 increase in our us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in estimated overall market volume coupled with growth in our estimated market share our estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume increased to 216 for the year ended december 31 2020 from 190 for the year ended december 31 2019 estimated us highgrade trace volume increased by 142 to 63 trillion for the year ended december 31 2020 from 56 trillion for the year ended december 31 2019 

 

other cr edit volumes increased by 295  for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 prim arily due to increases of 684  in us highyield bond volume 213 in eur obond volume and 148  in emerging markets bond volume on a combination of higher estimated us highyield market volume and higher us highyield emerging markets and eur o bond estimated market share  our estimated market share of us highyield trace volume increased to 146  for the year ended december 31 2020 from 104 for the year ended december 31 2019

our average variable transaction fee per million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was as follows 

 



the increase in us highgrade average variable transaction fee per million was mainly due to an increase in the duration of bonds traded on the platforms the increase in other credit average variable transaction fee per million was mainly due to a larger percentage of trading volume in highyield bonds that command higher fees per million the significant decrease in the average variable transaction fee per million for rates products was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us treasuries trading volumes that command lower fees per million

information services information services revenue increased 36 million for the year ended december 31 2020 mainly due to revenue from new data contracts 

posttrade services posttrade services revenue increased 37 million for the year ended december 31 2020 principally due to additional regulatory transaction reporting revenue of 13 million generated by regulatory reporting hub since the november 30 2020 acquisition date and the introduction of new sftr reporting services of 09 million

interest expense increased by 11 million due to shortterm borrowing activity in 2020 to support selfclearing activity

the following tables set forth trading volume and average variable transaction fee per million for the eight quarters ended december 31 2020



 



  liquidity and capital resources 

during the past two years we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand internally generated funds and shortterm borrowings cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled 4890 million at december 31 2020 our investments are generally invested in investmentgrade securities we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes we believe our investments as of december 31 2020 that were in an unrealized loss position were not otherthantemporarily impaired in addition we believe there has not been any event after such date including the recent developments related to the pandemic that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment

 

on august 19 2020 we amended our amended and restated credit agreement the “prior credit agreement” with jpmorgan chase bank na “jpmorgan” to among other things  i  permit investments of up to 500 0 million in marketaxess corporation and ii increase the aggregate commitments of the lender under the prior credit agreement from 100 0 million to 450 0 million which we intend to use from time to time to make advances to our brokerdealer subsidiaries to assist with certain capital or liquidity requirements related to our selfclearing and trade settlement activities and for other general corporate purposes the prior credit agreement matured on november 13 2020 when we entered into a new credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders and jpmorgan as administrative agent  that provides aggregate commitments totaling 500 0 million consisting of a revolving credit f acility and a 5 0 million letter of credit sublimit for standby letters of credit the credit agreement will mature on november 12 2021 with our option to request up to two additional 364day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary conditions as of december 3 1  2020 we had  10 million in letters of credit outstanding and  4 99 0 million in available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  see note 1 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the credit agreement and the prior credit agreement  

in connection with its selfclearing operations marketaxess corporation our brokerdealer subsidiary entered into an agreement the “collateralized agreement” with its settlement bank to provide loans up to an aggregate of 2000 million on an uncommitted basis borrowings under the collateralized agreement are collateralized by securities pledged by marketaxess corporation to the settlement bank subject to applicable haircuts and concentration limits as of december 31 2020 marketaxess corporation had no borrowings outstanding and 2000 million in available borrowing capacity under the collateralized agreement see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the collateralized agreement 

as a result of our selfclearing activities we are required to finance certain transactions maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing brokerdealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to sec rule 15c33 as of december 31 2020 the aggregate amount of the positions financed deposits and customer reserve balances associated with our selfclearing activities was 1382 million these requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources 

during the past two years our cash flows were as follows 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

the 1386 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in net income of 945 million net sales and maturities of trading investments of 639 million income and other tax liabilities of 160 million depreciation and amortization of 91 million and accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities of 68 million these increases in cash provided were offset by an increase of 495 million in net receivables from brokerdealers clearing organizations and customers associated with our selfclearing conversion

the 1909 million net increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities availableforsale of 1277 million and lower cash used for acquisitions of 741 million offset by an increase in capital expenditures of 109 million 

the 270 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to increases in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 166 million and cash dividends paid on common stock of 143 million offset by an increase in exercises of stock options of 28 million and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of 11 million 

past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity business and financial condition 

 

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including liquidity requirements associated with our selfclearing operations and expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec finra and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the fca in the uk or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2020 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2020 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 4354 million in excess of the required levels of 216 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator as of december 31 2020 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 1444 million 

we execute bond transactions between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades in august 2020 one of our us brokerdealer subsidiaries converted to a selfclearing model for the settlement of such transactions our other us and uk subsidiaries continue to settle their transactions through thirdparty clearing brokers settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded under both the selfclearing and the thirdparty clearing broker models we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements each thirdparty clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of our trades we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

on november 30 2020 we acquired regulatory services gmbh the paneuropean regulatory reporting business of deutsche börse group the purchase price was approximately 225 million in cash paid at closing and up to 246 million in contingent consideration payable within 18 months of the closing in september 2020 we entered into an agreement to acquire munibrokers llc a central electronic venue serving municipal bond interdealer brokers and dealers the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2021 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  the purchase price is approximately 450 million in cash plus transaction costs with 200 million paid at closing and up to 250 million in contingent consideration payable within three years of the closing 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy

nongaap financial measures

in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures called earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and free cash flow “fcf” as a result of our conversion to selfclearing we redefined fcf as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failedtodeliver and securities failedtoreceive from brokerdealers clearing organizations and customers less expenditures for furniture equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs we believe these nongaap financial measures when taken into consideration with the corresponding gaap financial measures are important in understanding our operating 

 

results ebitda and fcf are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity we believe that ebitda and fcf provide useful additional information concerning profitability of our operations and business trends and the cash flow available to pay dividends repurchase stock and meet working capital requirements 

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net income to ebitda as defined for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019



 

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to fcf as defined for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

 



effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2020 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2020 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 1571 million and the fair value of the liability was 08 million 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 192 million of investments in corporate bonds that were classified as trading securities adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to global economic and market conditions – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ”

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2020 our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to 4890 million a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease our annual investment income by approximately 48 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

a similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately 02 million the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 02 million would be recognized in other net in the consolidated statements of operations 

we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we conduct operations in several different countries outside of the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in nonus dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 108 of our revenue and 262 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the british pound sterling based on actual results over the past year a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 75 million and operating expenses by approximately 76 million

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus british pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2020 the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 1579 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

 

credit risk 

through certain of our subsidiaries we execute bond transactions between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades in august 2020 one of our us brokerdealer subsidiaries converted to a selfclearing model for the settlement of such transactions our other us and uk subsidiaries continue to settle their transactions through thirdparty clearing brokers settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

we have policies procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk there can be no assurance that these policies procedures and automated controls will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixedincome markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at three major global banks given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at these banks

we entered the us treasury market in 2019 throu gh our acquisition of liquidityedge llc “liquidityedge”  liquidityedge’s innovative custom liquidity pools as well as direct dealer streaming capabilities for on and offtherun us treasuries offers a bespoke trading ecosystem to connect a community of dealers marketmakers and institutional investors to trade in the  5 9 36 billion averagedailyvolume us treasury market in addition to providing marketaxess clients with an enhanced ability t o trade us treasuries  the acquisition is expected to support the future expansion of the company’s hedging capabilities for its clients 

we are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact directly with each other however in connection with our open trading and other anonymous protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker in 2019 261 of all credit volume on the marketaxess platform was executed via open trading protocols up from 220 in 2018

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 976 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 853 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2019 although institutional investors specialist marketmaking firms proprietary trading firms and other nontraditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platform through open trading we believe these brokerdealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security

in 2019 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 190 of the total estimated us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

we provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for european investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products in response to the preand posttrade transparency mandates from the recast markets in financial instruments directive “mifid ii” in europe trax ® has been authorized by each of the uk financial conduct authority “fca” and the netherlands authority for the financial markets “afm” as an approved publication arrangement “apa” and an approved reporting mechanism “arm” in addition to its apa and arm reporting services trax ® has developed a comprehensive suite of valueadd solutions for mifid ii including pretrade transparency services systematic internaliser “si” determination and monitoring best execution reporting commodity position reporting data quality analysis and peer benchmarking

in 2019 907 of our revenues were derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms we also derive revenues from information services posttrade services and other income our revenue can be impacted by seasonal effects caused by increased levels of new bond issuance which often occurs in the first quarter of a year or slowdowns in trading activity particularly during the customary holiday periods in august and december our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2019 the most recent date available there were approximately 326 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 96 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds and 163 trillion principal amount of us government bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds as measured by trace was 310 billion in 2019 primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 88 billion as of december 31 2019 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace 

 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixedincome securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many market participants also use email and instant messaging for trading these securities while these electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with telephonic trading these methods are still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time our platforms’ functionality address many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone email or instant message 

demand for our trading platforms has grown as the need for greater execution efficiency and changing regulations have continued to shift trading from voice markets to electronic markets across our product areas we and other trading platforms have responded to this demand with technological advances which have further automated many of the manual processes required by traditional methods of trading although our market share has increased significantly in recent years large components of the fixed income markets in which we operate have not yet migrated to electronic trading because of the diverse and heterogeneous nature of those instruments and because participants in these markets have traditionally operated in a more relationshipdriven environment 

regulatory changes have also driven demand for the electronification of fixedincome trading processes the policy objectives of a number of post2008 crisis reforms such as the doddfrank wall street reform and customer protection act the “doddfrank act” basel iii and mifid ii are to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk these objectives have generally led to increased adoption of electronic trading on regulated markets where price transparency alltoall trading and reporting tools are essential components the volcker rule which limits proprietary trading by banks has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as marketmakers our open trading protocols which are designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment have helped market participants improve their liquidity and turnover in response to these trends during 2019 almost 1100 participating client firms provided liquidity via our open trading solutions and we completed approximately 14 million open trading trades an increase of 244 compared to 2018

our competitive strengths 

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platforms provide access to the liquidity generated by the participation of over 1700 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients and their ability to use our open trading protocols to help manage their risk source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients 

 

as shown in the chart below our total credit trading volume increased from  978  5 billion in 201 5 to  2 0 trillion in 201 9  

our adjusted estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume from 2015 to 2019 is shown in the chart below

 

 we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from january 2015 through october 2015 because we believe that the trace volume as adjusted by us provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting 

 

open trading is a differentiator that expands the liquidity pool and further increases costsavings for clients 

in the postfinancial crisis years liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised banks’ capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce marketmaking activities even as the buy side’s bond holdings have grown rapidly in this environment open trading our fully electronic alltoall trading environment has emerged as one solution to the postcrisis liquidity problem as a result the liquidity options for open trading participants are broader and more diverse compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties the expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers global dealers regional dealers and specialist marketmaking and proprietary trading firms during 2019 almost 1100 unique liquidity providers participated in open trading open trading improves the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches move orders more efficiently and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement

we believe our open trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading participants to interact with each other thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response we estimate that liquidity takers saved over 2098 million in transaction costs through open trading during 2019 while liquidity providers saved an estimated 1747 million during the year these open trading cost savings are in addition to the potential cost savings institutional investors can achieve by simultaneously requesting bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients via our traditional rfq protocol during 2019 open trading delivered significant transaction cost savings for participants with an estimated 3845 million in aggregate savings for both liquidity providers and liquidity takers estimated liquidity taker cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and the best disclosed dealer cover price estimated liquidity provider cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and then current composite bid or offer level offer if the provider if buying bid if provider is selling at the time of the inquiry

proven innovator with an experienced management team 

since our inception we have been an innovator in the fixedincome securities markets the members of our management team average more than 20 years of experience in the securities industry we have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of fixedincome trading including the existing relationships between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional trading methods and improve liquidity in recent years marketaxess has received industry recognition from key independent publications for its innovations and contributions to the fixedincome market for example in 2019 open trading won the waters technology “buyside technology award” for the best buyside execution venue and composite won the risk “market technology award” for the electronic trading support product of the year and the waters technology “waters rankings award” for the best artificial intelligence technology provider 

some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include 

















independent ownership structure

we believe our ownership structure has been an advantage relative to certain of our competitors that are owned by exchange or dealer groups as we have been free to make balanced business and trading protocol decisions with the best interests of both our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in mind we are also able to attract industry leaders with valuable skills and insights to our independent board of directors 

 

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

broaden our client base in our existing markets and increase penetration with existing clients

we intend to use our broad network of over 1700 active institutional investor and brokerdealer participants to drive more clients to our leading electronic fixedincome trading platforms the number of active participants on our platforms has increased by over 1133 since 2014 we believe that the continued expansion of our client base will lead to even further increases in the liquidity available on our platforms we expect that the increased liquidity on our platforms and our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings will also help us deepen our market share with our existing clients across our product suite the number of clients trading three or more products on our platform has increased by 593 from 614 in 2015 to 978 in 2019 last we plan to increase our international presence by increasing the number of firms located outside the us that access our platforms through our venues in europe asia and latin america increasing the number of local currencies available for trading on our platforms and subject to regulatory requirements increasing the number of countries in which we can offer our platforms 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platforms by leveraging our client network and open trading protocols 

we aim to increase the secondary market liquidity on our trading platforms by deploying innovative technology solutions designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our platforms and to address different trade sizes bond liquidity characteristics and trading preferences our open trading protocols exponentially increase the potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2019 our clients executed approximately 14 million trades using our open trading solutions representing 261 of the total credit trading volume on our corporate bond platform in recent years we have also significantly increased the number of participants that provide bond prices to our corporate bond platform via an algorithm which has helped increase the number of algorithmic price responses from 08 million in 2016 to 94 million in 2019 we intend to continue to improve the liquidity of bonds on our platform by increasing the number of connections we have with algorithmic trading firms we also believe that the combination of open trading and our vast client network provides the basis for marketaxess to deliver meaningful crossborder liquidity or enter into new markets where liquidity is scarcer such as municipal bonds 

continue to develop innovative nextgeneration technologies that will allow our clients to further automate and improve the performance of their trading desks 

we believe that the increased adoption of nextgeneration trading technologies by both dealer and investor clients will create improved liquidity enhanced trading efficiencies and the ability to identify trends within the bond market in recent years we have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machinelearning automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors for example clients can use our rulesbased autoexecution technology with both our traditional rfq protocol and open trading to automatically execute trades meeting defined parameters with diverse sources of liquidity our composite pricing algorithm uses machinelearning to generate near realtime prices for over 25000 corporate bonds based on a variety of data inputs and our like bonds product uses a datadriven methodology to help clients find liquid tradable alternatives to illiquid bonds we intend to continue to invest in and develop advanced technologies such as these that will make marketaxess an increasingly valuable part of our clients’ trading decisions and workflows

 

expand and strengthen our traderelated service data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle 

we plan to expand and strengthen our existing service data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle so that marketaxess is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in the pretrade period we intend to continue to enhance the value of our information and analytical offerings including the content and capabilities of bondticker ®  axess all ® and composite we plan to enhance and expand the usage of liquiditybridge ®  our execution management system “ems” service that allows users to manage and facilitate the complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms including the marketaxess system we also intend to augment our posttrade matching and regulatory reporting services provided by our trax ® brand in europe that enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to mifid ii as the use of our pre and posttrade services and products grow we believe that marketaxess will become further entrenched as a valueadded resource to our clients at each stage of the trading cycle which we believe will further increase the attractiveness and use of our trading platforms

pursue select acquisitions and strategic alliances 

we continually evaluate opportunities to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform and existing traderelated services to our clients in 2017 we expanded our strategic alliance with blackrock inc “blackrock” to combine blackrock’s order flow with our open trading solution to improve the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants the acquisition of liquidityedge in november 2019 provides our clients with access to one of the leading platforms for us treasury trading and it supports the further expansion of our us treasury hedging capabilities for our corporate bond platform in addition we entered into a partnership with virtu financial inc in april 2019 to provide institutions with enhanced trading tools and access to global exchangetraded funds etfs and fixed income securities

the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities brokerdealers are also increasingly turning towards open trading as a new source of liquidity as they manage their risk exposure as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover by using our platform which may limit their credit exposure 

 

posttrade reporting publishing and matching services

in europe all firms regulated as “investment firms” under mifid ii are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction this process is known as transaction reporting pursuant to the associated markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” the number of fields and the complexity of the information that must be reported to regulators was significantly enhanced firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an arm  such as our trax ® arm to validate and submit such reports

competition 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we compete with a broad range of market participants globally some of these market participants compete with us in a particular market while select others compete against the entire spectrum of our platforms and solutions we face five main areas of competition 











competitors including companies in which some of our clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore some of our clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our clients with our electronic trading platforms and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the markets we serve in the development of our platforms working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to use our services however the contractual obligations of such clients are nonexclusive see the risk factor captioned “ we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients ”

furthermore a significant number of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platforms have been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platforms are built on industrystandard technologies and have been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume

we have designed our primary application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

we prioritize security throughout our platforms operations and software development we make architectural design and implementation choices to structurally address security risks such as logical and physical access controls perimeter firewall protection and embedded security processes in our systems development lifecycle our cyber security program is based on the national institute of standards and technology cyber security framework the “framework” the framework consists of standards guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurityrelated risks and promote the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure our global chief information security officer leads a cyber security team in assessing managing and reducing the relevant risks with a goal to assure critical operations and continuous delivery of service we constantly monitor connectivity and suspect events are escalated to our global risk and management teams

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation in these jurisdictions government regulators and selfregulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business and have broad powers to promulgate and interpret laws rules and regulations that may serve to restrict or limit our business as a matter of public policy these regulators are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations rulemaking by regulators including resulting market structure changes has had an impact on our business by directly affecting our method of operation and at times our profitability 

as registered brokerdealers trading venues and other types of regulated entities as described below certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws rules and regulations including the rules of selfregulatory organizations that cover all aspects of their business including manner of operation system integrity antimoney laundering and financial crimes handling of material nonpublic information safeguarding data capital requirements reporting record retention market access licensing of employees and the conduct of officers employees and other associated persons

regulation can impose and has imposed obligations on our regulated subsidiaries including our brokerdealer subsidiaries these increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices procedures and controls which have increased our costs many of our regulators as well as other governmental authorities are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings examinations inspections and investigations which may result in increased compliance costs penalties fines enhanced oversight increased financial and capital requirements additional restrictions or limitations censure suspension or disqualification of the entity andor its officers employees or other associated persons or other sanctions such as disgorgement restitution or the revocation or limitation of regulatory approvals whether or not resulting in adverse findings regulatory proceedings examinations inspections and investigations can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm’s reputation client relationships and profitability from time to time we and our associated persons have been and are subject to routine reviews none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects as a result of such reviews and any future actions or reviews we may be required to among other things amend certain internal structures and frameworks such as our operating procedures systems and controls

 

the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change we are unable to predict how certain new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form or whether any changes to existing laws rules and regulations including the interpretation implementation or enforcement thereof or a relaxation or amendment thereof will occur in the future we believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of certain new rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact although a relaxation of or the amendment of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets while we generally believe the net impact of the laws rules and regulations may be positive for our business it is possible that unintended consequences may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined see the risk factor captioned “ our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business ” 

us regulation

in the us the sec is the federal governmental agency primarily responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws including adopting and enforcing rules and regulations applicable to brokerdealers one of our brokerdealers is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and operates an alternative trading system “ats” subject to the sec’s regulation ats which includes certain specific requirements and compliance responsibilities in addition to those faced by brokerdealers generally another of our brokerdealers operates an exempt ats for us treasuries brokerdealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business we are also subject to the various antifraud provisions of the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” the commodity exchange act certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder we also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers employees and affiliated persons 

the cftc is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal laws governing activities relating to futures swaps and other derivatives including the rules applicable to our sef our sef is subject to regulations that relate to trading and product requirements governance and disciplinary requirements operational capabilities surveillance obligations and financial information and resource requirements including the requirement that they maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year

much of the regulation of brokerdealers’ operations in the united states has been delegated to selfregulatory organizations these selfregulatory organizations adopt rules which are generally subject to approval by the sec that govern the operations of brokerdealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations in the case of our us brokerdealer subsidiaries the principal selfregulatory organization is finra our us brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the sec and finra in addition our brokerdealers’ municipal securitiesrelated activities are subject to the rules of the msrb

following the 2008 financial crisis legislators and regulators in the united states adopted new laws and regulations including the doddfrank act several of these rules could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities which could negatively impact the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platforms for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

in addition title vii of the doddfrank act “title vii” amended the commodity exchange act and the exchange act to establish a regulatory framework for swaps subject to regulation by the cftc and securitybased swaps subject to regulation by the sec the cftc has implemented the majority of its regulations in this area most of which are in effect the sec has also finalized many of its securitybased swap regulations although a significant number are not yet in effect among other things title vii rules require certain standardized swaps to be cleared through a central clearinghouse andor traded on a designated contract market or sef subject to various exceptions title vii also requires the registration and regulation of certain market participants including sefs the sec has proposed but not yet finalized its rules relating to the registration and regulation of securitybased swap execution facilities “sbsefs” if and when the sec finalizes these rules we may register one of our subsidiaries as a sbsef in order to offer trading in certain securitybased swaps

 

the current administration under president tru m p has sought and already passed legislation to rollback key pieces of the doddfrank act in an effort to loosen certain regulatory restrictions on financial institutions although the current administration has indicated a goal of further reforming aspects of its existing financial services regulations it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified or what effect such passage adoption or modification will have whether positive or negative on our industry our clients or us in particular there can be no assurance that rules impacting our clients will be amended or repealed and we continue to expect the industry to be more heavily regulated than it was prior to the 2008 financial crisis 

nonus regulation

outside of the united states we are currently regulated by the fca in the united kingdom “uk” de nederlandsche bank “dnb” and the afm in the netherlands the securities  futures commission the “sfc” of hong kong the monetary authority of singapore the “mas” the australian securities and investment commission in australia the “asic” and the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil 

the fca’s strategic objective is to ensure that the relevant markets function well and its operational objectives are to protect consumers to protect and enhance the integrity of the uk financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers it has investigative and enforcement powers derived from the financial services and markets act 2000 “fsma” and subsequent legislation and regulations subject to the fsma individuals or companies that seek to acquire or increase their control in a firm that the fca regulates is required to obtain prior approval from the fca

the legal framework in the netherlands for financial undertakings is predominantly included in the dutch financial supervision act “fsa” the afm like dnb is an autonomous administrative authority with independent responsibility for fulfilling its supervisory function pursuant to the fsa the afm authorizes investment firms the afm is legally responsible for business supervision dnb is responsible for prudential supervision the purpose of prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial undertakings and to contribute to the stability of the financial sector holders of a qualifying holding in short shareholdings or voting rights of 10 or more must apply to the dnb for a declaration of no objection and satisfy the applicable requirements of the fsa 

the european union “eu” has recently enhanced the existing laws and developed new rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry including mifid ii and mifir which were implemented in january 2018 and which introduced significant changes to the eu financial markets designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe have recently implemented new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were implemented in 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixedincome instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues iv improve technology synchronization and best execution and v establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii is also intended to help improve the functioning of the eu single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations will be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

the securities industry in the member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu regulations provide for a crossborder “passporting regime” which allows us to provide our services throughout the eu in reliance upon our authorization from any eu member state historically we have utilized the fca authorizations held by our uk regulated subsidiaries in order to provide regulated services to our european clients outside of the uk in reliance on this passport however the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” triggering a period during which the uk will continue to observe applicable eu regulations through december 31 2020 or any later extension date the “transition period” in preparation for brexit we obtained afm authorizations for our subsidiaries in the netherlands in 2019 and during the transition period we are able to provide regulated services to our european clients in reliance on the crossborder services passport held by our dutch subsidiaries 

the full effects of brexit will depend on whether the uk is able to retain access to eu markets including for financial services following the transition period although negotiations to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu are continuing based upon the current state of those negotiations we expect that we will rely on our dutch subsidiaries to provide our trading platforms and certain posttrade services to our clients in the eu following the transition period see the risk factor captioned “ the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects” 

 

capital requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to jurisdictional specific regulatory capital requirements designed to maintain the general financial integrity and liquidity of a regulated entity in general they require that at least a minimum amount of a regulated entity’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine requirement to cease conducting business suspension revocation of registration or expulsion by the applicable regulatory authorities and ultimately could require the relevant entity’s liquidation

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business generally

risks related to global economic and market conditions

 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 



























there have been significant declines in trading volumes in the financial markets generally in the past and there may be similar declines in trading volumes generally or across our platforms in particular in the future any one or more of the above factors may contribute to reduced trading volumes our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

 

the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

the uk ceased to be a member of the eu on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” triggering a period during which the uk will continue to observe applicable eu regulations through december 31 2020 or any later extension date the “transition period” based upon the current state of the negotiations between the uk and eu we expect that regulated financial services firms including our uk subsidiaries will lose their “passporting” rights to automatically operate throughout the eu following the transition period this future loss of the existing passport right to the eu will affect us and many of our clients for us it means that we will have to rely on our dutch regulated subsidiaries to provide our trading platforms and certain posttrade services to our clients in the eu 

 

 

b rexit has significantly affect ed the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in both the uk and eu and could have a material impact on their economies and the future growth of various industries in particular the ecosystem of the eu financial services industry in which we operate which prior to brexit has been heavily centered in london has become more decentralized the exit of the uk has significantly impact ed the business environment in which we and our clients operate increase d the cost of conducting business in both the eu and the uk and introduce s significant new uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject as we have historically conduct ed business in europe primarily through our uk subsidiaries we have new regulatory and operational costs and challenges associated with the establishment of our subsidiaries in the netherlands and the management of a less centralized customer and employee base we could also be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the pound sterling and the uk economy 

 

brexit is expected to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject in addition the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following brexit brexit has also required us to make changes to the technology underlying our trading platforms and regulatory reporting systems in the uk and eu which has resulted in new regulatory and operational costs and challenges changes to uk immigration policy will also occur as a result of brexit and our access to and our ability to compete for and hire skilled employees in both the uk and the eu is expected to become more constrained 

 

although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of the exit of the uk from the eu any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

risks related to operating in the electronic fixedincome trading markets

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platforms would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platforms and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platforms and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as ‘block trades’ the level of credit spreads and credit volatility and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment

a decline in overall market volumes trading volumes on our platforms or in our platforms’ market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the industry in which we operate is rapidly evolving if we are unable to adapt our business effectively to keep pace with industry changes we may not be able to compete effectively which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the electronic financial services industry is characterized by rapidly changing and increasingly complex technologies and systems changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands including access to new technologies and markets frequent technology and service introductions evolving industry standards changing regulatory requirements and new business models if we are not able to keep pace with changing market conditions or client demands and if our competitors release new functionality or technology before we do our existing platforms solutions and technologies may become obsolete or our competitive position may be materially harmed each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations operating in a rapidly evolving industry involves a high degree of risk and our future success will depend in part on our ability to 

 



























if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platforms new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platforms for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platforms may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide we cannot assure you that any new features and versions will become or remain successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future within our markets we compete based on our ability to provide our clients with deep liquidity a broad network of market participants a wide range of products and protocols and comprehensive pretrade trade and posttrade functionality as well as the reliability security and ease of use of our electronic platforms and solutions among other factors we primarily compete with other electronic trading platforms and trading businesses conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone email or instant messaging our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 









 





many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified due to consolidation which has resulted in increasingly large and sophisticated competitors in recent years our competitors have made acquisitions andor entered into joint ventures and consortia to improve the competitiveness of their electronic trading offerings if as a result of industry consolidation our competitors are able to offer lower cost andor a wider range of trading venues and solutions obtain more favorable terms from thirdparty providers or otherwise take actions that could increase their market share our competitive position and therefore our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected

our operations also include the sale of pre and posttrade services analytics and market data there is a high degree of competition among market data and information vendors in solutions for pre and posttrade data analytics and reporting and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge some of these companies are already in or may enter the electronic trading business accordingly some of our competitors may be able to combine use of their electronic trading platforms with complementary access to market data and analytical tools andor leverage relationships with existing clients to obtain additional business from such clients which could preempt use of our platforms or solutions for example bloomberg refinitiv and ice own trading platforms that compete with ours and also have a data and analytics relationships with the vast majority of institutional wholesale and retail market participants if we are not able to compete successfully in this area in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

 

risks related to our future levels of business profitability and growth

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of market participants that use our electronic trading platforms our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platforms by these participants for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platforms we cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 481 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 



























as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis as has occurred in the past which could result in decreases in our stock price 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platforms to enter new markets including new asset classes products and geographies including markets where we have little or no operating experience we may have difficulties identifying and entering into new markets due to established competitors lack of recognition of our brand and lack of acceptance of our platforms and solutions as has occurred with certain of our initiatives in the past

expansion particularly in new geographic markets may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time in particular we may need to make additional investments in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems furthermore our expansion efforts may divert management’s attention or inefficiently utilize our resources if we are not able to manage our expansion effectively our expansion costs could increase at a faster rate than our revenues from these new markets if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage our expansion our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer

we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in any new markets even if we do adapt our products services and technologies we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients to our platforms and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 

 

 

risks related to our geographic and customer concentration 

our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate

historically our business operations have been substantially located in the us and the uk while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries such as brexit moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platforms by posting prices for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in the us the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities in addition over the past several years there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries and several of our large brokerdealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome products further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platforms and increasingly to provide liquidity through our open trading protocols a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients also buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone email and instant messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

credit and market risks

we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary 

in connection with our anonymous trading protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to the clients on our platform s  including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platforms clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our platforms although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our anonymous trading participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading protocols and our acquisition of liquidityedge we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

selfclearing will expose us to significant operational financial and liquidity risks 

we intend to begin selfclearing substantially all of our bond transactions for our us operations in the first half of 2020 and we may expand selfclearing to our foreign operations in the future selfclearing requires us to finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations selfclearing exposes our business to operational risks including business and technology disruption operational inefficiencies liquidity and financing risks and potentially increased expenses we may encounter difficulties that may lead to operating inefficiencies including technology issues dissatisfaction amongst our client base disruption in the infrastructure that supports the business inadequate liquidity increased margin requirements with clearing organizations and thirdparty settlement agents who provide financing with respect to transactions reductions in available borrowing capacity and financial loss any such delay disruption expense or failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk moreover any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

the fixedincome products that can be traded through our open trading functionality as well as our investments in fixed and variable rate debt financial instruments are subject to significant interestrate and foreign currency exchange rate risks to manage these and the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our riskmanagement methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our riskmanagement methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our riskmanagement policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24houraday global nature of our business 

 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

technology and it systems risks

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platforms may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platforms and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platforms information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our platforms and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our bond reference databases the clearing and settlement of our open trading transactions and to provide the technology underpinning our us treasury platform we obtain essential reference data and information services from external sources including data received from certain competitors clients selfregulatory organizations and other thirdparty data providers our reference data sources and information providers could increase the price for or withdraw their data or information services for a variety of reasons further as has occurred in the past our competitors could revise the current terms on which they provide us with data or information services or could cease providing us with data or information services altogether for a variety of reasons including competition disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide technology services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud computing and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships has in the past had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platforms systems and infrastructure 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platforms for our clients if our trading platforms cannot cope or expand to cope with demand or otherwise fail to perform we could experience disruptions in service slow delivery times and insufficient capacity these consequences could result in our clients deciding to stop using or reduce their use of our platforms which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platforms technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platforms to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

systems failures interruptions delays in service catastrophic events and resulting interruptions in the availability of our trading platforms could materially harm our business and reputation

our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our trading platforms systems networks and infrastructure we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty providers will not experience systems failures or business interruptions as has occurred in the past our systems networks infrastructure and other operations in particular our trading platforms are vulnerable to impact or interruption from a wide variety of causes including irregular or heavy use of our trading platforms during peak trading times or at times of increased market volatility power internet or telecommunications failures hardware failures or software errors human error acts of vandalism or sabotage catastrophic events such as natural disasters extreme weather events or acts of war or terrorism malicious cyberattacks or cyber incidents such as unauthorized access ransomware loss or destruction of data computer viruses or other malicious code and the loss or failure of systems over which we have no control such as loss of support services from critical thirdparty providers in addition we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity andor increased costs associated with such usage

 

any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to or security breaches affecting our systems networks or infrastructure has in the past and could in the future  result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms  could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our platforms  

we internally support and maintain many of our systems and networks including those underlying our trading platforms however we may not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all systems networks or infrastructure problems our failure to monitor or maintain our systems networks and infrastructure including those maintained or supported by our thirdparty providers or to find a replacement for defective or obsolete components within our systems networks and infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner when necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we generally have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices for much of our business including redundant systems networks computer software and hardware and data centers to address interruption to our normal course of business our systems networks and infrastructure may not always be fully redundant and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be sufficient or effective similarly although some contracts with our thirdparty providers such as our hosting facility providers require adequate disaster recovery or business continuity capabilities we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation if we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans or if our plans prove insufficient for a particular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur

if we experience design defects errors failures or delays with our platforms products or services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms our business could suffer serious harm 

our platforms products and services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms may and have from time to time contained design defects and errors when first introduced or when new updates or enhancements are released in our development of new protocols platform features and updates and enhancements to our existing platforms products and services including our autoexecution technology and pricing algorithms we may make a design error that causes the platform protocol or feature to operate incorrectly or less effectively many of our protocols also rely on data and services provided by thirdparty providers over which we have limited or no control and may be provided to us with defects errors or failures our clients may also use our platforms products or services together with their own software data or products from other companies as a result when problems occur it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem

if design defects errors or failures are discovered in our current or future platforms or protocols we may not be able to correct or work around them in a costeffective or timely manner or at all the existence of design defects errors failures or delays that are significant or are perceived to be significant could also result in rejection or delay in market acceptance of our platform or protocols damage to our reputation loss of clients and related revenues diversion of resources product liability claims regulatory actions or increases in costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

 

cybersecurity risks 

malicious cyberattacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties

the operation of our electronic trading platforms relies on the secure processing storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data including confidential client and personal information our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential and personal customer information unavailability or disruption of service computer viruses acts of vandalism or other malicious code cyberattack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact despite the defensive measures we have taken we are and will continue to be subject to attacks which may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

our business also depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our platforms systems networks and infrastructure any failure of or significant interruption delay or disruption to our systems networks or infrastructure due to a cyberattack could result in disruption to our operations including disruptions in service to our clients slower response times distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades delays in trade execution incomplete or inaccurate accounting recording or processing of trades significant expense to repair replace or remediate systems networks or infrastructure financial losses and liabilities to clients loss of clients legal or regulatory claims proceedings penalties or fines we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the thirdparty service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and trading system software network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyberattack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure any system failure or significant interruption delay or disruption in our operations or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our trading platform

there have been an increasing number of cyberattacks in recent years in various industries including ours and cybersecurity risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats including the assessment of firms’ vulnerability to cyberattacks in particular regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies practices and procedures protecting firm networks and information identifying and addressing risks associated with clients vendors and other third parties preventing and detecting unauthorized activities adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions

our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyberattack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platforms we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

 

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future functionalities products or services this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if our efforts to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property the value of our brand may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our technology pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 















we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us as they have done in the past with respect to our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to possible transactions or investments 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

from time to time we may consider acquisitions which may not be completed or if completed may not be as beneficial to us as expected we have made acquisitions in the past including the purchase of xtrakter in 2013 and liquidityedge in 2019 we also may consider potential divestitures of businesses from time to time we routinely evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis however even if we execute a definitive agreement there can be no assurance that we will consummate the transaction within the anticipated closing timeframe or at all moreover there is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in the electronic financial services industry

if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

















these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

if we enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures we may not realize the anticipated strategic goals for any such transactions

from time to time we may enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures as a means to accelerate our entry into new markets provide new solutions or enhance our existing capabilities entering into strategic alliances partnerships and joint ventures entails risks including i difficulties in developing or expanding the business of newly formed alliances partnerships and joint ventures ii exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest iii potential conflicts with or among our partners iv the possibility that our partners could take action without our approval or prevent us from taking action and v the possibility that our partners become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations

 

in addition there may be a long negotiation period before we enter into a strategic alliance partnership or joint venture or a long preparation period before we commence providing the intended product or solution andor begin earning revenues pursuant to such arrangement we typically incur significant business development expenses and management’s attention may be diverted from the operation of our existing business during the discussion and negotiation period with no guarantee of consummation of the proposed transaction even if we succeed in developing a strategic alliance partnership or joint venture with a new partner we may not be successful in maintaining the relationship which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures on terms that are favorable to us or at all or that any strategic alliance partnership or joint ventures we have entered into or may enter into will be successful in particular these arrangements may not generate the expected number of new clients or increased trading volume or other benefits we seek unsuccessful strategic alliances partnerships or joint ventures or those that do not fully meet our expectations could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgement which requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

risks related to key personnel and employees

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel although we have invested in succession plans and we have shortterm contingency plans in place any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of fixed income products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

regulatory risks 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the uk the afm in the netherlands the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm and apa with the fca and the afm

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including 













we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered brokerdealers and mtf are subject to us or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from us or our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our ability to operate our platform in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely or costeffective basis or at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1 business—government regulation” 

 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body 

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business

our business and the business of many of our clients is subject to extensive regulation governmental and regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may promulgate new or revised or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing rules and regulations at any time any such changes in laws rules or regulations or in governmental policies could create additional regulatory exposure for our business cause us to incur significant additional costs require us to change or cease aspects of our business or restrict or limit our ability to grow our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there have been in the past and could be in the future significant technological operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations that derive from compliance with evolving laws rules and regulations

changes in legislation and in the rules and regulations promulgated by domestic and foreign regulators and how they are applied often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of dealers and other financial services intermediaries including our dealer clients and could result in restrictions in the way we and our clients conduct business for example various rules promulgated since the financial crisis including under the doddfrank act could adversely affect our dealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of products thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform our business and that of our clients could also be affected by the monetary policies adopted by the federal reserve and foreign central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our clients or increase the cost for our clients to trade certain instruments on our trading platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for financing and investment activities and may impact the value of the financial instruments we hold

in addition regulatory bodies in europe have recently developed new rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry including mifid ii and mifir which were implemented in january 2018 and which introduced significant changes to the eu financial markets designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants mifid ii and mifir may have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability to offer our trading platforms in a manner that can successfully compete against other methods of trading additionally most of the world’s major economies have introduced and continue to introduce regulations implementing basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy stress testing and market liquidity risk the continued implementation of these and other bank capital standards could restrict the ability of our large bank and dealer customers to raise additional capital or use existing capital for trading purposes which might cause them to trade less on our trading platforms and diminish transaction velocity in addition as regulations are introduced which affect our prudential obligations the regulatory capital requirements imposed on certain of our subsidiaries may change

we believe that it remains premature to know conclusively how specific aspects of the regulatory developments described above may directly affect our business we cannot predict whether additional changes to the laws rules and regulations that govern our business and operations including changes to their interpretation implementation or enforcement will occur in the future or the extent to which any such changes will impact our business and operations in addition we cannot predict how current proposals that have not yet been finalized andor that remain subject to ongoing debate will be implemented or in what form we believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new laws rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact additionally unintended consequences of such new laws rules and regulations may adversely affect our industry our clients and us in ways yet to be determined any such legal and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws regulations and obligations could harm our business 

certain types of information we collect compile store use transfer andor publish are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and information security these laws and regulations govern the storing sharing use processing transfer disclosure and protection of personal information and other content the scope of these laws and regulations are changing subject to differing interpretations may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules we are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and obligations to third parties related to applicable privacy data protection and information security

 

the regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is uncertain and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and we expect that there will continue to be new laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security proposed and enacted in the various jurisdictions in which we operate for example european legislators adopted the general data protection regulations “gdpr” that became effective in may 2018 the gdpr imposes more stringent e  u  data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance further brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the uk  in particular it is unclear whether the u  k  will enact data protection laws or regulations designed to be consistent with the gdpr and how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated 

our efforts to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws and regulations could entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and could impact our ability to provide certain solutions additionally if our thirdparty providers violate any of these laws or regulations such violations may also put our operations at risk any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any of our obligations relating to privacy data protection or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions litigation claims or negative publicity and could result in significant liability increased costs or cause our clients to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business

the extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties 

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results

legal risks

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential or personal information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions

our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients have in the past and may in the future make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures failure to protect their confidential or personal information mismanagement or even fraud we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and the services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to growing our us and international operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate electronic trading platforms in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

















our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example mifid ii and mifir were implemented by regulatory bodies in europe in january 2018 we cannot predict the full extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure 

brexit could lead to further legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform we cannot predict what future actions the regulatory bodies that supervise our business might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in addition we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service and the period before the product or service is successfully developed introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years even after incurring these costs our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries outside the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in nonus dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our net investment in our uk subsidiaries and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

liquidity and funding risks

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

















the growth of our open trading protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing could be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “ our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions ” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 1000 million subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things may restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants may restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 

 





















we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a minimum net regulatory capital balance for certain subsidiaries and a minimum consolidated adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

 

risks related to our internal controls

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 











 







most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the future 

there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or if we continue paying dividends that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods if we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends investors may need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 







provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition certain of our executives have severance agreements that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we primarily compete with other electronic trading platforms and trading business conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone email or instant messaging competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform total transaction costs the quality and speed of execution and our platforms’ features and trading functionalities we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our business is subject to extensive regulations in the united states and internationally which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause additional legal costs to ensure compliance see “business — government regulation” the existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended resulting in enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business the current regulatory environment in the united states may be subject to future legislative changes driven by the current presidential administration as it largely pursues policies of financial deregulaton in 2017 the sec established a fixed income market structure advisory committee in order to provide the sec with diverse perspectives on the structure and operations of the us fixedincome markets as well as advice and recommendations on matters related to fixedincome market structure the impact of any reform efforts on us and our operations remains uncertain 

 

in addition the u  k  ceased to be a member of the e  u  on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit”  triggering a period during which the u  k  will continue to observe applicable e  u  regulations through december 31 2020 or any later extension date the “transition period” in preparation for brexit we obtained afm authorizations for our subsidiaries in the netherlands in 2019 and during the transition period we are able to provide regulated services to our european clients in reliance on the cross border services passport held by our dutch subsidiaries  brexit is expected to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject in addition the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following brexit  

 

compliance with regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources which may adversely affect our profitability however we believe new regulations may also increase demand for our platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic platforms that meet the various regulatory requirements and help them comply with their regulatory obligations

technology environment 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure initiatives and continually improve our platforms to further enhance our leading market position we expect that our transition to agile software development processes will help us continue to be a market leader in developing the technology solutions for our clients’ trading needs 

we experience cyberthreats and attempted security breaches cyber security incidents could impact revenue and operating income and increase costs we therefore continue to make investments which may result in increased costs to strengthen our cybersecurity measures see also item 1a risk factors  “cybersecurity risks” 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platforms and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our disclosed trading transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

for open trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades for us treasury matched principal trades commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis

 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions  our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform  distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

other credit commissions other credit includes eurobonds emerging markets bonds highyield bonds municipal bonds and leveraged loans commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules our highyield fee plan structure is similar to our us highgrade fee plans certain dealers participate in a highyield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

rates commissions rates includes us treasury us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for rates products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded us treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol the average rates fee per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

information services

we generate revenue from data licensed to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers professional and consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services these revenues are either for subscriptionbased services transferred over time and may be net of volumebased discounts or onetime services revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided customers are generally billed monthly quarterly or annually revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 

posttrade services

we generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting trade publication and trade matching services customers are generally billed monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period we also generate onetime implementation fees for onboarding clients which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is complete

segment results 

we operate electronic platforms for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services the financial markets in which we compete and our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for certain geographic information about our business required by us gaap

our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows

 



for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 140 increase in our us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in estimated overall market volume coupled with growth in our estimated market share our estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume increased to 190 for the year ended december 31 2019 from 181 for the year ended december 31 2018 estimated us highgrade trace volume increased by 81 to 56 trillion for the year ended december 31 2019 from 51 trillion for the year ended december 31 2018

information services information services revenue increased 25 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase is attributable to revenue from new data contracts of 32 million offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar of 07 million

the following tables set forth trading volume and average variable transaction fee per million for the eight quarters ended december 31 201 9  



 



  liquidity and capital resources 

during the past two years we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally generated funds cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled 5006 million at december 31 2019 

in october 2015 we entered into a twoyear amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” that increased our borrowing capacity to an aggregate of 1000 million in october 2017 we amended the credit agreement and extended the maturity date to october 2018 the amended credit agreement also provided for two additional oneyear extension options and modified certain borrowing terms and covenants following the exercise of the first option to extend the maturity date by one year in october 2018 we exercised our second option in october 2019 to extend the maturity date to october 2020 subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by an additional 500 million as of december 31 2019 we had 10 million in letters of credit outstanding and 990 million in available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement

 

during the past two years our cash flows were as follows 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018 

the 420 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in net income of 321 million stockbased compensation expense of 94 million and amortization of operating lease rightofuse assets of 58 million decreases in deferred taxes of 39 million and net purchases of corporate debt trading investments of 32 million offset by an increase in working capital of 110 million

the 718 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to cash of 974 million used as partial consideration for the acquisition of liquidityedge net of cash and restricted cash acquired offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities availableforsale of 129 million and a decrease in capital expenditures of 129 million the decrease in capital expenditures was comprised of a 236 million decrease in purchases of furniture equipment and leasehold improvements related to the buildout of our new headquarters in new york city offset by an increase in capitalized software development costs of 107 million

the 254 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an increase in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 178 million and an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 138 million offset by a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of 79 million 

nongaap financial measures

in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures called earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and free cash flow “fcf” we define fcf as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments less expenditures for furniture equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs we believe these nongaap financial measures when taken into consideration with the corresponding gaap financial measures are important in understanding our operating results ebitda and fcf are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity we believe that ebitda and fcf provide useful additional information concerning profitability of our operations and business trends and the cash flow available to pay dividends repurchase stock and meet working capital requirements 

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net income to ebitda as defined for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018



 

 

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to fcf as defined for the years ended december 31 201 9 and 201 8  

 



other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the uk or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2019 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2019 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 2197 million in excess of the required levels of 158 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator as of december 31 2019 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 1539 million 

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through thirdparty clearing brokers settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded under securities clearing agreements with third party clearing brokers we maintain collateral deposits with each clearing broker in the form of cash the amount of the collateral deposits which are disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows as restricted cash and included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition was 41   million and 11 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements each thirdparty clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty failure on any of our trades we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to this right for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy

 

effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2019 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2019 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 1559 million and the fair value of the liability was 28 million 

 

 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019 we had 2243 million of investments in corporate bonds and us treasuries that were classified as securities availableforsale or trading securities adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our business generally – global economic and market conditions – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2019 our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to 5006 million a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease our annual investment income by approximately 49 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2019 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 11 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 11 million would be recognized in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

a similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately 12 million the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 12 million would be recognized in other net in the consolidated statements of operations 

we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we conduct operations in several different countries outside of the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in nonus dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

during the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 144 of our revenue and 289 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the british pound sterling based on actual results over the past year a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 74 million and operating expenses by approximately 70 million

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus british pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2019 the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 1587 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

 

credit risk 

certain of our subsidiaries act as a matched principal counterparty in connection with the open trading and other transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading protocols and our acquisition of liquidityedge we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixedincome markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

we intend to begin selfclearing substantially all of our bond transactions for our us operations in the first half of 2020 and we may expand selfclearing to our foreign operations in the future see the risk factor captioned “ selfclearing will expose us to significant operational financial and liquidity risks” 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at this bank

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixedincome market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments using our patented trading technology over 1500 institutional investor and brokerdealer firms are active users of our trading platform accessing global liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european bonds us agency bonds municipal bonds leveraged loans credit default swaps and other fixedincome securities through our open trading™ protocols we execute bond trades between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in an alltoall anonymous trading environment in which marketaxess acts as the matched principal counterparty we also offer a number of tradingrelated products and services including composite pricing and other market data products to assist clients with trading decisions autoexecution and other execution services for clients requiring specialized workflow solutions connectivity solutions that facilitate straightthrough processing and technology services to optimize trading environments through our trax ® division we also offer a range of pre and posttrade services including trade matching trade publication regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome and other products 

 

our platform’s innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics our traditional requestforquote “rfq” model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond our open trading protocols complement our rfq model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an alltoall trading environment clients can use our autoexecution technology with both our traditional rfq and open trading protocols thereby using rulesbased execution to connect to diverse sources of liquidity while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors our platform also provides our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixedincome securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many market participants also use email and other electronic means of communication for trading these securities while these electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with traditional bond trading methods we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time our platform’s functionality addresses many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone or via email

our services relating to trade execution range from providing a suite of trading protocols designed to fit the trading needs of our clients to innovative new trading technologies such as autoexecution and the use of artificial intelligence to assist our clients’ trading decisions trading protocols include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds autoexecution allows clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders and our system will determine whether or not to execute a trade in accordance with the predefined parameters once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

 

we are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platform between institutional inv estor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact directly with each other however in connection with our open tradin g protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled thr ough a thirdparty clearing broker in 2018  220  of all marketaxess platform volume was executed via open trading protocols up from 15  9  in 201 7  

in recent years corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined partly as a result of these trends overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover we have responded with a series of open trading protocols designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2018 almost 1000 participating client firms provided liquidity via our open trading solutions and we completed approximately 11 million open trading trades an increase of 732 compared to 2017

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 977 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 836 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2018 although institutional investors specialist marketmaking firms proprietary trading firms and other nontraditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platform through open trading tm  we believe these brokerdealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform 

in 2018 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 181 of the total estimated us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

through our trax ® brand we provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for european investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products in response to the preand posttrade transparency mandates from the recast markets in financial instruments directive “mifid ii” in europe trax ® has been authorized by the uk financial conduct authority “fca” as an approved publication arrangement “apa” and an approved reporting mechanism “arm” in addition to its apa and arm reporting services trax ® has developed a comprehensive suite of valueadd solutions for mifid ii including pretrade transparency services systematic internaliser “si” determination and monitoring best execution reporting commodity position reporting data quality analysis and peer benchmarking

in 2018 897 of our revenues were derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information services posttrade services and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2018 the most recent date available there were approximately 424 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 92 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to sifma the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds as measured by trace was 286 billion in 2018 primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 54 billion as of december 31 2018 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace 

 

prior to regulatory reforms  such as basel iii and regulations under the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” dealer balance sheets were relatively elastic so dealers were able to facilitate trading in most f ixedincome products without dramatic price moves the regulatory reforms enacted after the global financial crisis resulted in greater capital and liquidity requirements for dealers which impacted market liquidity and diminished risk appetite by market i ntermediaries the volcker rule which limits proprietary trading by banks has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as marketmakers as a result we believe market participants require different solutions to increase liquidity and we have responded with our open trading protocols designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform by allowing our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an all toall trading environment 

markets for securities traded on our platform

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us highgrade corporate bond market represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market finra includes over 65000 unique securities in the list of traceeligible bonds representing the majority of the daily trading volume of highgrade bonds according to sifma us highgrade corporate bond debt outstanding has increased approximately 196 from 77 trillion at yearend 2013 to 92 trillion at september 30 2018 over the last five years highgrade corporate bond issuance was over 1 trillion each year exceeding prefinancial crisis levels notwithstanding the growth in the total amount of debt outstanding turnover which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding for the bonds that traded is below precredit crisis levels the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace increased to approximately 51 trillion for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 49 trillion and 46 trillion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively we believe that the low level of turnover is an indicator of liquidity challenges in the credit markets

us crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investmentgrade by one agency but investmentgrade by the other  the total annual amount of highyield corporate bond issuance as reported by sifma decreased by 391 to 1730 billion in 2018 from 2849 billion in 2017 the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2018 was approximately 80 billion compared to 82 billion and 85 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

emerging markets bond market

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the nine months ended september 30 2018 the most recent date available was 203 billion compared to 199 billion and 207 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

european corporate bond market 

the european corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 





 





we believe that the european corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market the total amount of euro denominated highgrade and highyield bonds yearly issuance as reported by international capital markets association decreased by 120 to 3936 billion in 2018 from 4474 billion in 2017 the average daily trading volume of european corporate bonds as estimated by trax ® for the year ended december 31 2018 was approximately 92 billion compared to 87 billion and 82 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

us agency bond market 

we define the us agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 19 trillion as of september 30 2018 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of us agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace was 36 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 38 billion and 51 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

us municipal bond market 

municipal bonds are debt securities issued by states cities counties and other governmental entities in the us to fund daytoday obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects such as highways or water systems depending on the type of financing payments of the principal and interest on a municipal bond may come from general revenues of the municipal issuer specific tax receipts revenues generated from a public project or payments from private entities or from a combination of sources in addition to being issued for many different purposes municipal securities are also issued in many different forms such as fixed rate zero coupon or variable rate bonds the interest paid on municipal securities is typically exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes as well as of december 31 2018 there were over 15 million different municipal bonds outstanding in the total aggregate principal amount of more than 38 trillion in 2018 the average daily trading volume of municipal bonds excluding variable rate demand notes as measured by the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” was 60 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 55 billion and 74 billion for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

credit derivative market 

credit derivatives are contracts that allow market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations without ownership of the underlying security among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions we operate a swap execution facility pursuant to the us commodity futures trading commission’s “cftc” rules and we list certain credit derivatives for trading by us persons and other participants on our sef the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs that would govern the execution of singlename credit derivatives 

posttrade reporting publishing and matching services

in europe all firms regulated as “investment firms” under mifid ii are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction this process is known as transaction reporting pursuant to the associated markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” the number of fields and the complexity of the information that must be reported to regulators was significantly enhanced firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an arm in addition under mifir all regulated investment firms are required to comply with pre and posttrade transparency requirements pursuant to which quotes and trades must be made public subject to a system of waivers and deferrals firms are required to utilize an apa to comply with the posttrade transparency requirement trade matching enables counterparties to agree on the terms of a trade shortly after execution reducing the risk of trade errors and fails during settlement

 

our competitive strengths 

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of over 1500 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients and their ability to use our open trading protocols to help manage their risk source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients 

as shown in the chart below our total bond trading volume increased from 7670 billion in 2014 to 17 trillion in 2018 

 

our adjusted estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume from 201 4 to 2018 is shown in the chart below 

 

 we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 because we believe that the trace volume as adjusted by us provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting 

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from our brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools available on our bondticker® service  including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from all of our participating brokerdealer clients during the trade process on any debt security in our database of corporate bonds institutional investors and brokerdealer clients can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually through our open trading protocols participants may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

expanded liquidity pool in the postfinancial crisis years liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised banks’ capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce marketmaking activities even as the buy side’s bond holdings have grown rapidly in this environment open trading our fully electronic alltoall trading environment has emerged as one solution to the postcrisis liquidity problem as a result the liquidity options for open trading participants are broader and more diverse compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties the expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers global dealers regional dealers and specialist marketmaking and proprietary trading firms during 2018 almost 1000 unique liquidity providers participated in open trading open trading improves the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches move orders more efficiently and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement 

 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients  including realtime trade details stp account allocations automated audit trails and trade detail matching  these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple op portunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors brokerdealers and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing and transaction cost analysis that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is approximately 13 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 720 we believe our open trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading participants to interact in an alltoall trading environment thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers our autoexecution technology uses rulesbased execution logic to reduce trading inefficiencies and human errors while allowing traders to focus on highervalue trades in addition our bondticker ® service eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communications to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

limited information leakage our open trading protocols allow our institutional investor clients to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation through to settlement without limiting their number of potential trading counterparties in addition our private axes ® protocol allows participants to negotiate bilaterally on an anonymous basis to minimize information leakage when transacting in larger trade sizes 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities brokerdealers are also increasingly turning toward open trading as a new source of liquidity as they manage their risk exposure as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover by using our platform which may limit credit exposure

some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include 















 

independence 

we believe the current regulatory environment creates competitive advantages for independent companies like us that are less prone to conflicts of interest as an independent company we are free to make business and trading protocol decisions with the best interests of both our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in mind we are also able to attract industry leaders with valuable skills and insights to our independent board of directors 

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

broaden our client base in our existing markets and increase penetration with existing clients

we intend to use our broad network of over 1500 active institutional investor and brokerdealer participants to drive more clients to our leading electronic fixedincome trading platform the number of active participants on our platform has increased by over 90 since 2013 we believe that the continued expansion of our client base will lead to even further increases in the liquidity available on our platform we expect that the increased liquidity on our platform and our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings will also help us deepen our market share with our existing clients across our product suite the number of clients trading three or more products on our platform has increased by 670 from 509 in 2014 to 850 in 2018 last we will seek to increase our international presence by increasing the number of firms located outside the us that access our platform through our venues in europe asia and latin america increasing the number of local currencies available for trading on our platform and subject to regulatory requirements increasing the number of countries in which we can offer our platform 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform by leveraging our client network and open trading protocols 

we aim to increase the secondary market liquidity on our trading platform by deploying innovative technology solutions designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our platform and to address different trade sizes bond liquidity characteristics and trading preferences our open trading protocols exponentially increase the potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2018 our clients executed approximately 11 million trades using our open trading solutions representing 220 of the total trading volume on our platform in recent years we have also significantly increased the number of participants that provide bond prices to our platform via an algorithm which has helped increase the number of price responses on our platform by 1421 from 2015 to 2018 we intend to continue to improve the liquidity of bonds on our platform by increasing the number of connections we have with algorithmic trading firms we also believe that the combination of open trading and our vast client network provides the basis for marketaxess to deliver meaningful crossborder liquidity or enter into new markets where liquidity is scarcer such as municipal bonds 

continue to develop innovative nextgeneration technologies that will allow our clients to further automate and improve the performance of their trading desks 

we believe that the increased adoption of nextgeneration trading technologies by both dealer and investor clients will create improved liquidity enhanced trading efficiencies and the ability to identify trends within the bond market in recent years we have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machinelearning automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors for example clients can use our rulesbased autoexecution technology with both our traditional rfq protocol and open trading to automatically execute trades meeting defined parameters with diverse sources of liquidity our composite pricing algorithm uses machinelearning to generate near realtime prices for over 25000 corporate bonds based on a variety of data inputs and our like bonds product uses a datadriven methodology to help clients find liquid tradable alternatives to illiquid bonds we intend to continue to invest in and develop advanced technologies such as these that will make marketaxess an increasingly valuable part of our clients’ trading decisions and workflows

 

expand and strengthen our traderelated service  data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle

competition 

the industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 









 

competitors including companies in which some of our clients h ave invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore some of our clients have made and may in the future c ontinue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to use our services however the contractual obligations of such clients are nonexclusive see the risk factor captioned “ we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients ”

furthermore a significant number of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients and a significant number of our institutional investor clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements inc lude third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology pr ocesses and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and our new logo is pending registration in the us the same mark and logo have been registered or are pending registration in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ®  trax ®  trade on ®  liquiditybridge ®  bondticker ®  axess all ®  private axes ®  and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks open trading tm  marketaxess bidask spread index basi tm  midhedging tm and now you’re in the market tm are trademarks we use but they have not been registered or are pending registration in the us

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and also has a secregistered alternative trading system marketaxess corporation is also a member of finra and registered with the msrb selfregulatory organizations that regulate brokerdealers in the us in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary operates as a sef for the trading of certain credit derivatives subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction including certain index swaps subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination that are required to be executed on a sef or regulated exchange 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis have adversely affected our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities which could negatively impact the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union “eu” and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation our principal regulator in the uk is the fca marketaxess europe limited is authorized and regulated by the fca to operate a multilateral trading facility “mtf” and is also authorized as a foreign platform in switzerland hong kong and singapore marketaxess capital limited which acts as matched principal counterparty for open trading transactions on the mtf is authorized and regulated by the fca as an investment firm xtrakter limited “xtrakter” is authorized and regulated as a data reporting service provider with the fca and the netherlands authority for the financial markets “afm” which allows it to operate as the trax ® arm and apa 

 

the securities industry in the member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu measures provide for the mutual recognition of national regulatory agencies and their supervision of investment firms which makes it possible for the grant of a single authorization to be valid throughout the eu currently both marketaxess europe limited and xtrakter provide regulated services to european firms outside of the uk in reliance on a crossborder services passport under mifid  howe ver in march 2017 the uk notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk is currently set to leave the eu on march 29 2019 following brexit our uk subsidiaries will not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market current discussions between the uk and the eu regarding a withdrawal agreement envisage a temporary conti nuation of the existing passporting rights during a limited period following march 29 2019 however we are not able to predict with any certainty if or when the uk and the eu will sign the withdrawal agreement accordingly we have established new subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu following brexit see the risk factor captioned “ the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects ” 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe have recently implemented new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were implemented in 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixedincome instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations will be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

our singapore subsidiary marketaxess singapore pte limited is authorized to operate as a recognized market operator “rmo” and is also a registered platform in switzerland and hong kong our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada company is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada our brazilian subsidiary marketaxess plataforma de negociacao ltda is authorized to provide our platform in brazil under the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil we also provide our platform in other countries pursuant to exemptions from registration under the laws of such countries

 i tem 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business generally

risks related to global economic and market conditions

 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

























any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

 

the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

in march 2017 the uk notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk is currently set to leave the eu on march 29 2019 in its negotiations with the eu the uk is not seeking to maintain continued access to the eu single market following brexit which will lead to the loss of the “passporting” rights for regulated financial services firms to automatically operate throughout the eu this future loss of the existing passport right to the eu will affect us and many of our clients for us it means we will no longer be able to conduct business in the eu through our uk subsidiaries following brexit 

 

current discussions between the uk and the eu regarding a withdrawal agreement however envisage a temporary continuation of the existing passporting rights during a limited period following march 29 2019 we are not able to predict with any certainty if or when the uk and the eu will sign the withdrawal agreement accordingly we have established new subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu following brexit in addition our preparation for brexit involves making changes to the technology underlying out trading platform obtaining regulatory approvals and onboarding of clients to our new eu platform in the event that the uk leaves the eu without a withdrawal agreement in place or our preparations for brexit are insufficient or late the trading system and posttrade services that we provide to our clients in the uk and the eu could be significantly disrupted and as a result our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

 

brexit is expected to significantly affect the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in both the uk and eu and could have a material impact on their economies and the future growth of various industries in particular the ecosystem of the eu financial services industry in which we operate which prior to brexit has been heavily centered in london will become more decentr alized the exit of the uk together with the protracted negotiations around the terms of the exit could significantly impact the business environment in which we and our clients operate increase the cost of conducting business in both the eu and the uk and introduce significant new uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject as we currently conduct business in europe primarily through our uk subsidiaries we will face new regulator y and operational costs and challenges associated with the establishment of new subsidiaries in the eu and the management of a less centralized customer and employee base we could also be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the pound sterling and the uk economy 

 

changes to uk immigration policy are likewise expected occur as a result of brexit and our access to and our ability to compete for and hire skilled employees in both the uk and the eu is expected to become more constrained in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate accordingly the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following brexit 

 

although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of an exit of the uk from the eu or the substance or timeline for any transitional period any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition brexit may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject

 

risks related to operating in the electronic fixedincome trading markets

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as ‘block trades’ and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment

a decline in overall market volumes trading volumes on our platform or in our platform’s market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 











 

















if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide we cannot assure you that any new features and versions will become or remain successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

us federal income tax reform could have an adverse impact on the issuance of new debt in the us

 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law and introduced significant changes to us tax and related laws in addition to a reduction in the us federal tax rate the tax act caps interest deductibility and reduces the incentives for us companies to keep foreign cash outside the us and as such may reduce the levels of new corporate debt issuance in the us

 

prior to the tax act federal tax laws generally provided a strong incentive for us companies to finance their operations with debt rather than equity primarily due to the deductibility of interest on debt financing the tax act limits the deduction for interest expense to 30 of an issuer’s adjusted taxable income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 initially generally keyed to ebitda and later to ebit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2022 possibly resulting in a further increase in the disallowance of interest expense debt incurred prior to the passage of the tax act is not grandfathered while issuers may still consider debt financing a viable funding option the initial reaction to the limitation on interest expense deductibility may be for issuers to consider debt to be less attractive in addition because of the cap on interest expense deductibility in the us issuers may be incentivized to issue debt overseas where an interest deduction may continue to be available and beneficial a decrease in the issuance of new debt by us issuers could over time reduce the size of the secondary market for us bond trading in which we operate 

 

prior to the passage of the tax act earnings of us companies accumulated offshore were generally subject to us tax only when repatriated with an allowance for foreign taxes previously paid the tax act reduced the us corporate tax rate by 40 and created a territorial system of taxation in which most foreign income is permanently exempt from us tax the tax act’s territorial regime removes the “lockout” on overseas earnings of a usparented group allowing redeployment or repatriation of those earnings to be utilized for investments in the us or other parts of the world debt repayment share buybacks dividends and acquisitions the ability for us companies to efficiently deploy overseas earnings in the us may reduce the need for such companies to issue new debt in the us which could over time reduce the size of the secondary market for us bond trading in which we operate

 

 

the tax act could have an adverse impact on the issuance of new debt in the us which could impact the amount of secondary trading volumes in the us bond market while we are unable to ascertain the exact impact of the tax act on new bond issuance compared to other contributing factors  us highgrade and us highyield new issuance d eclined by 10 2  and 429  respectively in 2018 compared to 2017  a ny material decline in secondary trading volumes in the us bond market would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

risks related to competition

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 















many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our operations also include the sale of information and analytical tools under our bondticker ® and trax ® brands and posttrade services such as presettlement trade matching and transaction reporting and transparency services for the european markets there is a high degree of competition in data pricing and posttrade products and services and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge our information products and posttrade and services lines may be threatened by new regulations market trends or technologies that reduce their value if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our businesses financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected

 

risks related to our future levels of business profitability and growth

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform we cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue

 

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we c urrently derive approximately 498  of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business stra tegy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have exper ienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 



























as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets such as our recent entry into the municipal bond and leveraged loan markets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in these and other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

risks related to our geographic and customer concentration

our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate

historically our business operations have been substantially located in the us and the uk while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries such as brexit moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

in the us the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which has adversely affected our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in addition over the past several years there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries and several of our large brokerdealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome products further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform and increasingly to provide liquidity through our open trading protocols a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients also buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

credit and market risks 

we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary 

in connection with our anonymous open trading protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing open trading trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platform clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our electronic platform although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our open trading participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

the fixedincome products that can be traded through our open trading functionality as well as our investments in fixed and variable rate debt financial instruments are subject to significant interestrate and foreign currency exchange rate risks to manage these and the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our riskmanagement methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our riskmanagement methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our riskmanagement policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24houraday global nature of our business 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

 

technology and it systems risks 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our bond reference databases and the clearing and settlement of our open trading transactions disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud computing and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

our computer systems may suffer failures and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients

we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

















in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 















any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

 

in these circumstances if we were unable to execute our disaster recovery plans or our redundant systems and disas ter recovery plans proved insufficient for the particular situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be ce rtain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

it is also a risk that we will not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all such system problems our disaster recovery plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation 

we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity risks

malicious cyberattacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties

the operation of our electronic trading platform relies on the secure processing storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data including confidential client and personal information although we take protective measures such as securityrelated software programs firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our and our customers’ information and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve as a result our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential and personal customer information unavailability or disruption of service computer viruses acts of vandalism or other malicious code cyberattack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact despite the defensive measures we have taken we are subject to threats which may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the third party service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyberattack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure

there have been an increasing number of cyberattacks in recent years in various industries including ours and cybersecurity risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators if one or more cyberattacks occur it could potentially jeopardize the confidential proprietary and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our as well as our customers’ or other third parties’ operations which could result in reputational damage financial losses customer dissatisfaction andor regulatory penalties which may not in all cases be covered by insurance any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks or those of third parties important to our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects

our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats including the assessment of firms’ vulnerability to cyberattacks in particular regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies practices and procedures protecting firm networks and information identifying and addressing risks associated with clients vendors and other third parties preventing and detecting unauthorized activities adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents while any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident may help to prevent our realizing a significant loss from the incident it would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions

 

our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyberattack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security bre aches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information although we intend to cont inue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

intellectual property risks

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 















 

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement cla ims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our product s or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to possible transactions or investments

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic despite our efforts we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

















these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

 

our investments in expanding our information and posttrade services businesse s may not produce substantial revenue or profit 

with respect to our information services and posttrade services businesses we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service even after incurring these costs we ultimately may not sell any or sell only small amounts of these products or services consequently if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion and development initiatives the upfront costs associated with them may exceed the related revenue and reduce our working capital and income

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

risks related to key personnel and employees

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of credit products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

regulatory risks 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the united kingdom the afm in the netherlands the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm and apa with the fca and the afm

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including 













we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered brokerdealer and mtf are subject to us or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from us or our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our authority to operate our platform in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis if at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1 business—government regulation” 

 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiar y which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body 

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business

the financial services industry in general is heavily regulated proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the united states congress in state legislatures and by foreign governments the government agencies that regulate us continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives may adopt new or revised laws and regulations and have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules regulations and industry standards of practice in light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry we are unable to predict which of these proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and that of our clients are also affected by the policies adopted by the federal reserve and international central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our customers or increase the cost for our customers to trade the instruments on our platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for capital raising and inv estment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

in addition regulatory bodies in europe have recently developed new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were implemented in january 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixedincome instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses there is also increasing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection and many jurisdictions have passed laws in this area such as the european union general data protection regulation and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations but they may increase our compliance risk and cost and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development and growth of impacted markets to become impractical for example the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which negatively impacts the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform other regulatory initiatives include basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and liquidity in most of the world’s major economies these rules restrict the ability of our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients to raise additional capital or use existing capital for trading purposes which might cause them to trade less on our platform in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our disclosed trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations compliance and operational costs and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material if we offer a trading methodology subject to oversight under regulation ats in the future such as a central limit order book for the trading of bonds or other similar automated matching services these protocols would likely be regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats which could increase our compliance and operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our businesses 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties   

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results

legal risks

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential or personal information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions

our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures failure to protect their confidential or personal information mismanagement or even fraud we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and the services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to growing our us and international operations

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 









 









our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example mifid ii and mifir were implemented by regulatory bodies in europe in january 2018 we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure 

we cannot predict what future actions that the regulatory bodies that supervise our business might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in addition we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service and the period before the product or service is successfully developed introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years even after incurring these costs our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries outside the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in non us dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our net investment in our uk subsidiaries and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

 

liquidity and funding risks 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

















the growth of our open trading protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “ our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions ” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 1000 million subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 





















 

we ar e also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender u nder the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also ha ve the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit a greement 

 

risks related to our internal controls

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 















most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

 

we may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the fu ture 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or if we continue paying dividends that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods if we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends investors may need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 







provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

critica l factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

 

in 2018 our business faced a mix of trading environments that impacted our market share and trading volumes in the first quarter the trading environment was generally supportive of our business due to a number of factors including increased volatility resulting from the end of quantitative easing in the us and europe higher interest rates and a reduced trading emphasis on new bond issues in favor of the secondary markets in which we operate in the second and third quarters however overall trading conditions were less favorable as credit spreads narrowed volatility declined and there was an increase in the issuance of new highgrade corporate bond issues trading conditions improved considerably in september and the fourth quarter as credit spreads widened and credit spread volatility increased new issue activity was lighter than normal and investment managers experienced significant outflows resulting in increased secondary trading volumes in addition the increase in yields and flattening of the yield curve in 2018 resulted in lower duration of bonds traded on the platform which negatively impacted our fee capture rate 

 

our results of operations are also impacted by the overall level of activity in our core products in 2018 market volumes in the us highgrade market increased 5 compared to 2017 driven by the increased market volatility trade war tensions and the yearoveryear decline of us highgrade new issuance of 10 international demand for us highgrade bonds also declined in 2018 as a result of an increase in foreign exchange hedging costs estimated secondary markets trading volumes for us highyield bonds emerging market bonds and eurobonds however declined compared to 2017 as a slowing global economy lead to wider credit spreads and a greater emphasis on risk reduction as a result secondary market liquidity was tighter which contributed to the yearoveryear market volume decline for these products

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer or alltoall trading platforms competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform total transaction costs and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

 

following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe called for increased regulation and transparency in the overthecounter markets as a result the doddfrank act was enacted in 2010 and among other things mandated the clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or sefs in each case subject to certain key exceptions 

 

 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis have adversely affected our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities which could negatively impact the level of liquidity and pricing avail able on our trading platform for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform  

 

since the presidential election in november 2016 however the us has pursued a path of financial deregulation and has rolled back certain provisions of the doddfrank act there has also been a growing focus on us capital markets regulations as the us department of the treasury issued a report with recommendations to improve corporate bond liquidity and the regulations that implement the volcker rule in 2017 the sec established a fixed income market structure advisory committee in order to provide the sec with diverse perspectives on the structure and operations of the us fixedincome markets as well as advice and recommendations on matters related to fixedincome market structure

in europe mifid ii and mifir were implemented in january 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixedincome instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to an arm iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade services businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

in march 2017 the uk notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk is currently set to leave the eu in march 2019 following brexit our uk subsidiaries will not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market although current discussions between the uk and the eu regarding a transitional period following march 2019 envisage a temporary continuation of the existing passporting rights during such period we have established new subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu following brexit 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between and among our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our disclosed trading transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

other credit commissions other credit includes eurobonds emerging markets bonds highyield bonds and municipal bonds commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules during the third quarter of 2017 we changed our highyield fee plan structure similar to our us highgrade fee plans certain dealers now participate in a highyield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee while other dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

liquid products commissions liquid products includes us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

information services

we generate revenue from data licensed to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services these revenues are either for subscription based services transferred over time or onetime services revenues transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance information services revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 

posttrade services

we generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting trade publication and trade matching services revenues are recognized in the period that the transactions are processed when billed in advance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period we also generate revenue from onetime implementation fees which are recognized in the period the implementation is complete 

other revenue 

other revenue includes revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses

critical accounting policies and estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2018 we adopted revenue from contracts with customers asu 201409 using the modified retrospective approach which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements there were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to those we disclosed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10k as amended for the year ended december 31 2017

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software including among other items employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

for further discussion related to revenue recognition see the preceding “trends in our business” section and note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital effective upon our adoption of asu 201609 on january 1 2017 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu201609” we account for forfeitures as they occur prior to the adoption of asu 201609 expected forfeitures were included in determining sharebased compensation expense

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations effective upon our adoption of asu 201609 all tax effects related to sharebased payments are recorded through tax expense in the periods during which the awards are exercised or vest see note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to income taxes 

 

business comb inations goodwill and intangible assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives

we operate as a single reporting unit subsequent to an acquisition goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit as a result all of the fair value of the company is available to support the value of goodwill an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

 

segment results 

we operate an electronic multiparty platform for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for certain geographic information about our business required by us gaap

  liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally generated funds cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled 4864 million at december 31 2018 

in october 2015 we entered into a twoyear amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” that increased our borrowing capacity to an aggregate of 1000 million in october 2017 we amended the credit agreement and extended the maturity date to october 2018 the amended credit agreement also provided for two additional oneyear extension options and modified certain borrowing terms and covenants in october 2018 we exercised our first option to extend the maturity date to october 2019 subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by an additional 500 million as of december 31 2018 we had 17 million in letters of credit outstanding and 983 million in available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement

during the past three years our cash flows were as follows 



 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 201 7 

the 559 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income of 248 million a decrease in net purchases of corporate debt trading investments of 179 million and a decrease in working capital of 145 million

the 34 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of 220 million offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities availableforsale of 253 million capital expenditures in 2018 included 251 million related to the buildout of our new headquarters in new york city

the 244 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a decrease in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 197 million and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of 173 million offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 135 million 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to year ended december 31 2016 

the 783 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of corporate debt trading investments of 571 million and an increase in net income of 219 million offset by an increase in working capital of 21 million

past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity business and financial condition

nongaap financial measures

we use a nongaap financial measure called “free cash flow” free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments less expenditures for furniture equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs we believe this nongaap financial measure is important in gaining an understanding of our financial strength and cash flow generation

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow as defined for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

 



 

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the uk or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2018 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2018 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 1628 million in excess of the required levels of 150 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator as of december 31 2018 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 933 million 

pursuant to the tax act all previously undistributed earnings have now been subject to us tax notwithstanding the us taxation of these amounts we consider our undistributed foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and do not expect to incur any significant additional taxes related to such amounts

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through thirdparty clearing brokers settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded under securities clearing agreements with third party clearing brokers we maintain collateral deposits with each clearing broker in the form of cash as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the amount of the collateral deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was 11   million and 12 million respectively we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements each thirdparty clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty failure on any of our trades we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to this right for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy

effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2018 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2018 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 1073 million and the fair value of the liability was 10 million 

 

 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018 we had 2360 million of investments in corporate bonds and us treasuries that were classified as securities availableforsale or trading securities adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our business generally – global economic and market conditions – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2018 our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to 4864 million a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease our annual investment income by approximately 48 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2018 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 12 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 12 million would be recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

a similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately 10 million the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 10 million would be recognized in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 

we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we conduct operations in several different countries outside of the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in non us dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

during the year ended december 31 2018 approximately 145 of our revenue and 286 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the british pound sterling based on actual results over the past year a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 63 million and operating expenses by approximately 64 million

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus british pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2018 the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 1073 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

 

credit risk 

two of our subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess capital limited act as a matched principal counterparty in connection with the open trading transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our open trading clients executing bond trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixedincome markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at this bank

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixedincome market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments using our patented trading technology over 1300 institutional investor and brokerdealer firms are active users of our trading platform accessing global liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european bonds us agency bonds municipal bonds credit default swaps and other fixedincome securities through our open trading™ protocols we execute trades in certain bonds between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in an alltoall trading environment on a matched principal basis we also offer a number of tradingrelated products and services including market data to assist clients with trading decisions connectivity solutions that facilitate straightthrough processing technology services to optimize trading environments and execution services for exchangetraded fund managers and other clients through our trax ® division we also offer a range of pre and posttrade services including trade matching trade publication regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome and other products 

 

our platform’s innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics our traditional requestforquote model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond our open trading™ protocols complement our requestforquote model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an alltoall trading environment our platform also provides our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixedincome securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many market participants also use email and other electronic means of communication for trading these securities while electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with traditional bond trading methods we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality addresses many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone or via email through our rfq trading protocols our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery and then trade those securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our bondticker ® service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from all of our participating brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and 

 

a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultan eously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which f acilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact directly with each other however in connection with our open trading™ protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker in 2017 159 of all marketaxess platform volume was executed via open trading™ protocols up from 132 in the 2016

according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” outstanding us highgrade corporate bond debt has increased approximately 249 from yearend 2012 to september 30 2017 the most recent date available during this same period financial market regulators have implemented increased capital requirements for bankowned brokerdealers holding corporate bond inventory as a result corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined partly as a result of these trends overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover we have responded with a series of open trading tm protocols designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2017 over 700 participating client firms provided liquidity via our open trading™ solutions and we completed approximately 628000 open trading™ trades an increase of 539 compared to 2016

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 82 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2017 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bond volume is traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

in 2017 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 169 of the total estimated us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

through our trax ® brand we provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services for european investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products in response to the preand posttrade transparency mandates from the recast markets in financial instruments directive “mifid ii” in europe trax ® has been authorized by the uk financial conduct authority “fca” as an approved publication arrangement “apa” and an approved reporting mechanism “arm” in addition to its apa and arm reporting services trax ® has developed a comprehensive suite of valueadd solutions for mifid ii including pre trade transparency services systematic internaliser “si” determination and monitoring best execution reporting commodity position reporting data quality analysis and peer benchmarking

in 2017 894 of our revenues were derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information services posttrade services investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2017 the most recent date available there were approximately 403 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 88 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to sifma the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds as measured by trace was 278 billion in 2017 

 

primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 126 billion as of december 31 2017 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k 

the us highgrade corporate bond market represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market finra includes over 60000 unique securities in the list of traceeligible bonds representing the majority of the daily trading volume of highgrade bonds according to sifma us highgrade corporate bond debt outstanding has increased approximately 249 from 70 trillion at yearend 2012 to 88 trillion at september 30 2017 over the last five years highgrade corporate bond issuance was over 10 trillion each year exceeding prefinancial crisis levels notwithstanding the growth in the total amount of debt outstanding turnover which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding for the bonds that traded is below creditcrisis lows the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace increased to approximately 49 trillion for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 46 trillion and 40 trillion for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we believe that the low level of turnover is an indicator of liquidity challenges in the credit markets

prior to regulatory reforms such as basel iii and regulations under the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” dealer balance sheets were relatively elastic so dealers were able to facilitate trading in most fixedincome products without dramatic price moves the regulatory reforms enacted after the global financial crisis resulted in greater capital and liquidity requirements for dealers which impacted market liquidity and diminished risk appetite by market intermediaries the volcker rule which limits proprietary trading by banks has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as marketmakers as a result we believe market participants require new solutions to increase liquidity and we have responded with our open trading™ protocols designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform by allowing our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment

emerging markets bond market

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2017 the most recent date available was 102 billion of external markets debt and 117 billion of local markets debt 

us crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investmentgrade by one agency but investmentgrade by the other  the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma increased by 189 to 2849 billion in 2017 from 2396 billion in 2016 primarily due to increased global demand for higher yielding debt the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2017 was approximately 82 billion

european corporate bond market 

the european corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 



 







we believe that the european corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market the total amount of euro denominated highgrade and highyield bonds yearly issuance as reported by international capital markets association increased by 146 to 4474 billion in 2017 from 3904 billion in 2016 the average daily trading volume of european corporate bonds as estimated by trax ® for the year ended december 31 2017 was approximately 87 billion 

us agency bond market 

we define the us agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 19 trillion as of september 30 2017 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of us agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace decreased from approximately 51 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 to 38 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 

us municipal bond market 

municipal bonds are debt securities issued by states cities counties and other governmental entities in the us to fund daytoday obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects such as highways or water systems depending on the type of financing payments of the principal and interest on a municipal bond may come from general revenues of the municipal issuer specific tax receipts revenues generated from a public project or payments from private entities or from a combination of sources in addition to being issued for many different purposes municipal securities are also issued in many different forms such as fixed rate zero coupon or variable rate bonds the interest paid on municipal securities is typically exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes as well as of december 31 2017 there were over one million different municipal bonds outstanding in the total aggregate principal amount of more than 38 trillion in 2017 the average daily trading volume of municipal bonds as measured by the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” decreased to 55 billion from approximately 74 billion for the year ended december 31 2016

credit derivative market 

credit derivatives are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions we operate a swap execution facility pursuant to the us commodity futures trading commission’s “cftc” rules and we list certain credit derivatives for trading by us persons and other participants on our sef the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs that would govern the execution of singlename credit derivatives nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules according to the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” the average daily trading volume of index credit derivative swaps for 2017 decreased to 271 billion from approximately 288 billion the year ended december 31 2016

trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting and publishing services 

in europe the first mifid set bestexecution requirements for trades and mandated that financial firms submit to their local regulators detailed endofday reports including the time and price of a trade the counterparty involved and whether it was a purchase or sale firms must either become socalled approved reporting mechanisms “arms” or use one of the approved providers  such as our trax ® arm to submit such reports  in the uk required transactions are reported to the financial conduct authority “fca” mifid ii significantly increased the number of fields that must be reported to regulators 

trax ® was also approved by the fca as an apa for transparency and reporting services under the mifid ii regime the trax transparency solution which includes the apa is available through the trax insight™ platform and offers our clients a pre and posttrade transparency solution including quote publication si determination and instrument liquidity classification

 

trade matching enables counterparties to agree on the terms of a trade shortly after execution reducing the risk of errors and a trade failing during settlement trax match is our near realtime posttrade matching and exception management tool which covers a broad range of securities including fixed income and equities trax match helps our clients to mitigate their operational risk improve straightthrough processing “stp” and efficiency address the complexities o f mifid ii and the central securities depositories regulation and c onfirm all economic details within minutes of execution 

our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to many of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 







we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of over 1300 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients and their ability to use our open trading™ protocols to help manage their risk source liquidity and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients 

as shown in the chart below our total bond trading volume increased from 6937 billion in 2013 to almost 15 trillion in 2017 

 

our adjusted estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume for 2017 was approximately 169 and 68 respectively our estimated market share from 2013 to 2017 is shown in the chart below 

 

 we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 because we believe that the trace volume as adjusted by us provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting 

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is approximately 9 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 800 we believe our open trading tm protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading tm participants to interact in an alltoall trading environment thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our bondticker ® service eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

limited information leakage our open trading tm protocols allow our institutional investor clients to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation through to settlement without limiting their number of potential trading counterparties in addition our private axes ® protocol allows participants to negotiate bilaterally on an anonymous basis to minimize information leakage when transacting in larger trade sizes 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had 

 

access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforwar d trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

transparent pricing on a range of securities institutional investors and brokerdealer clients can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of market participants who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to other participants who may respond with executable prices within the time period specified by the requestor through our open trading™ protocols participants may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to increase the amount of crossregional activity by our institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform subject to regulatory requirements 

leverage our existing client network and technology to increase counterparties and improve liquidity 

due to regulatory changes that have caused significant reductions in primary dealer corporate bond balance sheets our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients need new and innovative electronic trading solutions to promote secondary market liquidity we intend to continue to develop and deploy a wide range of electronic trading protocols to complement our traditional requestforquote model these open trading™ protocols increase potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2017 our clients executed approximately 628000 trades using our open trading™ solutions

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently for example in recent years we expanded our platform to the municipal bond and leveraged loan markets

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings 

we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we expect to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we also plan to expand and enhance the trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services provided by trax ® in europe to enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to mifid ii

pursue select acquisitions and strategic alliances 

we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients for example the acquisition of xtrakter limited “xtrakter” in february 2013 provided us with an expanded 

 

set of technology solutions ahead of incoming preand posttrade transparency mandates from mifid ii in europe in recent years we entered into and expanded a strategic a lliance with blackrock inc “blackrock” to combine blackrock’s order flow with our open trading™ solution to improve the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants

straightthrough processing and apis

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and 

 

institu tional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through t hese partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations 

usage of our straightthrough processing tools increased significantly during the last several years we maintained over 1100 investor client stp connections as of december 31 2017 in addition many of our brokerdealer clients use our application programming interfaces “api” services for pretrade trade negotiation and posttrade services to improve efficiency and reduce errors in processing 

sales and marketing 

we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force is responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our trading platform and information and posttrade services by our existing clients their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use our system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixedincome trading platform we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing promotional mailings and participation in industry conferences and media engagement to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform for example we have worked with the wall street journal to establish bondticker ® as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and highyield tables a similar process also exists for our trax ® posttrade business employing both direct and indirect sales methods 

competition 

the industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 









competitors including companies in which some of our clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore some of our clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 



 















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to use our services 

furthermore a significant number of our institutional investor firms have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor firms on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ®  trax ®  trade on ®  liquiditybridge ®  bondticker ®  axess all ®  axess 50 ®  private axes ®  and 

 

associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks open trading tm and marketaxess bidask spread index basi tm are trademarks we use but they have not been registered 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and an alternative trading system operator it is also a member of finra and registered with the msrb selfregulatory organizations that regulate brokerdealers in the us in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary operates as a sef for the trading of certain credit derivatives subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction including certain index swaps subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination that are required to be executed on a sef or regulated exchange the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union “eu” and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation our principal regulator in the uk is the fca marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility “mtf” with the fca and is also a registered platform in switzerland hong kong and singapore xtrakter is registered as an arm and apa with the fca and also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

the securities industry in the member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the eu as an fca approved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization in march 2017 the uk notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk is currently set to leave the eu in march 2019 depending on the terms agreed between eu member states and the uk as part of the exit negotiations our uk subsidiaries may not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market accordingly we have begun the process of establishing one or more new regulated subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu following brexit 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe have recently developed new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” were implemented in january 2018 and introduced significant changes in 

 

market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii and mifir may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platfor m in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology re sources to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations will be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

our singapore subsidiary marketaxess singapore pte limited is authorized to operate as a recognized market operator “rmo” and is also a registered platform in switzerland and hong kong our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada company is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada our brazilian subsidiary marketaxess platforma de negociacao ltda is authorized to provide our platform in brazil under the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil we also provide our platform in other countries pursuant to exemptions from registration under the laws of such countries

 i tem 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business generally

risks related to global economic and market conditions

 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

























any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

 

the uk exit from the european union could materially adversely impact our business clients financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

in march 2017 the uk notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk is currently set to leave the eu in march 2019 in its negotiations with the eu the uk is not seeking to maintain continued access to the eu single market following brexit which will lead to the loss of the “passporting” rights for regulated financial services firms to automatically operate throughout the eu this future loss of the existing passport right to the eu will affect us and many of our clients for us it means we will no longer be able to conduct business in the eu through our uk subsidiaries following brexit 

 

current discussions between the uk and the eu regarding a transitional period following march 2019 envisage a temporary continuation of the existing passporting rights during such period however we are not able to predict with any certainty whether the uk and the eu will be able to agree to a transitional period which laws and policies will apply during any such transitional period whether we would be able to rely on the existing “passporting regime” during a transitional period or the length of such period accordingly we have begun the process of establishing new regulated subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu following brexit 

 

brexit is expected to significantly affect the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in both the uk and eu and could have a material impact on their economies and the future growth of various industries in particular the ecosystem of the eu financial services industry in which we operate which prior to brexit has been heavily centered in london will become more decentralized the exit of the uk together with the protracted negotiations around the terms of the exit could significantly impact 

 

the business environment in which we and our clients operate increase the cost of conducting business in both the eu and the uk and introd uce significant new uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject as we currently conduct business in europe primarily through our uk subsidiaries we will face new regulatory and operational costs and challenges associated with the establishment of new regulated subsidiaries in the eu and the management of a customer and employee base that is less centralized in london we could also be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volati lity in the pound sterling and the uk economy 

 

changes to uk immigration policy are likewise expected occur as a result of brexit and our access to and our ability to compete for and hire skilled employees in both the uk and the eu is expected to become more constrained in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate accordingly the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following brexit 

 

although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of an exit of the uk from the eu or the substance or timeline for any transitional period any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition brexit may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject

risks related to operating in the electronic fixedincome trading markets

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as ‘block trades’ and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment

a decline in overall market volumes trading volumes on our platform or in our platform’s market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 















 













if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide we cannot assure you that any new features and versions will become or remain successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

us federal income tax reform could have an adverse impact on the issuance of new debt in the us

 

in december 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” was enacted into law and introduced significant changes to us tax and related laws in addition to a reduction in the us federal tax rate the tax act caps interest deductibility and reduces the incentives for us companies to keep foreign cash outside the us and as such may reduce the levels of new corporate debt issuance in the us

 

prior to the tax act federal tax laws generally provided a strong incentive for us companies to finance their operations with debt rather than equity primarily due to the deductibility of interest on debt financing the tax act limits the deduction for interest expense to 30 of an issuer’s adjusted taxable income for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 initially generally keyed to ebitda and later to ebit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2022 possibly resulting in a further increase in the disallowance of interest expense debt incurred prior to the passage of the tax act is not grandfathered while issuers may still consider debt financing a viable funding option the initial reaction to the limitation on interest expense deductibility may be for issuers to consider debt to be less attractive in addition because of the cap on interest expense deductibility in the us issuers may be incentivized to issue debt overseas where an interest deduction may continue to be available and beneficial a decrease in the issuance of new debt by us issuers could over time reduce the size of the secondary market for us bond trading in which we operate 

 

prior to the passage of the tax act earnings of us companies accumulated offshore were generally subject to us tax only when repatriated with an allowance for foreign taxes previously paid the tax act reduced the us corporate tax rate by 40 and created a territorial system of taxation in which most foreign income is permanently exempt from us tax the tax act’s territorial regime removes the “lockout” on overseas earnings of a usparented group allowing redeployment or repatriation of those earnings to be utilized for investments in the us or other parts of the world debt repayment share buybacks dividends and acquisitions accumulated foreign earnings for multinational corporate groups that have deferred the us tax liability are now subject to taxation at a special onetime rate of 155 or less the ability for us companies to efficiently deploy overseas earnings in the us may reduce the need for such companies to issue new debt in the us which could over time reduce the size of the secondary market for us bond trading in which we operate

 

 

the tax act could have an adverse impact on the issuance of new debt in the us which could impact the amount of secondary trading volumes in the us bond market  while we are unable to predict the impact of the tax act any material decline in secondary trading volumes in the us bond market would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

 

risks related to competition

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 















many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our operations also include the sale of information and analytical tools under our bondticker ® and trax ® brands and posttrade services such as presettlement trade matching and transaction reporting and transparency services for the european markets there is a high degree of competition in data pricing and posttrade products and services and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge our information products and posttrade and services lines may be threatened by new regulations market trends or technologies that reduce their value if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our businesses financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected

 

risks related to our future levels of business profitability and growth

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform we cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue

 

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 508 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you t hat our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to gr ow at a similar rate if at all 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 



























as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets such as our recent entry into the municipal bond and leveraged loan markets however we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in these and other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than 

 

expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

risks related to our geographic and customer concentration

our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate

historically our business operations have been substantially located in the us and the uk while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries such as brexit moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

in the us the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in addition there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years moreover several of our large brokerdealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome in recent years further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 122 142 and 153 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively based on information filed with the sec by this institutional investor client as of december 31 2017 investment funds managed by this institutional investor client beneficially owned approximately 83 of the outstanding shares of our common stock primarily through passive index and etf funds 

the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

credit and market risks 

we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary 

in connection with our anonymous open trading ™ protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing open trading ™ trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platform clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our electronic platform although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our open trading™ participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

to manage the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our riskmanagement methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our riskmanagement methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our riskmanagement policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24houraday global nature of our business 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

 

technology and it systems risks 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our bond reference databases and the clearing and settlement of our open trading ™ transactions disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors cloud computing and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no 

 

guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance t heir own operations and use of technology 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

our computer systems may suffer failures and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients

we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

















in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 















 

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service co uld damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

in these circumstances if we were unable to execute our disaster recovery plans or our redundant systems and disaster recovery plans proved insufficient for the particular situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

it is also a risk that we will not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all such system problems our disaster recovery plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation 

we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity risks

malicious cyberattacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties

the operation of our electronic trading platform relies on the secure processing storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data including confidential client and personal information although we take protective measures such as securityrelated software programs firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our and our customers’ information and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve as a result our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential customer personal information unavailability or disruption of service computer viruses acts of vandalism or other malicious code cyberattack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact despite the defensive measures we have taken these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the third party service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyberattack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure

there have been an increasing number of cyberattacks in recent years in various industries including ours and cybersecurity risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators if one or more cyberattacks occur it could potentially jeopardize the confidential proprietary and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our as well as our customers’ or other thi rd parties’ operations which could result in reputational damage financial losses customer dissatisfaction andor regulatory penalties which may not in all cases by covered by insurance any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks or those of third parties important to our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects

our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats including the assessment of firms’ vulnerability to cyberattacks in particular regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies practices and procedures protecting firm networks and information identifying and addressing risks associated with clients vendors and other third parties preventing and detecting unauthorized activities adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents while any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident may help to prevent our realizing a significant loss from the incident it would not protect us from the effects of 

 

adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions 

our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyberattack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

intellectual property risks

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 













 



we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to possible transactions or investments

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

















these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

 

our investments in expanding our information and posttrade services businesses may not produce substantial revenue or profit 

with respect to our information and posttrade services businesses we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service even after incurring these costs we ultimately may not sell any or sell only small amounts of these products or services consequently if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion and development initiatives the upfront costs associated with them may exceed the related revenue and reduce our working capital and income

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

risks related to key personnel and employees

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of credit products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

regulatory risks 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the united kingdom the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm and apa with the fca

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including 













we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered brokerdealer and mtf are subject to us or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the us or our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our authority to operate our platform in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis if at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1 business—government regulation” 

 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes i n control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the app licable regulatory body 

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business

the financial services industry in general is heavily regulated proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the united states congress in state legislatures and by foreign governments the government agencies that regulate us continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives may adopt new or revised laws and regulations and have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules regulations and industry standards of practice in light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry we are unable to predict which of these proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and that of our clients are also affected by the policies adopted by the federal reserve and international central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our customers or increase the cost for our customers to trade the instruments on our platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for capital raising and investment activities and may imp act the value of financial instruments we hold changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

in addition regulatory bodies in europe have recently developed new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were implemented in january 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii and mifir may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations but they may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development and growth of impacted markets to become impractical for example the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform other regulatory initiatives include basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and liquidity in most of the world’s major economies by 2019 the implementation of these rules could restrict the ability of our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients to raise additional capital or use existing capital for trading purposes which might cause them to trade less on our platform in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our disclosed trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations compliance and operational costs and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material if we offer a trading methodology subject to oversight under regulation ats in the future such as a central limit order book for the trading of bonds or other similar automated matching services these protocols would likely be regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats which could increase our compliance and operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our businesses 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties   

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results

legal risks

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential or personal information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions

our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures failure to protect to their confidential or personal information mismanagement or even fraud we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to growing our us and international operations

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 









 









our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example mifid ii and mifir were implemented by regulatory bodies in europe in january 2018 we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure 

we cannot predict what future actions that the regulatory bodies that supervise our business might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in addition we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service and the period before the product or service is successfully developed introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years even after incurring these costs our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries outside the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in non us dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our net investment in our uk subsidiaries and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

 

liquidity and funding risks 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

















the growth of our open trading™ protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 1000 million subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 

















 





we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

 

risks related to our internal controls 

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 















most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or if we continue paying dividends that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods if we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends investors may need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 







provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer clients 

in 2017 our business faced a challenging trading environment which we attribute to a number of factors including low volatility low credit spreads and a continuation of accommodative monetary policies by several major central banks including the federal reserve and the european central bank these monetary policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across most of the fixed income markets resulting in a trading emphasis on new bond issues rather than the secondary markets in which we operate the lack of volatility in 2017 particularly weighed on highyield trading activity while emerging market trading volumes benefitted from the global search for yield the global credit markets have also faced structural issues in recent years such as trading limits imposed by the volcker rule increased bank capital requirements under basel iii and the quantitative easing program of the european central bank

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer or alltoall trading platforms competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform total transaction costs and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

 

following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe called for increased regulation and transparency in the overthecounter markets as a result the doddfrank act was enacted in 2010 and among other things mandated the clearing of certain derivative instruments “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions 

 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could also adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations

 

 

following president trump’s election in november 2016 his administration pursued a path of financial deregulation including by signing an executive order that requires the treasury department to review the provisions of the doddfrank act as a result the treasury department has b egun a process of reviewing existing us capital markets regulations including the volcker rule and has issued a report with recommendations to improve corporate bond liquidity in 2017 the sec established a fixed income market structure advisory comm ittee in order to provide the sec with diverse perspectives on the structure and operations of the us fixed income markets as well as advice and recommendations on matters related to fixed income market structure 

in europe mifid ii and mifir were implemented in january 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data mifid ii has caused us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

in march 2017 the uk notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu by invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk is currently set to leave the european union in march 2019 depending on the terms agreed between eu member states and the uk as part of the exit negotiations our uk subsidiaries may not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market accordingly we have begun the process of establishing one or more new regulated subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu following brexit

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between and among our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform 

other credit commissions other credit includes eurobonds emerging markets bonds highyield bonds and municipal bonds commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules during the third quarter of 2017 we changed our highyield fee plan structure similar to our us highgrade fee plans certain dealers now participate in a highyield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee certain dealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments prior to the fee plan change our highyield fee plan options generally consisted solely of variable transaction fees during the fourth quarter of 2016 our eurobond fee plan structure was changed to contain standardized minimum monthly commitments and variable transaction fees prior to the fee plan change our european fee plans generally incorporated some combination of monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

liquid products commissions liquid products includes us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenues from information services posttrade services investment income and other income 

information services we generate revenue from data licensed to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually revenues from information services are recognized in the period the services are provided when billed in advance information service revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis revenue from professional and consulting services are recognized as services are performed and software license subscription revenue and maintenance and support services are recognized ratably over the period 

posttrade services we generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services revenues are recognized in the period the services are provided 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include revenue from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients realized and unrealized gains or losses on trading security investments and other miscellaneous revenues 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease 

 

intangi ble assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform information and posttrade services products and other services 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information and posttrade services 

clearing costs clearing costs consist of fees that we are charged by thirdparty clearing brokers for the clearing and settlement of matched principal trades 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors’ expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts foreign currency transaction gains losses and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

expenses may grow in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion we also expect occupancy expense to increase in 2018 as a result of the new office space for our global headquarters in new york city see item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our properties however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software including among other items employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two matched principal trades fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly 

information services we generate revenue from data licensed to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided revenue from professional consulting services is recognized as services are performed and software license subscription revenue and maintenance and support services are recognized ratably over the contract period 

posttrade services we generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting and trade matching services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital effective upon our adoption of asu 201609 on january 1 2017 “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu201609” we account for forfeitures are recognized as they occur prior to the adoption of asu 201609 expected forfeitures were included in determining sharebased compensation expense

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations effective upon our adoption of asu 201609 all tax effects related to sharebased payments are recorded through tax expense in the periods during which the awards are exercised or vest

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives

we operate as a single reporting unit subsequent to an acquisition goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit as a result all of our fair value is available to support the value of goodwill an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

 

segment results 

we operate an electronic multiparty platform for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for certain geographic information about our business required by us gaap

provision for income tax the 136 million increase in the tax provision was primarily attributable to higher pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 was 341 compared to 351 for the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease was principally due to a higher percentage of income attributable to lower tax jurisdictions and a reduction in certain statutory foreign and state tax rates our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates 

 

as of december 31 2016 we had restricted us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 54 million the utilization of our restricted us federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation determined by section 382 of the internal revenue code 

quarterly results of operations

the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly income statement data for the eight quarters ended december 31 2017 in our opinion this unaudited information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our annual financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the unaudited quarterly data this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that we may achieve for any subsequent periods 

 



 

 

the following tables set forth trading volume and average variable transaction fee per million traded for the eight quarters ended december 31 2017 

 



 



  liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally generated funds free cash flow for the three years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 1596 million 1454 million and 1091 million respectively see below cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled 4065 million at december 31 2017 

in october 2015 we entered into a twoyear amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” that increased our borrowing capacity to an aggregate of 1000 million in october 2017 we amended the credit agreement and extended the maturity date to october 2018 the amended credit agreement also provides for two additional oneyear extension options and modified certain borrowing terms and covenants subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by an additional 500 million as of december 31 2017 we had 09 million in letters of credit outstanding and 991 million in available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement

during the past three years our cash flows were as follows 

 



 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to year ended december 31 2016 

the 783 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of corporate debt trading investments of 571 million and an increase in net income of 219 million offset by an increase in working capital of 21 million

the 05 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of 71 million offset by an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities availableforsale of 71 million

the 518 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an increase in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 225 million an increase in repurchases of our common stock of 185 million and an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 104 million 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to year ended december 31 2015 

the 348 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in corporate debt trading investments of 742 million offset by an increase in net income of 301 million and a decrease in working capital of 52 million

the 152 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to an increase in purchases of securities availableforsale of 243 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 31 million offset by proceeds from sales and maturities and other investing activities of 122 million 

the 99 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 90 million and an increase in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 07 million 

nongaap financial measures

in addition to cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap we use a nongaap financial measure called “free cash flow” free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities excluding net purchases of corporate debt trading investments less expenditures for furniture equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs we believe this nongaap financial measure is important in gaining an understanding of our financial strength and cash flow generation

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow as defined for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

 



other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

 

certain of our us subsidiarie s are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require a s ignificant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the uk or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2017 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2017 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 1305 million in excess of the required levels of 148 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator as of december 31 2017 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 582 million 

pursuant to the tax act all previously undistributed earnings have now been subject to us tax notwithstanding the us taxation of these amounts we consider our undistributed foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and do not expect to incur any significant additional taxes related to such amounts

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through thirdparty clearing brokers settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 revenues from matched principal trading were approximately 457   million 377 million and 169 million respectively under securities clearing agreements with third party clearing brokers we maintain collateral deposits with each clearing broker in the form of cash as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the amount of the collateral deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was 12   million and 11 million respectively for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 clearing expenses associated with matched principal transactions were 58 million 61 million and 33 million respectively and are classified under clearing costs on the consolidated statements of operations we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements each thirdparty clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty failure on any of our trades we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to this right for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 

in the normal course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy

effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractua l obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2017 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows resulting from the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 851 million and the fair value of the liability was 07 million 

 

 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclo sures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017 we had 2364 million of investments in corporate bonds that were classified as securities availableforsale or trading securities adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our business generally – global economic and market conditions – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2017 our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to 4034 million a hypothetical five basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease our annual pretax earnings by approximately 02 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2017 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 12 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 12 million would be recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

a similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately 09 million the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 09 million would be recognized in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 

we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we conduct operations in several different countries outside of the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in non us dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

during the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 127 of our revenue and 284 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the british pound sterling based on actual results over the past year a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 50 million and operating expenses by approximately 56 million

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus british pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 851 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

 

credit risk 

two of our subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess capital limited act as a matched principal counterparty in connection with the open trading ™ transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our open trading ™ clients executing bond trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at this bank

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixedincome market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments using our patented trading technology over 1200 institutional investor and brokerdealer firms are active users of our trading platform accessing global liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european bonds us agency bonds municipal bonds credit default swaps and other fixedincome securities through our open trading™ protocols we execute trades in certain bonds between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in an alltoall trading environment on a matched principal basis we also offer a number of tradingrelated products and services including market data to assist clients with trading decisions connectivity solutions that facilitate straightthrough processing technology services to optimize trading environments and execution services for exchangetraded fund managers and other clients through our trax® division we also offer a range of pre and posttrade services including trade matching regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome and other products 

 

our platform’s innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics our traditional requestforquote model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond our open trading™ protocols complement our requestforquote model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an alltoall trading environment our platform also provides our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixedincome securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many market participants also use email and other electronic means of communication for trading these securities while electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with traditional bond trading methods we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality addresses many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone or via email through our rfq trading protocols our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery and then trade those securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from all of our participating brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price 

differential of t he bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact directly with each other however in connection with our open trading™ protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker in 2016 132 of all marketaxess platform volume was executed via open trading™ protocols up from 92 in the 2015

according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” outstanding us highgrade corporate bond debt has increased approximately 214 from yearend 2012 to september 30 2016 the most recent date available during this same period financial market regulators have implemented increased capital requirements for bankowned brokerdealers holding corporate bond inventory as a result corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined partly as a result of these trends overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover we have responded with a series of open trading tm protocols designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2016 over 600 participating client firms provided liquidity via our open trading™ solutions and we completed approximately 407000 open trading™ trades an increase of 130 compared to 2015

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 82 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2016 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bond volume is traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

in 2016 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 16 of the total estimated us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

through our trax ® brand we provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services for european securities and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products trax ® provides the company with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming preand posttrade transparency mandates from the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” ii in europe 

in 2016 90 of our revenues were derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2016 the most recent date available there were approximately 408 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 86 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to sifma the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds as measured by trace was 268 billion in 2016 primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 95 billion as of december 31 2016 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k 

the us highgrade corporate bond market represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market finra includes over 53000 unique securities in the list of traceeligible bonds representing the majority of the daily trading volume of highgrade bonds according to sifma us highgrade corporate bond debt outstanding has increased approximately 214 from 70 trillion at yearend 2012 to 86 trillion at september 30 2016 over the last five years highgrade corporate bond issuance was over 10 trillion each year exceeding prefinancial crisis levels notwithstanding the growth in the total amount of debt outstanding turnover which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding for the bonds that traded is below creditcrisis lows the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace increased to approximately 46 trillion for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 40 trillion and 37 trillion for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we believe that the low level of turnover is an indicator of liquidity challenges in the credit markets

prior to regulatory reforms such as basel iii and regulations under the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” dealer balance sheets were relatively elastic so dealers were able to facilitate trading in most fixedincome products without dramatic price moves the regulatory reforms enacted after the global financial crisis resulted in greater capital and liquidity requirements for dealers which impacted market liquidity and diminished risk appetite by market intermediaries the volcker rule which limits proprietary trading by banks has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as effective marketmakers as a result we believe market participants require new solutions to increase liquidity and we have responded with our open trading™ protocols designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform by allowing our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment

emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2016 the most recent date available was 78 billion of external markets debt and 137 billion of local markets debt 

us crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investmentgrade by one agency but investmentgrade by the other  the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma decreased by 96 to 2366 billion in 2016 from 2617 billion in 2015 primarily due to risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2016 was approximately 85 billion

european corporate bond market 

the european corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 











we believe that the european corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market the total amount of euro denominated highgrade and highyield bonds yearly issuance as reported by international capital markets association increased by 47 to 3904 billion in 2016 from 3730 billion in 2015 the average daily trading volume of european corporate bonds as estimated by trax ® for the year ended december 31 2016 was approximately 82 billion 

us agency bond market 

we define the us agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 20 trillion as of september 30 2016 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of us agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace increased from approximately 50 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 to 51 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 

us municipal bond market 

municipal bonds are debt securities issued by states cities counties and other governmental entities in the us to fund daytoday obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects such as highways or water systems depending on the type of financing payments of the principal and interest on a municipal bond may come from general revenues of the municipal issuer specific tax receipts revenues generated from a public project or payments from private entities or from a combination of sources in addition to being issued for many different purposes municipal securities are also issued in many different forms such as fixed rate zero coupon or variable rate bonds the interest paid on municipal securities is typically exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes as well as of december 31 2016 there were over one million different municipal bonds outstanding in the total aggregate principal amount of more than 38 trillion the average daily trading volume of municipal bonds as measured by the municipal securities rulemaking board “msrb” for the year ended december 31 2016 was approximately 74 billion

credit derivative market 

credit derivatives are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions we operate a swap execution facility pursuant to the us commodity futures trading commission’s “cftc” rules and we list certain credit derivatives for trading by us persons and other participants on our sef the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs that would govern the execution of singlename credit derivatives nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules according to the depository trust  clearing corporation trade information warehouse the average daily trading volume of credit derivatives for the year ended december 31 2016 was approximately 823 billion

trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services 

in europe the first mifid set bestexecution requirements for trades and mandated that financial firms submit to their local regulators detailed endofday reports including the time and price of a trade the counterparty involved and whether it was a purchase or sale firms must either become socalled approved reporting mechanisms “arms” or use one of the approved providers  such as our trax ® arm to submit such reports  in the uk required transactions are reported to the financial conduct authority “fca” mifid ii will increase the number of fields that must be reported to regulators and we expect the demand for experienced regulatory trade reporting service providers to increase over the next several years 

trade matching enables counterparties to agree the terms of a trade shortly after execution reducing the risk of errors and a trade failing during settlement in 2014 the central securities depositories regulation shortened the securities settlement cycle for all cash securities including corporate bonds across the european union “eu” to no later than two days after the date on which a trade is executed referred to as a t2 settlement cycle with a shortened settlement cycle firms use trade matching services such as our trax ® match service in europe to match trade details on trade date and reduce both operational and settlement risk 

our competitive strength s 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to many of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 







we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of over 1200 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients 

as shown in the chart below our total bond trading volume increased from 5896 billion in 2012 to 13 trillion in 2016 

  

our adjusted estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume for 2016 was approximately 160 and 70 respectively our estimated market share from 2012 to 2016 is shown in the chart below 

 

 

 we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 because we believe that the trace volume as adjusted by us provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting we have provided a reconciliation of the reported us highgrade trace volumes to the adjusted us highgrade trace volumes in the “investor relations” section of our website

 

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is approximately 9 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 80000 we believe our open trading tm protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading tm participants to interact in an alltoall trading environment thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our bondticker tm service eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

limited information leakage our open trading tm protocols allow our institutional investor clients to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation through to settlement without limiting their number of potential trading counterparties in addition our private axes tm protocol allows participants to negotiate bilaterally on an anonymous basis to minimize information leakage when transacting in larger trade sizes 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

transparent pricing on a range of securities institutional investors and brokerdealer clients can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of market participants who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to other participants who may respond with executable prices within the time period specified by the requestor through our open trading™ protocols participants may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasing ly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance per sonnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valua ble source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate tha t they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to increase the amount of crossregional activity by our institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform subject to regulatory requirements 

leverage our existing client network and technology to increase counterparties and improve liquidity 

due to regulatory changes that have caused significant reductions in primary dealer corporate bond balance sheets our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients need new and innovative electronic trading solutions to promote secondary market liquidity we intend to continue to develop and deploy a wide range of electronic trading protocols to complement our traditional requestforquote model these open trading™ protocols increase potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2016 our clients executed approximately 407000 trades using our open trading™ solutions

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently for example during 2016 we expanded our platform to the municipal bond and leveraged loan markets

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings 

we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we expect to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we also plan to expand and enhance the trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services provided by trax ® in europe to enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to mifid ii

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations

sales and marketing 

we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force is responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our trading platform and information and posttrade services by our 

existing clients their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use our system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixedincome trading platform we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing promotional mailings and participation in industry co nferences and media engagement to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform for example we have worked with the wall street journal to establish bondticker tm as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and highyi eld tables a similar process also exists for our trax ® posttrade business employing both direct and indirect sales methods 

competition 

the industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 









competitors including companies in which some of our clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore some of our clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore a significant number of our institutional investor firms have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor firms on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ®  trax ®  trade on ®  liquiditybridge ®  bondticker ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks open trading tm  axess all tm  openaxess tm  private axes tm and marketaxess bidask spread index   basi tm are trademarks we use but they have not been registered

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regul ation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and an alternative trading system operator it is also a member of finra and registered with the municipal securities rulemaking board selfregulatory organizations that regulate brokerdealers in the us in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary operates as a sef for the trading of certain credit derivatives subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction including certain index swaps subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination that are required to be executed on a sef or regulated exchange the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the eu and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation our principal regulator in the uk is the fca marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility “mtf” with the fca and is also a registered platform in switzerland hong kong and singapore xtrakter is registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fca and also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

the securities industry in the member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the eu as an fca approved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization in june 2016 the uk voted in an advisory referendum to leave the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk government has not yet delivered an official notice of withdrawal however depending on the terms negotiated between eu member states and the uk following brexit our uk subsidiaries may not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market as a result we may need to establish one or more new regulated subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” were approved in june 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while some of the technical advice underpinning mifid ii have not yet been finalized mifid ii will have a significant impact in these areas as well as on corporate governance and investor protection mifid ii and mifir are expected to take effect in january 2018 the final rules may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations will be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada company is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada our brazilian subsidiary marketaxess platforma de negociacao ltda is authorized to provide our platform in brazil under the jurisdiction of the securities

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

























any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as ‘block trades’ and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment

a decline in trading volumes on our platform or in our platform’s market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face sub stantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 















many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our operations also include the sale of information and analytical tools under our bondticker tm and trax ® brands and posttrade services such as presettlement trade matching and regulatory reporting for the european markets there is a high degree of competition in data pricing and transaction reporting products and services and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge our information products and posttrade and services lines may be threatened by new regulations market trends or technologies that reduce their value if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our revenues could be adversely impacted and as a result our businesses financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform we cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 524 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate

historically our business operations have been substantially located in the us and the uk while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries such as 

brexit moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are una ble to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

the uk electorate voted in favor of a uk exit from the eu in a referendum which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition

the uk has voted in an advisory referendum to leave the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the referendum was nonbinding however as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk withdrawal from the eu under the process for withdrawing from the eu contemplated in the treaty on european union the uk will remain a member state until a withdrawal agreement is entered into or if later and no extension is agreed two years following notification of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the eu the effects of brexit on us will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets – including for financial services – either during a transitional period or more permanently although the uk government has not yet delivered an official notice of withdrawal brexit is expected to significantly affect the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in the uk and could have a material impact on its economy and the future growth of its various industries including the financial services industry in which we operate 

we conduct business in europe primarily through our uk subsidiaries depending on the terms of brexit we could face new regulatory costs and challenges for instance our uk subsidiaries may not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market if this occurred we may need to establish one or more new regulated subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu 

although we have an international customer base we could be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the pound sterling and the uk economy changes to uk immigration policy could likewise occur as a result of brexit in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate any such new laws and regulations in the uk may be difficult andor costly to implement 

although it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of an exit of the uk from the eu any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition brexit may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

























if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of futur e commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition under certain of our fee plans our fees are designated in basis points in yield and as a result are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity we anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

we are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary  

in connection with our anonymous open trading ™ protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing open trading ™ trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability these risks include among others potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade the settlement of the trade or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client in addition because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platform clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately a large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our electronic platform although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our open trading™ participants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

in the us the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in addition there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years moreover several of our large brokerdealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome in recent years further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 142 153 and 140 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively based on information filed with the sec by this institutional investor client as of december 31 2016 investment funds managed by this institutional investor client beneficially owned approximately 76 of the outstanding shares of our common stock primarily through passive index and etf funds 

the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 



























as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients however we cannot assure you that these new features and versions will become or remain successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets such as our recent entry into the municipal bond market however we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities including among other things our entrance into the municipal bond market will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or 

adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing ma rket conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our bond reference databases and the clearing and settlement of our open trading ™ transactions disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

















in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 















any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

in these circumstances if we were unable to execute our disaster recovery plans or our redundant systems and disaster recovery plans proved insufficient for the particular situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

it is also a risk that we will not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all such system problems our disaster recovery plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation 

we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform our business could suffer a material adverse effect 

our electronic trading platform involves the processing storage and transmission of a very large number of transactions and data including confidential client information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations cyber attacks on our systems could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information leading to litigation reputational harm and possible liability despite the defensive measures we have taken these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsource or infrastructure

support providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to wh om we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential inf ormation our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techni ques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the third party service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents and network or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyber attack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure

there have been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various industries including ours any such cyber incident involving our computer systems and networks or those of third parties important to our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a thirdparty service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences including but not limited to 







our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any stolen financial assets or misappropriated confidential information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the 

manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 















we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

















these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significan t acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock includ ing options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

our investments in expanding our information and posttrade services businesses may not produce substantial revenue or profit

with respect to our information and posttrade services businesses we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service even after incurring these costs we ultimately may not sell any or sell only small amounts of these products or services consequently if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion and development initiatives the upfront costs associated with them may exceed the related revenue and reduce our working capital and income

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of credit products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the united kingdom the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada and the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm with the fca and has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated including 













we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

certain of our regulated subsidiaries including our registered brokerdealer and mtf are subject to us or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our authority to operate our platform in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis if at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1 business—government regulation” 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business 

the financial services industry in general is heavily regulated proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the united states congress in state legislatures and by foreign governments the government agencies that regulate us continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives may adopt new or revised laws and regulations and have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules regulations and industry standards of practice in light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry we are unable to predict which of these proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and that of our clients are also affected by the policies adopted by the federal reserve and international central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our customers or increase the cost for our customers to trade the instruments on our platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for capital raising and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

in addition regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were approved in june 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while some of the technical advice underpinning mifid ii have not yet been finalized mifid ii will have a significant impact in these areas as well as on corporate governance and investor protection mifid ii and mifir are expected to take effect in january 2018 and may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations but they may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development and growth of impacted markets to become impractical for example the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which adversely affects our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform other regulatory initiatives include basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and liquidity in most of the world’s major economies by 2019 the implementation of these rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and brokerdealer customers to raise additional capital and liquidity as a result their businesses could be adversely affected which might cause them to trade less on our platform in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material currently our central limit order book trading service for singlename credit derivatives and our midx matching service for corporate bonds are regulated as alternative trading systems subject to regulation ats 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe latin america and asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

















our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of the fca in the uk and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example regulatory bodies in europe have approved the final texts of mifid ii and mifir which are expected to take effect in january 2018 we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure 

we cannot predict what future actions the us uk and other regulatory bodies might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which e  u  laws to replace or replicate our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

extensive regulation of our businesses results in ongoing exposure to potential significant costs and penalties 

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly this trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future and this environment may create uncertainty accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

to manage the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our riskmanagement methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our riskmanagement methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our riskmanagement policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24houraday global nature of our business 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed poli cies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in addition we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or se rvice and the period before the product or service is successfully developed introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years even after incurring these costs our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions

over the past few years there have been several highprofile cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees of financial services firms our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades resolution of trade error claims system failures mismanagement or even fraud we may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

















the growth of our open trading ™ protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 1000 million subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 





















we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to com ply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid inter est under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit ext ensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries including the us and the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars british pounds sterling and euros since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our net investment in our uk subsidiaries and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 













most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in 

v olatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely t he market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or if we continue paying dividends that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods if we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends investors may need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 







provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 















critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer clients 

in 2016 our business faced a challenging macro environment which we attribute to a number of cyclical factors including accommodative monetary policies by several major central banks including the federal reserve and the european central bank these monetary policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across most of the fixed income markets the global credit markets have also faced structural issues in recent years such as trading limits imposed by the volcker rule increased bank capital requirements under basel iii and the quantitative easing program of the european central bank following the us presidential election in november however the global credit markets experienced a significant shift in sentiment and increased volatility with the expectation of an upward trend in interest rates and inflation 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer or alltoall trading platforms competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe called for increased regulation and transparency in the overthecounter markets as a result the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivative instruments “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary operates as a sef for the trading of certain index swaps the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules following the us presidential and congressional elections in november 2016 president trump has stated that he will pursue a path of financial deregulation including by signing an executive order that requires the treasury department to review the provisions of the doddfrank act 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading 

platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were approved in june 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to approved reporting mechanisms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while some of the technical advice underpinning mifid ii have not yet been finalized mifid ii will have a significant impact in these areas as well as on corporate governance and investor protection mifid ii and mifir are expected to take effect in january 2018 the final rules may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to cause us to expend significantly more compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

in june 2016 the uk voted in an advisory referendum to leave the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the followup to the referendum is not yet clear as the uk government has not yet delivered an official notice of withdrawal however depending on the terms negotiated between eu member states and the uk following brexit our uk subsidiaries may not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single eu market and we may need to establish one or more new regulated subsidiaries in the eu in order to provide our trading platform and certain posttrade services to clients in the eu 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between and among our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and distributi on fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending o n the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform 

other credit commissions other credit includes eurobonds emerging markets bonds highyield bonds and municipal bonds commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules during the fourth quarter of 2016 our eurobond fee plan structure was changed to contain standardized minimum monthly commitments and variable transaction fees prior to the fee plan change our european fee plans generally incorporated some combination of monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees the average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols 

liquid products commissions liquid products includes us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from information and posttrade services investment income and other income 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include revenue from professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of acc ounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform information and posttrade services products and other services 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information and posttrade services 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment clearing costs from matched principal trades board of directors’ expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

expenses may grow in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion we also expect occupancy expense to increase in each of 2017 and 2018 as a result of the additional amount of office space needed to accommodate our headcount including our new global headquarters in new york city see item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our properties however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software including among other items employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two matched principal trades fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients  institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from regul atory transaction reporting and trade matching services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we generate revenues from professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” revenue from professional consulting services is recognized as services are performed and software license subscription revenue and maintenance and support services are recognized ratably over the contract period technology products and services revenue is reported in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of a dealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years initial setup fees are reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives

we operate as a single reporting unit subsequent to an acquisition goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit as a result all of our fair value is available to support the value of goodwill an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

segment results 

we operate an electronic multiparty platform for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for certain geographic information about the company’s business required by us gaap

our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows 

 



 

for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 265 increase in our us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated market share of adjusted total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” from 146  for the year ended december 31 2015 to 160 for the year ended december 31 2016 coupled with an increase in overall market volume as measured by trace we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 adjusted us highgrade trace volume increased 154 to 46 trillion for the year ended december 31 

2016 from 40 trillion for the year ended december 31 2015 based on information provided b y finra we believe that the trace volumes as adjusted by us provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting we have provided a reconciliation of the reported us highgrade trace volumes to the adjusted us highgrade trace volumes in th e “investor relations” section of our website

total us highgrade average variable transaction fee per million increased to 185 per million for the year ended december 31 2016 from 175 per million for the year ended december 31 2015 mainly due to an increase in the duration of bonds traded other credit average variable transaction fee per million decreased to 256 per million for the year ended december 31 2016 from 290 per million from december 31 2015 the decrease was due to a larger percentage of volume in products that carry lower fees per million principally eurobond and emerging market sovereign bonds and highyield protocols that carry lower fees per million

 

distribution fees

us highgrade distribution fees increased 06 million principally due to an increase in unused monthly fee commitments under our all variable fee plan the 11 million decrease in other credit distribution fees principally relates to the change in eurobond fee plans implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 the new eurobond bond fee plans contain standardized minimum monthly commitments and variable transaction fees

information and posttrade services the 06 million increase in information and posttrade services revenue comprised of a 29 million increase in data revenue due to new contracts and a 06 million increase in transaction reporting revenue offset by a 29 million unfavorable impact of the strengthened us dollar our transaction reporting business processed 121 billion transactions for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 105 billion for the year ended december 31 2015

the 152 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was attributable to an increase in net purchases of securities availableforsale of 243 million an increase in capital expenditures of 31 million offset by proceeds from sales and maturities and other investing activities of 122 million 

the 48 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 90 million offset by excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 51 million 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

the 102 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income of 212 million an increase in stock compensation expense of 28 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of 12 million offset by an increase in working capital of 132 million and an increase in deferred taxes of 21 million 

the 249 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in net purchases in securities availableforsale of 231 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 06 million 

the 92 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a reduction of 148 million in repurchases of our common stock offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 56 million 

nongaap financial measures

in addition to cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap we use a nongaap financial measure called “free cash flow” free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities excluding net purchases of corporate debt trading investments less expenditures for furniture equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs we believe this nongaap financial measure is important in gaining an understanding of our financial strength and cash flow generation

the table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow as defined for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015

 





other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the uk or ontario securities commission in canada and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2016 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2016 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 1260 million in excess of the required levels of 106 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

as of december 31 2016 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 628 million we have determined that unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us any repatriation of such foreign earnings by way of dividend may be subject to both us federal and state income taxes reduced by applicable foreign tax credits however we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries 

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 revenues from matched principal trading were approximately 377 million 169 million and 74 million respectively under securities clearing agreements with third party clearing brokers we maintain collateral deposits with each clearing broker in the form of cash as of december 31 2016 the amount of the collateral deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was 11 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 clearing expenses associated with matched principal transactions were 61 million 33 million and 13 million respectively and are classified under general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements between us and our clearing brokers each clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty credit failure on any of our trades we did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to this right for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy

effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2016 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows resulting from the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 672 million and the fair value of the liability was 03 million 

 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016 we had 1931 million of investments in corporate bonds that were classified as securities availableforsale or trading securities adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our business – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2016 our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to 3626 million a hypothetical five basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease our annual pretax earnings by approximately 02 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2016 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the availableforsale investment portfolio by approximately 08 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 08 million would be recognized in other comprehensive income on the statement of financial condition 

a similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately 09 million the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 09 million would be recognized in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 

we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

foreign currency exchange rate risk

we conduct operations in several different countries outside of the us most notably the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in non us dollar currencies since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

during the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 13 of our revenue and 27 of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar most notably the british pound sterling based on actual results over the past year a hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in the us dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately 47 million and operating expenses by approximately 49 million

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus british pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 672 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

credit risk 

two of our subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited act as a matched principal counterparty in connection with the open trading ™ transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our open trading ™ clients executing bond trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at this bank

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixedincome market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments using our patented trading technology our over 1000 active participant firms include brokerdealer clients investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds our approximately 100 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading through our open trading tm initiative we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions we also provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services to the securities markets in addition we provide technology solutions and professional consulting services to fixedincome industry participants 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds our trading platform provides access to global liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european bonds us agency bonds credit derivatives and other fixedincome securities 

our open trading tm protocols allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment these innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery and then trade those securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from all of our participating brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional 

investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

according to the federal reserve outstanding us highgrade corporate bond debt has increased approximately 52 from yearend 2008 to september 30 2015 the most recent date available during this same period financial market regulators have increased capital requirements for bankowned brokerdealers holding corporate bond inventory as a result corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined partly as a result of these trends overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover we have responded with a series of new open trading tm protocols designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2015 we completed approximately 180000 trades utilizing our open trading™ solutions an increase of 134 compared to 2014

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however in connection with our open trading™ or other anonymous protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 79 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2015 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

in 2015 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 168 of the total estimated adjusted us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 and the inclusion of 144a securities in reported trace volumes beginning on july 1 2014 trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” we provide both the reported and adjusted us highgrade trace volumes on our website we believe that the adjusted estimated volumes provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting

through our trax ® brand we provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services for european securities and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products trax provides the company with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming preand posttrade transparency mandates from the markets in financial instruments directive “mifid” ii in europe 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2015 the most recent date available there were approximately 396 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 82 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds as measured by trace was 240 billion in 2015 primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 87 billion as of december 31 2015 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k 

the us highgrade corporate bond market represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market finra includes over 46000 unique securities in the list of traceeligible bonds representing the majority of the daily trading volume of highgrade bonds according to the federal reserve us highgrade corporate bond debt outstanding has increased approximately 260 from 65 trillion at yearend 2010 to 82 trillion at september 30 2015 over the last four years highgrade corporate bond issuance was over 10 trillion each year exceeding prefinancial crisis levels notwithstanding the growth in the total amount of debt outstanding turnover which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding for the bonds that traded is below creditcrisis lows the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace increased to approximately 40 trillion for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 37 trillion and 36 trillion for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we believe that the low level of turnover is an indicator of liquidity challenges in the credit markets

prior to regulatory reforms such as basel iii and regulations under the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” dealer balance sheets were relatively elastic so dealers were able to facilitate trading in most fixedincome products without dramatic price moves the regulatory reforms enacted after the global financial crisis resulted in greater capital and liquidity requirements for dealers which impacted market liquidity and diminished risk appetite by market intermediaries the volcker rule which limits proprietary trading by banks has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as effective marketmakers as a result we believe market participants require new solutions to increase liquidity and we have responded with our open trading™ protocols designed to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment

emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2015 the most recent date available was 67 billion of external markets debt and 110 billion of local markets debt 

crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investmentgrade by one agency but investmentgrade by the other  the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma decreased by 163 to 2605 billion in 2015 from 3114 billion in 2014 primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2015 was approximately 81 billion

european highgrade corporate bond market 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 











we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market 

us agency bond market 

we define the us agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 20 trillion as of september 30 2015 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of us agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace declined from approximately 102 billion at december 31 2011 to 50 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 

credit derivative market 

credit derivatives are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions we operate a swap execution facility pursuant to the us commodity futures trading commission’s “cftc” rules and we list certain credit derivatives for trading by us persons and other participants on our sef the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs that would govern the execution of singlename credit derivatives nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules according to the depository trust  clearing corporation trade information warehouse the average daily trading volume of credit derivatives for the year ended december 31 2015 was approximately 860 billion

trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services 

in europe the first mifid set bestexecution requirements for trades and mandated that financial firms submit to their local regulators detailed endofday reports including the time and price of a trade the counterparty involved and whether it was a purchase or sale firms must either become socalled approved reporting mechanisms “arms” or use one of the approved providers  such as our trax ® arm to submit such reports  in the uk required transactions are reported to the financial conduct authority “fca” mifid ii will increase the number of fields that must be reported to regulators and we expect the demand for experienced regulatory trade reporting service providers to increase over the next several years 

trade matching enables counterparties to agree the terms of a trade shortly after execution reducing the risk of errors and a trade failing during settlement in 2014 the central securities depositories regulation shortened the securities settlement cycle for all cash securities including corporate bonds across the european union “eu” to no later than two days after the date on which a trade is executed referred to as a t2 settlement cycle we believe that the move to t2 settlement increased the need for trade matching services such as those provided by our trax ® brand in europe 

our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 







we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of over 1000 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients 

our total bond trading volume increased from 5216 billion in 2011 to 9785 billion in 2015 as indicated below

our adjusted estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume for 2015 was approximately 168 and 93 respectively our estimated market share from 2011 to 2015 is shown in the chart below 

 

 

adjusted by us to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliated backtoback trades to finra by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 and the inclusion of 144a securities in reported trace volumes beginning on july 1 2014

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is approximately 9 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 80000 we believe our open trading tm protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our open trading tm participants to interact in an alltoall trading environment thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our bondticker tm service eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

transparent pricing on a range of securities institutional investors and brokerdealer clients can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of market participants who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to other participants who may respond with executable prices within the time period specified by the requestor through our open trading™ protocols  participants may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely 

and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing th at is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to increase the amount of crossregional activity by our institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform subject to regulatory requirements 

leverage our existing client network and technology to increase counterparties and improve liquidity 

due to regulatory changes that have caused significant reductions in primary dealer corporate bond balance sheets our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients need new and innovative electronic trading solutions to promote secondary market liquidity we intend to continue to develop and deploy a wide range of electronic trading protocols to complement our traditional requestforquote model these open trading™ protocols increase potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2015 we completed approximately 180000 trades using our open trading™ solutions

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently 

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings 

we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we expect to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we also plan to expand and enhance the trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services provided by trax ® in europe to enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to mifid ii

and includes aggregated volume and pricing for the most actively traded european fixed income instruments  we intend to con tinue to widen the user base of our data products and to continue adding new content and analytical capabilities as the use of our electronic trading platform continues to grow we believe that the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will als o increase further enhancing the value of our information services offerings to our clients 

pursue select acquisitions and strategic alliances 

we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients

straightthrough processing and apis 

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations 

usage of our straightthrough processing tools increased significantly during the last several years the number of investor client stp connections increased to 518 as of december 31 2015 in addition many of our brokerdealer clients use our application programming interfaces “api” services for pretrade trade negotiation and posttrade services to improve efficiency and reduce errors in processing 

sales and marketing 

we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force is responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our trading platform and information and posttrade services by our existing clients their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use our system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixedincome trading platform we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing promotional mailings and participation in industry conferences and media engagement to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform for example we have worked with the wall street journal to establish bondticker tm as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and highyield tables a similar process also exists for our trax ® posttrade business employing both direct and indirect sales methods 

competition 

the industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 









competitors including companies in which some of our clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore some of our clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore a significant number of our institutional investor firms have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor firms on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading 

plat form website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ®  trax ®  trade on ®  liquiditybridge ®  axess 50 ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks bondticker tm  open trading tm  axess all tm  and marketaxess bidask spread index basi tm are trademarks we use but they have not been registered 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and an alternative trading system operator it is also a member of finra a selfregulatory organization to which most brokerdealers belong in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary operates as a sef for the trading of certain credit derivatives subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction including certain index swaps subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination that are required to be executed on a sef or regulated exchange the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the recently adopted volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the eu and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation our principal regulator in the uk is the fca marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility “mtf” with the fca and is also a registered platform in switzerland hong kong and singapore xtrakter is registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fca and also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

the securities industry in the member states of the eu is regulated by agen cies in each member state eu measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the eu  as an fca approved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” were approved in june 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while some of the rules and technical advice underpinning mifid ii have not yet been finalized mifid ii will have a significant impact in these areas as well as on corporate governance and investor protection mifid ii and mifir are expected to take effect in january 2018 the final rules may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to cause us to expend more significant compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations will be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined 

our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada company is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada our brazilian subsidiary marketaxess platforma de negociacao ltda is authorized to provide our platform in brazil under the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

























any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically our market share of the fixedincome trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt the level of bond fund inflows or outflows the percentage of volumes comprised of rule 144a transactions the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as ‘block trades’ and whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment

a decline in trading volumes on our platform or our platform’s market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face substantial compe tition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 















many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 53 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate

historically our business operations have been substantially located in the us and the uk while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

























if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded we anticipate that average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary  

in connection with our anonymous open trading ™ protocols we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing open trading ™ trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients can arise whereby one of the counterparties to the transaction rejects the trade or otherwise refuses to settle their side of the transaction on the terms recorded by our platform these unsettled or rejected trades can create a potential liability for our subsidiary involved in the trade if an error is promptly discovered and alleged by a client and there is a prompt cancellation of the trade or disposition of any resultant position held by us or the other party to the trade  the risk to us is usually limited if the discovery of an error by a client is delayed the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening movements in the price of the applicable security prior to disposition although errors usually become known at the time of or later on the day of the trade it is possible that they may not be discovered until later in the settlement process if we are required to hold a position as a result of an error or a failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us  depending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute  such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and many of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

in the us the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities if bankaffiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted which could adversely affect our operating results in addition there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years moreover several of our large brokerdealer clients have announced plans to reduce their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 153 140 and 125 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as of december 31 2015 investment funds managed by this institutional investor client beneficially owned approximately 89 of the outstanding shares of our common stock primarily through passive index and etf funds 

the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional inve stor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our busi ness financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 



























as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients however we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities including among other things our proposed entrance into the municipal bond market will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on thirdparty vendors for our corporate bond reference database and the clearing and settlement of our open trading ™ transactions disruptions in the services provided by those thirdparties to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide services that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our thirdparty service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

















in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 















any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

in these circumstances if we were unable to execute our disaster recovery plans or our redundant systems and disaster recovery plans proved insufficient for the particular situation it could have a material adverse effect on our business similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be 

adequate or implemented properly in addition our busi ness interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

it is also a risk that we will not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all such system problems our disaster recovery plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation 

we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform our business could suffer a material adverse effect 

our electronic trading platform involves the processing storage and transmission of a very large number of transactions and data including confidential client information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations cyber attacks on our systems could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information leading to litigation reputational harm and possible liability despite the defensive measures we have taken these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsource or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

we also face the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints of any of the third party service providers that facilitate our business activities including clients clearing agents or data providers such parties could also be the source of a cyber attack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure

there have been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various industries including ours any such cyber incident involving our computer systems and networks or those of third parties important to our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a thirdparty service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences including but not limited to 







our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and 

collab orators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents wil l protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our perm ission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently develop ing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 















we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks including 

















these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

our investments in expanding our information and posttrade services businesses may not produce substantial revenue or profit

with respect to our information and posttrade services businesses we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service even after incurring these costs we ultimately may not sell any or sell only small amounts of these products or services consequently if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion and development initiatives the upfront costs associated with them may exceed the related revenue and reduce our working capital and income

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of credit products many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff additionally highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may also discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company or that is required to retain existing employees we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the united kingdom the monetary authority of singapore the hong kong securities and futures commission the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil and the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm with the fca and has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 













we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a mtf respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our authority to operate as a broker dealer in a jurisdiction is dependent on cont inued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval aud it and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all app licable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems  procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain an d improve these systems 

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis if at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1—business—government regulation” 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business

the financial services industry in general is heavily regulated proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the united states congress in state legislatures and by foreign governments the government agencies that regulate us continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives may adopt new or revised laws and regulations and have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules regulations and industry standards of practice in light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry we are unable to predict which of these proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and that of our clients are also affected by the policies adopted by the federal reserve and international central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our customers or increase the cost for our customers to trade the instruments on our platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for capital raising and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our c ontrol and are difficult to predict 

in addition following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe have called for increased regulation and transparency in the otc markets as a result the doddfrank act was signed into law in 2010 among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or sefs in each case subject to certain key exceptions marketaxess sef corporation is registered with the cftc as a sef for certain credit derivatives no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace including the sec’s rules that will govern the execution of singlename credit derivatives will be finalized or implemented or whether we will be able to operate a sef or securitybased sef that can successfully compete for the credit derivative execution business of our clients in addition we have incurred significant costs to comply with the new regulatory requirements of the doddfrank act and we cannot assure you that the additional costs associated with the registration and operation of a sef or securitybased sef will not exceed our expected revenues or that our financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were approved in june 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while some of the rules and technical advice underpinning mifid ii have not yet been finalized mifid ii will have a significant impact in these areas as well as on corporate governance and investor protection mifid ii and mifir are expected to take effect in january 2018 the final rules may have an adverse effect on our 

operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully co mpete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to cause us to expend more significant compliance business and technology resources incur additional oper ational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses  we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations but they ma y have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development and growth of impacted markets to become impractical for example the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform other regulatory initiatives include basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and liquidity in most of the world’s major economies by 2019 the implementation of these rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and brokerdealer customers to raise additional capital and liquidity as a result their businesses could be adversely affected which might cause them to trade less on our platform in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material currently our central limit order book trading service for singlename credit derivatives and our midx matching service for corporate bonds are regulated as alternative trading systems subject to regulation ats 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and may further expand our operations throughout europe asia and other regions we have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services however there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

















our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of the fca in the uk and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business for example regulatory bodies in europe have approved the final texts of mifid ii and mifir which are expected to take effect in january 2018 we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may cause us to 

expend more significant compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure 

we cannot predict what future actions the us uk and other regulatory bodies might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

extensive regulation of our businesses results in ongoing exposure to potential significant costs and penalties 

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly this trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future and this environment may create uncertainty accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

to manage the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our riskmanagement methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our riskmanagement methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our riskmanagement policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24houraday global nature of our business 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitor ing or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in addition we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service and the period before the product or service is successfully 

developed introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years even after incurring these costs our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions

over the past few years there have been several highprofile cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees of financial services firms our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

















the growth of our open trading ™ protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 1000 million subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 





















we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted ebitda level we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading a variety of fixedincome securities including for larger size trades we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries including the us and the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling and euros since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adver se movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 













most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or if we continue paying dividends that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods if we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 







provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 















critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer clients 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe have called for increased regulation and transparency in the overthecounter markets as a result the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivative instruments “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary operates as a sef for the trading of certain credit derivatives subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction including certain index swaps subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination that are required to be executed on a sef or regulated exchange the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example while the recently adopted volcker rule does not apply directly to us the volcker rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets mifid ii and mifir were approved in june 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to approved reporting mechanisms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while some of the rules and technical advice 

underpinning mifid ii have not yet been finalized mifid ii will have a significant impact in these areas as well as on corporate governance and investor protection m ifid ii and mifir are expected to take effect in january 2018  the final rules may have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to cause us to expend more significant compliance business and technology resources incur additional operational costs and create additional re gulatory exposure for our trading and posttrade businesses while we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in way s yet to be determined 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under these fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform 

other credit commissions other credit includes emerging markets bonds highyield bonds eurobonds and structured products bonds commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plans generally incorporate monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees 

liquid products commissions liquid products includes us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterpart y to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from information and posttrade services technology products and services income on investments and other income 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we generate revenue from professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information and posttrade services products 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax

critical accounting policies and estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software including among other items employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two matched principal trades fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting and trade matching services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we generate revenues from professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable 

we enter into time and materials professional consulting contracts unrelated to any software product revenue for time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed we generally sell software license subscriptions on a standalone basis or software licenses and pcs together as part of multipleelement arrangements revenue for software license subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract period for arrangements that include multiple elements generally software licenses and pcs we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the 

performance period for pcs the term is typically one year and revenue is recognized over the duration of the arrangement on a straightline basis 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of a brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years initial setup fees are reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangible assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives

we operate as a single reporting unit subsequent to an acquisition goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit as a result all of our fair value is available to support the value of goodwill an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

segment results 

we operate an electronic multiparty platform for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services we consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for certain geographic information about the company’s business required by us gaap

total revenues increased by 403 million or 153 to 3031 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from 2628 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in commission revenue of 451 million partially offset by a decrease in technology products and services revenue of 33 million a 72 change in the foreign currency exchange rates of the pound sterling compared to the us dollar from the year ended december 31 2014 to the year ended december 31 2015 had the effect of decreasing revenues by 30 million

our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows 

 



 

for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 215 increase in our us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated adjusted market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” from 145  for the year ended december 31 2014 to 168 for the year ended december 31 2015 we adjusted the reported us highgrade trace volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades by certain brokerdealers that occurred from april 2014 through october 2015 and the inclusion of 144a securities in reported trace volumes beginning on july 1 2014 adjusted finra trace us highgrade volume increased 48 to 34 trillion for the year ended december 31 2015 from 33 trillion for the year ended december 31 2014 based on information provided by finra we 

believe that the trace volumes  as adjusted by us  provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting we have provided a reconciliation of the reported us highgrade trace volumes to the adjusted us highgrade trace volumes in the “investor relations” section of our website  

other credit volumes increased by 484 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 primarily due to increases of 78 in eurobond volume 62 in highyield bond volume and 30 in emerging markets bond volume

distribution fees

us highgrade distribution fees increased 14 million principally due to the migration over the past year of certain of our brokerdealer clients from an allvariable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee the 17 million decrease in other credit distribution fees principally relates to the migration of certain eurobond dealers to plans that incorporate a higher level of variable fees and lower level of monthly distribution fees 

information and posttrade services information and posttrade services revenues decreased by 09 million the change in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing information and posttrade services revenue by approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2015 excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange information services revenue increased 22 million principally as a result of new data contracts posttrade services revenues excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange decreased by 12 million due to a reduction in transactions xtrakter’s posttrade transaction reporting business processed approximately 1050 million and 1100 million transactions for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

technology products and services technology products and services revenues decreased by 33 million principally due to the winddown of a professional consulting service engagement

liquidity and capital resources 

during the past three years we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand and internally generated funds cash and cash equivalents and securities availableforsale totaled 2844 million at december 31 2015 

in january 2013 we entered into a threeyear credit agreement that provided for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 500 million in october 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” increasing the borrowing capacity to an aggregate of 100 million including a 50 million sublimit for standby letters of credit the credit agreement will mature in october 2017 as of december 31 2015 we had 11 million in letters of credit outstanding leaving 989 million available to borrow under the credit agreement subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement by an additional 500 million 

our cash flows were as follows 

 



cash flows for the year ended december 31 201 5 compared to year ended december 31 201 4 

the 102 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income of 212 million an increase in stock compensation expense of 28 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of 12 million offset by an increase in working capital of 132 million and an increase in deferred taxes of 21 million 

the 249 million increase in net cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in net purchases in securities availableforsale of 231 million and an increase in capital expenditures of 06 million 

the 92 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a reduction of 148 million in repurchases of our common stock offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock of 56 million 

cash flows for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to year ended december 31 2013 

the 191 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net income from continuing operations of 62 million an increase in depreciation and amortization of 43 million a decrease in working capital of 44 million and a decrease in deferred taxes of 10 million 

the 561 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due to the acquisition of xtrakter in 2013 for 378 million an increase in net proceeds from securities availableforsale of 185 million and a decrease in capital expenditures of 85 million offset by a decrease of 93 million in cash proceeds from the sale of greenline in 2013

past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity business and financial condition 

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the uk or ontario securities commission in canada and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2015 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2015 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 1160 million in excess of the required levels of 94 million 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

as of december 31 2015 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 419 million we have determined that unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us any repatriation of such foreign earnings by way of dividend may be subject to both us federal and state income taxes reduced by 

applicable foreign tax credits however we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries 

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 revenues from matched principal trading were approximately 169 million 74 million and 60 million respectively under securities clearing agreements with a third party clearing broker we maintain collateral deposits with the clearing broker in the form of cash as of december 31 2015 the amount of the collateral deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was 15 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 clearing expenses associated with matched principal transactions were 33 million 13 million and 09 million respectively and are classified under general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements between us and our clearing brokers the clearing brokers have the right to charge us for losses resulting from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through such clearing broker at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had not recorded any liabilities with regard to this right 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

see item 5 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy

effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2015 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows resulting from the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 454 million and the fair value of the asset was 04 million 

 




 i tem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015 we had an 847 million investment in securities availableforsale which were primarily invested in corporate bonds and municipal bonds adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our business – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2015 our cash and cash equivalents amounted to 1997 million a hypothetical five basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would decrease our annual pretax earnings by approximately 01 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 31 2015 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the availableforsale portfolio by approximately 09 million assuming no change in the amount or composition of the investments the hypothetical unrealized gain loss of 09 million would be recognized in other comprehensive income on the statement of financial condition we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was 454 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

credit risk 

two of our subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited act as a matched principal counterparty in connection with the open trading ™ transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our open trading ™ clients executing bond trades on our platform including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients can arise whereby one of the counterparties to the transaction rejects the trade or otherwise refuses to settle their side of the transaction on the terms recorded by our platform although we maintain a clearly erroneous trade policy for open trading ™ transactions in order to promote the integrity of the platform and to maintain safeguards these unsettled or rejected trades can still create a potential liability for our subsidiary involved in the trade if an error is promptly discovered and alleged by a client and there is a prompt cancellation of the trade or disposition of any resultant position held by us or the other party to the trade the risk to us is usually limited if the discovery 

of an error by a client is delayed the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening movements in the price of the applicable security prior to disposition although errors usually become known at the time of or later on the day of the trade it is possible that they may not be discovered until later in the settlement process if we are required to hold a pos ition as a result of an error or a failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charg es required to be taken by us d epending on the cause number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at this bank

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixedincome market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments using our patented trading technology our over 1000 active participant firms include brokerdealer clients investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds our approximately 90 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal often called “riskless principal” basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions we also provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services to the securities markets in addition we provide technology solutions and professional consulting services to fixedincome industry participants 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds our trading platform provides access to global liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european bonds us agency bonds credit derivatives and other fixedincome securities 

through our open trading tm initiative we have designed a series of protocols to allow our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment these innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and 

 

offers simultaneously from all of our participating brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

according to the federal reserve outstanding us highgrade corporate bond debt has increased approximately 43 from yearend 2008 to september 30 2014 the most recent date available during this same period financial market regulators have increased capital requirements for bankowned brokerdealers holding corporate bond inventory as a result corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined partly as a result of these trends overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover we have responded with a series of new marketaxess open trading tm protocols designed to allow our brokerdealers and institutional investor clients to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2014 we completed approximately 77000 trades utilizing new electronic open trading™ solutions

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however in connection with our open trading™ or other anonymous protocols we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 96 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 76 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2014 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

in 2014 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 145 of the total estimated us highgrade corporate bond volume as adjusted by us to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades beginning in april 2014 and the inclusion of 144a securities beginning on july 1 2014 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter “otc” secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us including trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers as well as interdealer and retail trading all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” we provide both the reported and adjusted us highgrade trace volumes on our website we believe that the adjusted estimated volumes provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting

in february 2013 we acquired xtrakter limited “xtrakter” from euroclear sanv through our trax ® brand xtrakter is a ukbased provider of trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services for european securities and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products the acquisition of xtrakter provided the company with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming preand posttrade transparency mandates from the markets in financial instruments directive ii “mifid ii” in europe 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2014 the most recent date available there were approximately 384 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 77 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds excluding 144a securities as measured by trace was 177 billion in 2014 

 

primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 149 billion as of december 31 2014 this represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by trace the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace increased to approximately 33 trillion for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 32 and 30 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change which has been driven by a number of factors including 











emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2014 the most recent date available was 94 billion of external markets debt and 133 billion of local markets debt 

 

crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investmentgrade by one agency but investmentgrade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma declined by 68 to 430 billion during 2008 from 1360 billion in 2007 primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt beginning in 2009 however the highyield corporate bond markets demonstrated significant improvement and new issuance for the year ended december 31 2014 had increased to 3110 billion as reported by sifma 

finra publicly disseminates realtime price information on approximately 7000 highyield corporate bond issues and disseminates price information about certain other transactions on a delayed basis trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and the bond trades an average of once or more a day the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2014 was approximately 46 billion 

european highgrade corporate bond market 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 









we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market 

us agency bond market 

we define the us agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 20 trillion as of september 30 2014 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of us agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2014 was approximately 59 billion 

credit derivative market 

credit derivatives are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations according to the depository trust  clearing corporation trade information warehouse the notional amount of credit default swaps outstanding was approximately 160 trillion as of december 31 2014 and the average daily trading volume for the year ended december 31 2014 was approximately 1300 billion in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions since october 2013 we have operated a temporarily registered sef pursuant to the us commodity futures trading commission’s “cftc” rules and we list credit derivative indices and options for trading by us persons and other participants on our sef in february 2014 us counterparties became required to execute those swaps that are subject to the cftc’s madeavailablefortrade determinations on a sef or designated contract market the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs that would govern our execution of singlename credit derivatives nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and 

 

implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere have developed new rules for derivatives trading for example in july 2014 the paneuropean mifid ii was entered into force with rules requiring the central clearing of standardized otc derivatives the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories and the trading of standardized derivatives only on a regulated trading venue such as our multilateral trading facility “mtf”  although the final rules for mifid ii have not yet been finalized and their ultimate impact on the european derivatives market is not yet known mifid ii is expected to be implemented in the beginning of 2017

trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services 

trade matching is an operational risk management tool that enables counterparties to agree the terms of a trade shortly after execution reducing the risk of errors and a trade failing during settlement in 2014 the central securities depositories regulation shortened the securities settlement cycle for corporate bonds across the european union “eu” to no later than two days after the date on which a trade is executed referred to as a t2 settlement cycle we believe that the move to t2 settlement will increase the need for trade matching services such as those provided by our trax ® brand 

adopted in late 2007 the first markets in financial instruments directive set bestexecution requirements for trades and mandated that financial firms submit to their local regulators detailed endofday reports including the time and price of a trade the counterparty involved and whether it was a purchase or sale firms must either become socalled approved reporting mechanisms “arms” or use one of the approved providers  such as our trax ® arm  in most cases both the fund manager and its executing brokerdealer or bank must include the same details of the same trade on their respective transaction reports in the uk required transactions are reported to the financial conduct authority “fca” mifid ii increased the number of fields that must be reported to regulators and we expect the demand for experienced regulatory trade reporting service providers to increase over the next several years 

our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 







we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of over 1000 active institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients 

 

our total bond trading volume increased from 4021 billion in 2010 to 7670 billion in 2014 as indicated below

our adjusted estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume for 2014 was approximately 145 and 62 respectively our estimated market share from 2010 to 2014 is shown in the chart below 

 

 

adjusted by us to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliated backtoback trades to finra beginning in april 2014 and the inclusion of 144a securities in reported trace volumes beginning on july 1 2014

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer 

 

corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is approximately 9 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 80000 

transparent pricing on a range of securities institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within the time period specified by the institutional investor through our open trading™ protocols  institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

other service offerings 

in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including 

information services the information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions our corporate bondticker tm provides access to realtime and historical price yield and marketaxess estimated spreadto

some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include 











 



independence 

we believe the current regulatory environment creates competitive advantages for independent companies like us that are less prone to conflicts of interest as an independent company we are free to make business and trading protocol decisions with the best interests of both our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients in mind we are also able to attract industry leaders with valuable skills and insights to our independent board of directors 

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to increase the amount of crossregional activity by our institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform subject to regulatory requirements 

leverage our existing client network and technology to increase counterparties and improve liquidity 

due to regulatory changes that have caused significant reductions in primary dealer corporate bond balance sheets our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients need new and innovative electronic trading solutions to promote secondary market liquidity we intend to continue to develop and deploy a wide range of electronic trading protocols to complement our traditional requestforquote model these open trading™ protocols increase potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to interact in an alltoall trading environment during 2014 we completed approximately 77000 trades using new electronic open trading™ solutions

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently as an example we developed technology and trading protocols to trade credit derivatives in anticipation of implementation of the doddfrank act since october 2013 we have operated a temporarily registered sef pursuant to cftc rules and we list credit derivative indices and options for trading by us persons and other participants on our sef 

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings 

we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we expect to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we also plan to expand our trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services provided by trax ® in europe 

expand our data and information services offerings 

we regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondticker™ in order to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients we plan to expand the data service offering provided by trax ® in europe with additional content related to trading volume and pricing for example we recently launched axess 50™ a data tool which provides insights into intraday activity for a significant subset of the most liquid credit bonds trading in europe we intend to continue to widen the user base of our data products and to continue adding new content and analytical capabilities as the use of our electronic trading platform continues to grow we believe that the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will also increase further enhancing the value of our information services offerings to our clients 

 

pursue select acquisitions and strategic alliances 

we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients 

the acquisition of xtrakter in february 2013 provided us with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming preand posttrade transparency mandates from mifid ii in europe in april 2013 we entered into a strategic alliance with blackrock inc “blackrock” to create a unified open trading solution designed to help reduce liquidity fragmentation and improve pricing across the us cash credit markets in january 2015 we expanded our strategic alliance with blackrock to include the european cash credit markets

straightthrough processing and apis

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations 

usage of our straightthrough processing tools increased significantly during the last several years the number of investor client stp connections increased to 425 as of december 31 2014 from 244 as of december 31 2010 in addition many of our brokerdealer clients use our api services for pretrade trade negotiation and posttrade services to improve efficiency and reduce errors in processing 

sales and marketing 

we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force is responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our trading platform and information and posttrade services by our existing clients their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use our system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixedincome trading platform we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing promotional mailings and participation in industry conferences and media engagement to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform for example we have worked with the wall street journal to establish corporate bondticker tm as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and highyield tables a similar process also exists for our trax ® posttrade business employing both direct and indirect sales methods 

 

competition 

the industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face five main areas of competition 











competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

















we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore 425 of our institutional investor firms have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor firms on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ®  trax ®  trade on ®  liquiditybridge ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks corporate bondticker tm  marketaxess open trading tm and axess 50 tm are trademarks we use but they have not been registered 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer and an alternative trading system operator it is also a member of finra a selfregulatory organization to which most brokerdealers belong in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or sefs in each case subject to certain key exceptions in september 2013 the cftc granted temporary registration to marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary to operate a sef for the trading of swaps subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction the cftc’s rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented in october 2013 and in february 2014 certain credit derivatives became subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination and were thereafter required to be executed on a sef or designated contract market the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example the volcker rule promulgated under the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the eu and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation our principal regulator in the uk is the fca marketaxess europe limited is registered as a mtf with the fca and xtrakter limited is registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fca xtrakter also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

the securities industry in the member states of the eu is regulated by agencies in each member state eu measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the eu as an fca approved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets including changes to market structure transparency requirements for fixedincome instruments derivatives trading and posttrade reporting obligations in june 2014 the final texts of mifid ii and markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” were published in the official journal of the european union a large amount of implementation work is left to be completed and the rules of mifid ii and mifir will not take effect for 30 months after publication or until january 2017 mifid ii introduces changes in market structure designed to i enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to approved reporting mechanisms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data we cannot predict the extent to which any of these future regulatory changes may adversely affect our european business and operations 

our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada company is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 























any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 















many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into or otherwise compete in market segments in which we provide services potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

our growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 53 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability in recent years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate

historically our business operations have been substantially located in the us and the uk while we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas we are still highly concentrated in these areas accordingly our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries moreover due to the concentration of our operations in these areas such operations are less diversified and accordingly are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors if we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

























if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded we anticipate that average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary  

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us in connection with open 

 

trading™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients can arise whereby one of the counterparties to the transaction rejects the trade or otherwise refuses to settle their side of the transaction on the terms recorded by our platform these unsettled or rejected trades are referred to as “out trades” and they create a potential liability for our subsidiary involved in the trade if an error is promptly discovered and alleged by a client and there is a prompt cancellation of the trade or disposition of the unmatched position by us or the other party to the trade the risk to us is usually limited if the discovery of an error by a client is delayed the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening movements in the price of the applicable security prior to disposition although out trades usually become known at the time of or later on the day of the trade it is possible that they may not be discovered until later in the settlement process although our error policies and procedures are intended to limit our liability in the event of an out trade the occurrence of out trades generally rises with increases in the volatility of the market and depending on their cause number and amount such out trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we are also developing additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

in addition there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years moreover some of our large brokerdealer clients have announced plans to reduce their sales and trading businesses in fixedincome further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition which may lower volumes 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 140 125 and 135 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as of december 31 2014 investment funds managed by this institutional investor client beneficially owned approximately 9 of the outstanding shares of our common stock primarily through passive index and etf funds 

the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 



























as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients however we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities including among other things our proposed operation of a sef and a securitybased sef under the doddfrank act will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 









developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that thirdparty to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

















in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 















any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

 

in these circumstances our redundant systems and disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

it is also a risk that we will not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all such system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform our business could suffer a material adverse effect 

our electronic trading platform involves the processing storage and transmission of a very large number of transactions and data including confidential client information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations cyber attacks on our systems or the systems of our thirdparty service providers could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information leading to litigation and possible liability despite the defensive measures we have taken these threats may come from external factors such as governments organized crime hackers and other third parties such as outsource or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business would suffer and we could incur material liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 

there have been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various industries including ours any such cyber incident involving our computer systems and networks or those of third parties important to our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a thirdparty service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences including but not limited to 







our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 13 patents and have filed other patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we 

 

cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 















we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic for example we acquired xtrakter in february 2013 we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments including the xtrakter acquisition may involve a number of risks including 









 









these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

our investments in expanding our information and posttrade services businesses may not produce substantial revenue or profit

with respect to our information and posttrade services businesses we may incur substantial development sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service even after incurring these costs we ultimately may not sell any or sell only small amounts of these products or services consequently if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion and development initiatives the upfront costs associated with them may exceed the related revenue and reduce our working capital and income

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel 

 

competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive as the financial industry continues to recover from and evolve following the financial crisis and as electronic commerce continues to experience strong growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations these regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders the sec finra the cftc and other agencies extensively regulate the united states financial services industry including most of our operations in the united states much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions including regulations overseen by the fca in the united kingdom the monetary authority of singapore the investment industry regulatory organization of canada and provincial regulators in canada the securities and exchange commission and central bank in brazil and the swiss financial market supervisory authority in switzerland in addition xtrakter is registered as an arm with the fca and has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators

as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 













we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a mtf respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator marketaxess sef corporation has received temporary registration from the cftc to operate a sef and is required among other things to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year 

our authority to operate as a brokerdealer in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance credit approval audit and reporting systems and procedures as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance credit approval audit and risk management personnel our systems and procedures 

 

may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations in addition the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems procedures and personnel and has resulted and we expect will continue to result in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems

in addition because our industry is heavily regulated regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis if at all even if approvals are obtained they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations the implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical for a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities see “item 1—business—government regulation” 

some of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership these regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary which may include changes in control of marketaxess as a result of these regulations our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body

our business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business

the financial services industry in general is heavily regulated proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the united states congress in state legislatures and by foreign governments the government agencies that regulate us continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives may adopt new or revised laws and regulations and have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules regulations and industry standards of practice in light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry we are unable to predict which of these proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and that of our clients are also affected by the policies adopted by the federal reserve and international central banking authorities which may affect the credit quality of our customers or increase the cost for our customers to trade the instruments on our platform in addition such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for capital raising and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 

in addition following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe have called for increased regulation and transparency in the otc markets as a result the doddfrank act was signed into law in 2010 among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or sefs in each case subject to certain key exceptions marketaxess sef corporation has received temporary registration from the cftc to operate a sef for credit derivative indices and options and we currently anticipate that we will register with the sec and operate a securitybased sef when the sec finalizes the rules that will govern the execution of singlename credit derivatives no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented or whether we will be able to operate a sef or securitybased sef that can successfully compete for the credit derivative execution business of our clients in addition we have incurred significant costs to comply with the new regulatory requirements of the doddfrank act and we cannot assure you that the additional costs associated with the registration and operation of a sef and securitybased sef will not exceed our expected revenues or that our financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets in june 2014 the final texts of mifid ii and mifir were published in the official journal of the european union a large amount of implementation work is left to be completed and the rules of mifid ii and mifir will not take effect for 30 months after publication or until january 2017 mifid ii introduces changes in market structure designed i to enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to arms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data while the broad framework of mifid ii is known we believe that it is too early for there to be clarity on the specific aspects of the proposals which may directly impact our businesses such as the new transparency regime for fixedincome instruments as some rules and technical advice have not yet been finalized the final rules may have an adverse 

 

effect on our operations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and nonregulated venues for the fixedincome trading needs of our clients in addition mifid ii is expected to increase the regulatory obligations and costs of our posttrade reporting and matching businesses we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations but they may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development and growth of impacted markets to become impractical for example the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform other regulatory initiatives include basel iii a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and liquidity in most of the world’s major economies by 2019 the implementation of these rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and brokerdealer customers to raise additional capital and liquidity as a result their businesses could be adversely affected which might cause them to trade less on our platform in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material currently our central limit order book trading service for singlename credit derivatives and our midx matching service for corporate bonds are regulated as alternative trading systems subject to regulation ats 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and may further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

















our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of the fca in the uk and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe have approved the final texts of mifid ii and mifir which will enter into effect in january 2017 we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our european business and operations but they may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we cannot predict what future actions the us uk and other regulatory bodies might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

extensive regulation of our businesses results in ongoing exposure to potential significant costs and penalties 

our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators including us and nonus government agencies and selfregulatory organizations as well as state securities commissions in the us are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations inspections and investigations which may result in costs penalties fines enhanced oversight additional requirements restrictions or limitations and censure suspension or expulsion selfregulatory organizations such as finra and the national futures association “nfa” along with statutory bodies such as the sec the cftc finra and the fca and other international regulators require strict compliance with their rules and regulations

firms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years and penalties fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities including the sec the cftc finra the nfa state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the us and the fca in the uk and other international regulators have increased accordingly this trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future and this environment may create uncertainty accordingly we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

to manage the risks inherent in our business we must maintain effective policies procedures and systems that enable us to identify monitor and control our exposure to financial legal regulatory operational and market risks our riskmanagement methods are based on internally developed controls observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices our riskmanagement methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design their implementation or the lack of adequate accurate or timely information our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses if our riskmanagement policies and efforts are ineffective we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets personnel clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us that information may not in all cases be accurate complete uptodate or properly analyzed furthermore we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24houraday global nature of our business 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory operational and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in particular we may not be successful in implementing all of the necessary processes to support and manage the xtrakter acquisition for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition of xtrakter see the risk factor captioned “if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions” 

 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm over the past few years there have been several highprofile cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees of financial services firms our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

















the growth of our open trading ™ protocols in particular is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business in addition our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties other third parties or us

all or part of any debt financing would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 500 million subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the credit agreement by an additional 500 million our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 





















we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products and trade sizes historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities including for larger size trades we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries including the us and the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling and euros since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 













most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future if we were to cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 







provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and the consolidation or contraction of our brokerdealer clients 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry governments and regulators in both the united states and europe have called for increased regulation and transparency in the overthecounter markets as a result the doddfrank act was signed into law in july 2010 among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of many credit derivative instruments through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those instruments through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions in september 2013 the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” granted temporary registration to marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary to operate a sef for the trading of swaps subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction the cftc’s rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented in october 2013 and in february 2014 certain credit derivatives became subject to the cftc’s ‘made available for trade’ determination and were thereafter required to be executed on a sef or designated contract market the securities and exchange commission “sec” has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented 

various rules promulgated since the financial crisis could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform for example the volcker rule promulgated under the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates in addition enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the us and europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for the fixedincome markets in june 2014 the final texts of mifid ii and markets in financial instruments regulation “mifir” were published in the official journal of the european 

 

union a large amount of implementation work is left to be completed and the rules of mifid ii and mifir will not take effect for 30 months after publication or until january 2017 mifid ii introduces changes in market structure designed i to enhance pre and posttrade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity ii increase and enhance posttrade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit posttrade data to approved reporting mechanisms iii ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and iv establish a consolidated tape for trade data we cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our european business and operations

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 











we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under the fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield yearstomaturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform 

other credit commissions other credit includes emerging markets bonds highyield bonds eurobonds and structured products bonds commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plans generally incorporate monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees 

liquid products commissions liquid products includes us agency european government bonds and credit derivatives commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules 

 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from information and posttrade services technology products and services income on investments and other income 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we generate revenue from professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information and posttrade services products 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment clearing costs from matched principal trades board of directors’ expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

 

expenses may grow in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits and depreciation and amortization primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software including among other items employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two matched principal trades fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are deferred and recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we generate revenues from professional consulting services technology software licenses and maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable 

we enter into time and materials professional consulting contracts unrelated to any software product revenue for time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed we generally sell software license subscriptions on a standalone basis or software licenses and pcs together as part of multipleelement arrangements revenue for software license subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract period for arrangements that include multiple elements generally software licenses and pcs we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the 

 

undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period for pcs the term is typically one year and revenue is recognized over the duration of the arrangement on a straightline basis 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years initial setup fees are reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives

we operate as a single reporting unit subsequent to an acquisition goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit as a result all of our fair value is available to support the value of goodwill an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment

total expenses increased by 128 million or 97 to 1442 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 1315 million for the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits of 106 million depreciation and amortization of 33 million technology and communication costs of 16 million and marketing and advertising costs of 11 million which were partially offset by a decrease in professional and consulting fees of 38 million the increase in expenses reflects the inclusion in 2014 of two additional months of expenses from xtrakter during the second quarter of 2013 we determined that we had incorrectly excluded incentive compensation as a component of employee compensation eligible for capitalization under our software development costs capitalization policy we recorded this item as an outofperiod adjustment in the three months ended june 30 2013 by reducing employee compensation and benefits expense by 29 million and increasing depreciation and amortization expense by 13 million the change in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing expenses by 17 million for the year ended december 31 2014

our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows 

 



 

for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 80 increase in us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in our estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” from 138 for the year ended december 31 2013 to 145 adjusted by us to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate backtoback trades to finra beginning in april 2014 and the inclusion of 144a securities in reported trace volumes beginning on july 1 2014 for the year ended december 31 2014 coupled with an increase in estimated us highgrade trace volume estimated us highgrade trace volume for the year ended december 31 2014 was 34 trillion an increase of approximately 5 from the year ended december 31 2013 based on information provided by finra we believe that the trace volumes as adjusted by us provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting we have provided a reconciliation of the 

 

reported us highgrade trace volumes to the adjusted us highgrade trace volumes in the “investor relations” section of our website

other credit volumes increased by 275 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to increase in estimated market share in emerging markets bonds eurobonds and highyield bonds liquid products volume decreased by 141 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 due mainly to lower trading volumes in us agency bonds estimated us agency trace volumes declined by 176 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013

distribution fees increased by 35 million or 58 to 649 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from 614 million for the year ended december 31 2013 us highgrade distribution fees increased 45 million principally due to the migration over the past year of certain of our brokerdealer clients from an allvariable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a monthly distribution fee the 14 million decrease in other credit distribution fees principally relates to the migration of certain eurobond dealers to plans that incorporate a higher level of variable fees and lower level of monthly distribution fees the 05 million increase in liquid products distribution fees was due to the commencement of sefrelated revenues during 2014

net cash used in investing activities was 691 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 150 million for the year ended december 31 2012 in february 2013 we acquired xtrakter for 378 million in cash net of cash acquired we received cash proceeds on the october 2013 sale of greenline of 93 million net of cash sold and transaction expenses net purchases of securities availableforsale were 173 million and net proceeds of securities availableforsale were 254 million for year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively capital expenditures were 233 million and 104 million for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the higher capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2013 were primarily due to higher capitalized software expenditures associated with new product initiatives the buildout of a replacement primary production data center in 2013 and the buildout costs for new office space in london in 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 171 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 1362 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the 1190 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to repurchases of our common stock in 2012 of 751 million lower excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation of 97 million and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 55 million offset by a decrease in cash dividends paid on common stock of 442 million and lower withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of 150 million w e paid a special cash dividend on our common stock in december 2012 of 476 million 

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

certain of our us subsidiaries are registered as a brokerdealer or a sef and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec and the cftc these rules contain minimum net capital requirements as defined in the applicable regulations and also may require a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the financial conduct authority in the uk or ontario securities commission in canada and must maintain financial resources as defined in the applicable regulations in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement as of december 31 2014 each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements as of december 31 2014 our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were 811 million in excess of the required levels of 124 million 

 

each of our us and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

as of december 31 2014 the amount of unrestricted cash held by our nonus subsidiaries was 298 million we have determined that unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us any repatriation of such foreign earnings by way of dividend may be subject to both us federal and state income taxes reduced by applicable foreign tax credits however we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries 

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 revenues from matched principal trading were approximately 74 million 60 million and 35 million respectively under securities clearing agreements with a third party clearing broker we maintain a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash as of december 31 2014 the amount of the collateral deposit included in prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition was 09 million we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements between us and our clearing brokers the clearing brokers have the right to charge us for losses resulting from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through such clearing broker at december 31 2014 and 2013 we had not recorded any liabilities with regard to this right 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of material loss to be remote 

in january 2014 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 350 million of our common stock in july 2014 our board of directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional 650 million of our common stock for the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased 646185 shares of our common stock at a cost of 380 million as of december 31 2014 approximately 620 million remains authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program shares repurchased under the program will be held in treasury for future use the share repurchase program will expire on december 31 2015

in january 2015 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 020 per share payable on february 26 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 12 2015 any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors our board of directors may take into account such matters as general business conditions our financial results capital requirements contractual obligations legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to their respective parent entities and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant

effects of inflation 

because the majority of our assets are shortterm in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

as of december 31 2014 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 



 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows resulting from the net investment in our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2014 the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was 320 million and the fair value of the asset was 01 million 

in january 2013 we entered into a threeyear credit agreement that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 500 million subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the credit facility by an additional 500 million 

in january 2015 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend to be paid to the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock a cash dividend of 020 per share will be payable on february 26 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 12 2015 we expect the total amount payable to be approximately 75 million 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2014 we had a 649 million investment in securities availableforsale adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our business – global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ” 

interest rate risk 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to the money market instruments and fixedincome securities in which we invest as of december 31 2014 our cash and cash equivalents and securities availableforsale amounted to 2338 million and were primarily invested in money market instruments corporate bonds and municipal securities we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

derivative risk 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2014 the notional fair value of our foreign currency forward contract was 320 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

credit risk 

our subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited act as a matched principal counterparty in certain transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing broker settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us in connection with open trading ™ or other anonymous protocols we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase 

in the process of executing matched principal transactions miscommunications and other errors by our clients can arise whereby one of the counterparties to the transaction rejects the trade or otherwise refuses to settle their side of the transaction on the terms recorded by our platform these unsettled or rejected trades are referred to as “out trades” and they create a potential liability for our subsidiary involved in the trade if an error is promptly discovered and alleged by a client and there is a prompt cancellation of the trade or disposition of the unmatched position by us or the other party to the trade the risk to us is usually limited if the discovery of an error by a client is delayed the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening movements in the price of the applicable security prior to disposition although out trades usually become known at the time of or later on the day of the trade it is possible that they may not be discovered until later in the settlement process although our error policies and procedures are intended to limit our liability in the event of an out trade the occurrence of out trades generally rises with increases in the volatility of the 

 

market and depending on their cause number and amount such out trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk in connection with the recent growth of our open trading ™ protocols we are also developing additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure there can be no assurance that the policies procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete uptodate or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at this bank

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixedincome market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments using our patented trading technology our over 1000 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade in us or european fixedincome securities through our electronic trading platform during 2013 include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios brokerdealers and hedge funds our 90 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which then settle through a thirdparty clearing organization we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions we also provide trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services to the securities markets in addition we provide technology solutions and professional consulting services to fixedincome industry participants 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds our trading platform provides access to global liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european bonds us agency bonds credit default swaps “cds” and other fixedincome securities 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 67 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we estimate that outstanding us highgrade corporate bond debt has increased approximately 60 from yearend 2008 to yearend 2013 during this same period financial market regulators have increased capital requirements for bankowned brokerdealers holding corporate bond inventory as a result corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined partly as a result of these trends overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover we have responded with a series of new marketaxess open trading tm protocols designed to allow our brokerdealers and institutional investor clients to operate in an alltoall trading environment these innovative technology solutions are designed to increase potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics during 2013 we completed approximately 14000 trades utilizing new electronic open trading solutions including market lists

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization 

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 70 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2013 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 138 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2013 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers trace facilitates the mandatory reporting of overthecounter secondary market transactions in eligible fixedincome securities in the us all brokerdealers that are finra member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to trace under a set of rules approved by the securities and exchange commission “sec” 

in february 2013 we acquired xtrakter limited “xtrakter” from euroclear sanv xtrakter is a ukbased provider of trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services for european securities and market and reference data across a range of fixedincome products the acquisition of xtrakter provides the company with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming preand posttrade transparency mandates from the markets in financial instruments directive ii in europe the aggregate purchase price was 378 million in cash net of acquired cash

 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2013 the most recent date available there were approximately 395 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 96 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as measured by trace was 170 billion in 2013 

primary dealer holdings of us corporate bonds investmentgrade and highyield as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york were 210 billion as of december 31 2013 this represents less than two days of trading volume as measured by trace the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace increased to approximately 32 trillion for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 29 trillion for each of the prior four calendar years the european credit markets saw moderate improvement in 2013 as credit spreads tightened throughout the year 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

 emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets external and local markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2013 the most recent date available was 69 billion and 128 billion respectively 

 

crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investmentgrade by one agency but investmentgrade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma declined by 68 to 430 billion during 2008 from 1360 billion in 2007 primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the highyield corporate bond markets demonstrated significant improvement beginning in 2009 with new issuance for the year ended december 31 2013 increasing to 3365 billion as reported by sifma 

finra publicly disseminates realtime price information on approximately 5000 highyield corporate bond issues and disseminates price information about certain other transactions on a delayed basis trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and the bond trades an average of once or more a day the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2013 was approximately 42 billion 

european highgrade corporate bond market 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market 

us agency bond market 

we define the us agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 21 trillion as of september 30 2013 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of us agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2013 was approximately 72 billion 

credit default swap market 

cds are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations according to the depository trust  clearing corporation trade information warehouse the notional amount of cds outstanding was approximately 202 trillion as of december 31 2013 and the average daily trading volume for the year ended december 31 2013 was approximately 1282 billion in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions the us commodity futures trading commission’s “cftc” rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented on october 2 2013 effective february 26 2014 counterparties must execute swaps that are subject to the made available for trade determinations on a sef or designated contract market the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented

 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement in 2012 that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized derivative contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services 

trade matching is an operational risk management tool that enables counterparties to agree the terms of a trade shortly after execution reducing the risk of errors and a trade failing during settlement 

adopted in late 2007 the paneuropean markets in financial instruments directive ii “mifid ii” which sets bestexecution requirements for trades mandates that financial firms submit to their local regulators detailed endofday reports including the time and price of a trade the counterparty involved and whether it was a purchase or sale firms must either become socalled accredited regulatory mechanisms “arms” or use one of the accredited providers in most cases both the fund manager and its executing brokerdealer or bank must include the same details of the same trade on their respective transaction reports in the uk required transactions are reported to the financial conduct authority “fca” formerly the financial services authority 

our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

  

 we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 90 brokerdealer marketmaking clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and over 1000 active institutional investor firms we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets and highyield bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients 

 

our total bond trading volume increased from 2983 billion in 2009 to 6937 billion in 2013 as indicated below 

 

our estimated share of us highgrade and highyield corporate bond volume for 2013 was approximately 138 and 52 respectively the increases were due in part to improved us credit market conditions increased client order flow and higher order execution rates our estimated market share from 2009 to 2013 is shown in the chart below 

 

 

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 80000 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 60 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within the time period specified by the institutional investor institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure

our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to increase the amount of crossregional activity by our institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform subject to regulatory requirements 

leverage our existing client network and technology to increase counterparties and improve liquidity 

due to regulatory changes our brokerdealers and institutional investors need new and innovative electronic trading solutions to promote secondary market liquidity we intend to continue to develop and deploy a wide range of electronic trading protocols to complement our traditional requestforquote model these protocols increase potential trading counterparties by allowing brokerdealers and institutional investors to operate in an alltoall trading environment 

 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently as an example we developed technology and trading protocols to trade cds in anticipation of implementation of the doddfrank act in september 2013 the cftc granted temporary registration to marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary to operate a sef for the trading of swaps

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings

straightthrough processing 

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations

competition 

the industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face five main areas of competition 

 

  

  

  

  

 competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore 380 of our institutional investor firms have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor firms on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 12 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology and additional patents are pending 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks corporate bondticker tm and marketaxess open trading tm are trademarks we use but they have not been registered 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer it is also a member of finra a selfregulatory organization to which most brokerdealers belong in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or sefs in each case subject to certain key exceptions in september 2013 the cftc granted temporary registration to marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary to operate a sef for the trading of swaps subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction the cftc’s rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented on october 2 2013 effective february 26 2014 counterparties must execute swaps that are subject to the made available for trade determinations on a sef or designated contract market the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented

the volcker rule promulgated under the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates the volcker rule could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation marketaxess europe limited and xtrakter limited may fall within the scope of those regulations depending on the extent to which they are characterized as providing a regulated investment service 

our principal regulator in the uk is the fca our subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility “mtf” dealer with the fca xtrakter limited is registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fca xtrakter also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

the securities industry in the member states of the european union is regulated by agencies in each member state european union measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the european union as an fca approved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement in 2012 that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized derivative contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

 

our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada company is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities or other business operations in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 57 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability over the past five years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

from time to time we have and may introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond eurobond cds and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions in which we act as a riskless principal intermediary  

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a riskless principal will increase 

 

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies may not provide full protection from such risk 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors in addition there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 125 135 and 146 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as of december 31 2013 investment funds managed by this institutional investor client beneficially owned approximately 9 of the outstanding shares of our common stock primarily through passive index and etf funds 

the obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide for example we have responded to the reduction in fixedincome secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by among other things introducing a number of alltoall trading options for our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients however we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities including among other things our proposed operation of a sef and a securitybased sef under the doddfrank act will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

 developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that thirdparty to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

in these circumstances our redundant systems and disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform our business could suffer a material adverse effect 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations cyber attacks on our systems or the systems of our thirdparty service providers could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information leading to litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures any cybersecurity breach may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a thirdparty service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences including but not limited to 

 

  

  

 our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have been issued 12 patents and have filed other patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that the patents applied for will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic on february 28 2013 we acquired xtrakter we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments including the xtrakter acquisition may involve a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive as the financial industry continues to recover from the financial crisis and as electronic commerce continues to experience strong growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec finra the cftc and the fca as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

xtrakter is registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fca xtrakter also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators marketaxess sef corporation has received temporary registration from the cftc to operate a sef and we intend to register with the sec and operate a securitybased sef 

in addition as a result of the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry there is a greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to increase government oversight of the financial services industry for example in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or sefs in each case subject to certain key exceptions the cftc’s rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented on october 2 2013 effective february 26 2014 counterparties must execute swaps that are subject to the made available for trade determinations on a sef or designated contract market the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented 

 

we have incurred significant costs to prepare for compliance with the new regulatory requirements we developed new technology and trading protocols to trade cds in anticipation of the sec’s and cftc’s implementation of the doddfrank act however despite our efforts there is no assurance that we will qualify or maintain our qualifications as a registered sef or that our systems will be effective if we do not qualify as a sef we will no longer be able to support cds trades and our business financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer as a result if we qualify as a sef the registration and additional oversight that we will need to comply with the regulation will increase the costs of our operations and the costs of using our products for our clients furthermore we are unable to predict how the markets will respond to the new regulatory regime 

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical for example the volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates which could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our central limit order book trading service for singlename cds and our midx matching service for corporate bonds are regulated as alternative trading systems subject to regulation ats 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and may further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism 

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of the fca in the uk and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

we cannot predict what future actions the us uk and other regulatory bodies might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

in addition the regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate have broad powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or keep us from engaging in some of our operations we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in particular we may not be successful in implementing all of the necessary processes to support and manage the xtrakter acquisition for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition of xtrakter see the risk factor captioned “if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions” 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

 

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm over the past few years there have been several highprofile cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees of financial services firms our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we expect that debt financing if available at all would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpm which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  co that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 500 million subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the credit agreement by an additional 500 million in total our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries including the us and the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling and euros since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

 

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting 

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future if we were to cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 

 

  

  

 provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquiror to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we assess liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings if any utilizing the latest information available for matters where it is probable that we will incur a material loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated we would establish an accrual for the loss once established the accrual would be adjusted to reflect any relevant developments when a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable we would not establish an accrual 

on january 2 2013 a former employee filed a complaint against us with the us department of labor alleging retaliatory employment practices in violation of the whistleblower provisions of the sarbanesoxley act the relief sought includes among other things reinstatement back pay and compensatory and punitive damages we believe the complaint is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations we filed a response to the complaint on february 26 2013 given the inherent uncertainty of the potential outcome of such proceedings we cannot estimate the reasonably possible range of loss at this time based on the available information we believe that the low end of the reasonably possible range of loss is zero and accordingly no loss accrual has been provided in our accompanying financial statements

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and consolidation or contraction of brokerdealers 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the securities and exchange commission “sec” and is a member of financial industries regulatory authority “finra” our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the financial conduct authority “fca” in the uk marketaxess canada company a canadian subsidiary is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada relevant regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities “sefs” in each case subject to certain key exceptions in september 2013 the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” granted temporary registration to marketaxess sef corporation our whollyowned us subsidiary to operate a sef for the trading of swaps subject to the cftc’s jurisdiction the cftc’s rules relating to the trading of swaps on sefs were implemented on october 2 2013 effective february 26 2014 counterparties must execute swaps that are subject to the made available for trade determinations on a sef or designated contract market the sec has not yet finalized its rules for securitybased sefs nor has it published a timetable for the finalization and implementation of such rules no assurance can be given regarding when whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace will be finalized or implemented

 

the volcker rule promulgated under the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates the volcker rule could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement in 2012 that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized derivative contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have been issued 12 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology and additional patents are pending 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and monthly distribution fees we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans for fully electronic trades generally incorporate variable transaction fees and distribution fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under the fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield and yearstomaturity of bonds traded on our platform 

other credit commissions other credit includes emerging markets and highyield bonds and eurobonds commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plans generally incorporate monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees 

liquid products commissions liquid products includes us agency and european government bonds commissions for liquid products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two riskless principal trades 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from information and posttrade services technology products and services income on investments and other income 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we provide technology solutions and professional consulting services to fixedincome industry participants technology products and services include software licenses maintenance and support services and professional consulting services 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors’ expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

expenses may grow in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits and depreciation and amortization primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

all accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than one year and are derived from tradingrelated fees and commissions and revenues from products and services we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software including among other items employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and posttrade services technology products and services investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two riskless principal trades fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly 

information and posttrade services we generate revenue from information services provided to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers information services are invoiced monthly quarterly or annually when billed in advance revenues are recognized monthly on a straightline basis we also generate revenue from trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided 

technology products and services we generate revenues from technology software licenses maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” and professional consulting services revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we generally sell software licenses and pcs together as part of multipleelement arrangements we also enter into contracts for technology integration consulting services unrelated to any software product 

for arrangements that include multiple elements generally software licenses and pcs we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue our vsoe of each element is based on historical evidence of standalone sales of these elements to third parties or the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period for pcs the term is typically one year and revenue is recognized over the duration of the arrangement on a straightline basis 

professional consulting services are generally separately priced and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee generally revenue from timeandmaterials consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract there were no contract loss provisions recorded as of december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services within other assets billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years initial setup fees are reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives

we operate as a single reporting unit subsequent to an acquisition goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit as a result all of our fair value is available to support the value of goodwill an impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis at yearend or more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to 15 years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

segment results 

we operate an electronic multiparty platform for the trading of fixedincome securities and provide related data analytics compliance tools and posttrade services our operations constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services of the financial markets in which we compete and of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business 

 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2013 compared to year ended december 31 2012

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

market risk 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2013 we had a 677 million investment in securities availableforsale adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our industry— global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer ”

credit risk 

we act as a riskless principal through marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited in certain transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback bond trades which are then settled through an independent thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure 

cash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at one major global bank given this concentration we are exposed to certain credit risk

part iv 




 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that allows investment industry professionals to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments our approximately 1000 active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade in us or european fixedincome securities through our electronic trading platform during 2012 include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios brokerdealers and hedge funds our 87 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading through our corporate bondticker tm service we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions in addition we provide fix financial information exchange message management tools connectivity solutions and ancillary technology services that facilitate the electronic communication of order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds assetbacked and preferred securities and credit default swaps “cds” 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication costs professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and general and administrative expenses 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 58 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

  

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization 

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 95 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 72 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2012 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 124 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2012 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

on october 26 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of xtrakter limited “xtrakter” from euroclear sanv xtrakter is a ukbased provider of regulatory transaction reporting financial market data and trade matching services to the european securities markets the acquisition of xtrakter will provide us with an expanded set of technology solutions ahead of incoming regulatory mandates in europe 

the aggregate purchase price is £260 million approximately 405 million in cash plus transaction costs and is subject to a postclosing adjustment based on the net working capital of xtrakter on the closing date the purchase price will be funded from available cash on hand we received financial service authority “fsa” approval of the change in control on february 18 2013 and expect to complete the acquisition of xtrakter on or about february 28 2013 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2012 the most recent date available there were approximately 377 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 86 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investment grade and highyield as measured by trace was 163 billion in 2012 

the us and european credit markets experienced a period of significant turmoil beginning during the third quarter of 2007 especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes the us credit markets demonstrated significant improvement since 2008 in addition primary dealer holdings of corporate bonds due in more than one year as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york declined from approximately 218 billion as of december 31 2007 to 57 billion as of december 31 2012 the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by trace has remained approximately 29 trillion for each of the four calendar years in the period ended december 31 2012 after declining to 20 trillion for the year ended december 31 2008 after demonstrating improved conditions during 2009 the european credit markets have deteriorated due in part to continuing sovereign debt credit concerns 

  

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” we use the terms highgrade debt and investmentgrade debt interchangeably in this annual report on form 10k 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last decade which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

european highgrade corporate bond market 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

  

 emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential the average daily trading volume of emerging markets external and local markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2012 was 68 billion and 140 billion respectively 

crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma declined by 68 to 430 billion during 2008 from 1360 billion in 2007 primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the highyield corporate bond markets demonstrated significant improvement beginning in 2009 with new issuance for the year ended december 31 2012 increasing to 3287 billion as reported by sifma 

finra publicly disseminates realtime price information on over 5000 highyield corporate bond issues and disseminates price information about certain other transactions on a delayed basis trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and the bond trades an average of once or more a day 

  

the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2012 was approximately 43 billion 

agency bond market 

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 24 trillion as of december 31 2012 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by trace for the year ended december 31 2012 was approximately 108 billion 

credit default swap market 

credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations the trading volumes and notional amount outstanding in cds transactions grew rapidly between 2002 and 2007 following counterparty credit concerns beginning in 2007 trading activity in the cds market declined substantially and the industry focused on netting down counterparty positions the notional amount of cds outstanding declined to 269 trillion as of june 30 2012 from 622 trillion as of december 31 2007 to address the counterparty credit concerns structural changes began to occur in the cds market that included the creation of cds clearing houses in 2009 that serve as central counterparties for certain cds transactions in 2010 in response to the financial crisis the us congress passed the doddfrank act which is intended to bring comprehensive reform to the regulation of swaps including cds among the most significant provisions of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing through regulated central clearing organizations of all swaps that the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” or the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has determined should be cleared “clearable swaps” and mandatory trading of clearable swaps on a board of trade designated as a contract market or a securities exchange or through a “swap execution facility” or sef in each case subject to certain key exceptions while we expect that the cftc and sec will adopt rules that detail the new regulatory regime regarding the swaps market place in 2013 no assurance can be given regarding when or whether such rules will be finalized and implemented subject to such rulemaking we intend to establish register and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility we believe that the introduction of the clearing mandates is likely to result in more standardized contracts and greater price transparency in the cds markets 

although the european regulators have not yet introduced legislation concerning regulation of the european derivatives markets the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized derivative contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

assetbacked securities 

assetbacked securities are ownership interests in a pool of receivables sold by originators into a special purpose vehicle these securities are typically secured by pools of homogeneous assets with relatively predictable cash flows the assets are legally separated from the seller which limits the investor’s exposure to the credit quality of the seller in 2012 approximately 1800 billion in us consumerbased assetbacked securities defined as including auto credit cards equipment and student loans and nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities were issued new issuance declined from over 10 trillion in 2007 as the assetbacked securities market was significantly impacted by the credit and housing market crisis the total amount of consumerbased assetbacked and nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities outstanding at december 31 2012 was 25 trillion as reported by sifma 

preferred securities 

preferred securities are equity ownership securities that carry additional rights above and beyond those conferred by common shares the additional rights typically include preference in dividends and seniority in assets visàvis common stock in the event of liquidation other typical features include convertibility into common stock callable at the option of the corporation and no voting rights 

  

our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

  

 we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 87 brokerdealer marketmaking clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and approximately 1000 active institutional investor firms we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that our net addition of 38 new brokerdealer marketmaking clients since the third quarter of 2008 has improved and will continue to improve the liquidity on our electronic trading platform for institutional investors further motivating them to use our platform the number of our active institutional investor clients for the past five years has been as follows 

 

  

our total trading volume increased from 2264 billion in 2008 to 5896 billion in 2012 we believe that our trading volumes in 2008 and 2009 reflect the turmoil and resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets beginning in the third quarter of 2007 our total trading volume over the past five years is indicated below 

 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds was approximately 66 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2008 as reported by trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers following the credit market turmoil our estimated market share declined to approximately 62 for the full year 2009 our estimated share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume for 2012 was approximately 124 double the estimated market share in 2009 due in part to improved us credit market conditions increased client order flow and higher order execution rates our estimated market share from 2008 to 2012 is shown in the chart below 

 

  

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 80000 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 45 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within the time period specified by the institutional investor institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems 

  

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

other service offerings 

in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including 

information services the information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions our corporate bondticker tm provides access to realtime and historical price yield and marketaxess estimated spreadtotreasuries for publicly disseminated traceeligible bonds corporate bondticker tm combines publiclyavailable trace data with the prices for trades executed on our us highgrade electronic trading platform integrating the two data sources and providing realtime trace data with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available our electronic trading platform allows institutional investors to compile sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual informationgathering process or other electronic services 

we offer a comprehensive set of reports designed to review and monitor credit trading activity for institutional investor clients these reports utilize extensive trace information and are accessible by means of a flexible interface to run and save reports in a variety of formats for both compliance and management reporting for example the best execution report provides a view of the savings generated by trading on our electronic trading platform and offers a quantitative measure of the value of price discovery from multiple dealers the report allows clients to monitor performance against their own best execution policy our compliance product provides a printed history of each inquiry submitted through the marketaxess trading platform

 our strategy 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to increase the amount of crossregional activity by our institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform subject to regulatory requirements 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently as an example we have developed technology and trading protocols to trade cds in anticipation of implementation of the doddfrank act and subject to such rulemaking we currently expect to establish and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new client segments

straightthrough processing 

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations

competition 

the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face five main areas of competition 

 

  

  

  

  

 competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

  

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore 325 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we have been issued 11 patents including five patents issued in 2009 covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology and additional patents are pending 

  

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks corporate bondticker tm is a trademark we use but it has not been registered 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer it is also a member of finra a selfregulatory organization to which most brokerdealers belong in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law us financial regulators are in the midst of an intense period of rulemaking that is required to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act and market participants will need to make strategic decisions in an environment of regulatory uncertainty among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions as with other parts of the doddfrank act many of the details of the new regulatory regime relating to swaps are left to the regulators to determine through rulemaking while we expect that the cftc and sec will adopt rules that detail the new regulatory regime regarding the swaps market place in 2013 no assurance can be given regarding when or whether such rules will be finalized and implemented subject to such rulemaking we currently expect to establish and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation marketaxess europe limited may fall within the scope of those regulations depending on the extent to which it is characterized as providing a regulated investment service 

our principal regulator in the uk is the fsa our subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility “mtf” dealer with the fsa xtrakter limited is registered and upon consummation of the pending acquisition will continue to be registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fsa xtrakter also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

  

the securities industry in the member states of the european union is regulated by agencies in each member state european union measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the european union as an fsa approved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada limited is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had 240 employees 194 of whom were based in the us and 46 of whom were based outside of the us principally in the uk none of our employees is represented by a labor union we consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 60 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability over the past three years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

  

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

from time to time we have and may introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond eurobond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions executed between our clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back bond trades  

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary and marketaxess europe limited our uk subsidiary act as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure 

  

we have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed income markets our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources such information may not be accurate complete or properly assessed and interpreted by us if our risk management procedures fail our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore our insurance policies may not provide full protection from such risk 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors in addition there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years further consolidation instability and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 135 146 and 158 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively this institutional investor client also beneficially owns approximately 7 of the outstanding shares of our common stock the contractual obligations of our institutional investor clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

   

developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we or our third party service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

  

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform our business could suffer a material adverse effect 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations cyber attacks on our systems or the systems of our third party service providers could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information leading to litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures any cybersecurity breach may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a third party service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences including but not limited to 

 

  

  

 our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have received 11 patents and have filed patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that the patents applied for will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

  

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

we have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies products or technologies that we believe are strategic on october 26 2012 we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of xtrakter we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments including the pending xtrakter acquisition may involve a number of risks including 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

  

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive as the financial industry continues to recover from the financial crisis and as electronic commerce continues to experience strong growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and finra as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator xtrakter is registered and upon consummation of the pending acquisition will continue to be registered as an approved reporting mechanism with the fsa xtrakter also has “recognized status” in france the netherlands and belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators 

in addition as a result of the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry there is a greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to increase government oversight of the financial services industry for example during 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law the doddfrank act creates an entirely new structure for the trading of overthecounter derivatives a market in which we currently operate among other things the doddfrank act mandates that clearable swaps trade on a board of trade designated as a contract market or a securities exchange or through a “swap execution facility” or sef in each case subject to certain key exceptions while we expect that the cftc and sec will adopt rules that detail the new regulatory regime regarding the swaps market place in 2013 no assurance can be given regarding when or whether such rules will be finalized and implemented subject to such rulemaking we intend to establish register and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

we have incurred significant costs to prepare for compliance with the new regulatory requirements we developed new technology and trading protocols to trade cds in anticipation of the sec and cftc’s implementation of the doddfrank act however despite our efforts there is no assurance that we will qualify as a registered sef or that our compliance systems will be effective if we do not qualify as a sef we will no longer be able to support cds trades and our business financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer as a result if we qualify as a sef the registration and additional oversight that we will need to comply with the regulation will increase the costs of our operations and the costs of using our products for our clients furthermore we are unable to predict how the markets will respond to the new regulatory regime 

  

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations the proposed volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates the volcker rule could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism for example the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have a material adverse effect on our business increased government deficits and debt levels along with ratings downgrades sparked fears in the global financial markets of default by euro zone nations leading to increased yields on government bonds and resulting in a more difficult trading environment for european corporate bonds due in part to the crisis and competitive environment in europe trading volume in our eurobond product has significantly decreased we reduced the monthly distribution fees paid by our european brokerdealer market makers effective march 1 2012 in order to encourage eurobond trading which resulted in decreased monthly distribution fee revenues despite our efforts eurobond trading volumes continued to decline there is no assurance that eurobond trading volumes and revenues will not continue to decline despite this change and any other efforts we may undertake 

  

in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of the financial services authority in the uk and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

we cannot predict what future actions the us uk and other regulatory bodies might take or the impact that any such actions may have on our business our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platform 

further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if they fail 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

in addition the regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate have broad powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or keep us from engaging in some of our operations we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources 

we have expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years continued growth both domestic and international will require further investment in management and new personnel infrastructure and compliance systems the expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets in particular we may not be successful in implementing all of the necessary processes to support and manage the pending xtrakter acquisition for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our pending acquisition of xtrakter see the risk factor captioned “if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions” 

we may not be able to manage our growth efficiently which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations if we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

in the event of employee error or misconduct our business may be harmed 

employee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm over the past few years there have been several highprofile cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees of financial services firms our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed 

errors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses regulatory sanctions and reputational harm the precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases 

  

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we expect that debt financing if available at all would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with jpm which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business for a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement see the risk factor captioned “our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions” 

in the future we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions 

we are party to a credit agreement with jpmorgan that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of 500 million subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions we are permitted to upsize the credit agreement by an additional 500 million in total our credit agreement contains certain covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take certain actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests these covenants restrict or prohibit among other things our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future a breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if any such event of default occurs the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement the lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions we may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results 

we conduct operations in several different countries including the us and the uk and substantial portions of our revenues expenses assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars pounds sterling and euros since our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars we must translate revenues income and expenses as well as assets and liabilities into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period accordingly increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies 

although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to variability in foreign currency cash flows and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure these hedging arrangements may not be effective particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our nonus denominated assets and liabilities accordingly if there are adverse movements in exchange rates we may suffer significant losses which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

as a public company we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management’s attention from our business 

we are subject to the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” and the related sec rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial reporting 

  

while our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in sox failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of sox if we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of sox in an efficient manner we may be subject to regulatory action in addition in the event that we identify a material weakness there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner moreover if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting which may have a material adverse effect on us

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future if we were to cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

  

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 

 

  

  

 provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquiror to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we assess liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings if any utilizing the latest information available for matters where it is probable that we will incur a material loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated we would establish an accrual for the loss once established the accrual would be adjusted to reflect any relevant developments when a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable we would not establish an accrual 

on january 2 2013 a former employee filed a complaint against us with the us department of labor alleging retaliatory employment practices in violation of the whistleblower provisions of the sarbanesoxley act the relief sought includes among other things reinstatement back pay and compensatory and punitive damages 

we believe the complaint is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against the allegations given the preliminary stage and the inherent uncertainty of the potential outcome of such proceedings we cannot estimate the reasonably possible range of loss at this time based on the available information we believe that the low end of the reasonably possible range of loss is zero and accordingly no loss accrual has been provided in our accompanying financial statements

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of information trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

 

  

  

   

  

 critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and consolidation or contraction of brokerdealers 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the fsa in the uk marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada relevant regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

  

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law us financial regulators are in the midst of an intense period of rulemaking that is required to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act and market participants will need to make strategic decisions in an environment of regulatory uncertainty among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions as with other parts of the doddfrank act many of the details of the new regulatory regime relating to swaps are left to the regulators to determine through rulemaking while the us commodity futures trading commission and the sec have adopted a number of rules that implement certain aspects of the new regulatory regime regarding the swaps market place no assurance can be given regarding when or whether the remaining rules including among others the rules regarding swap execution facilities and securitybased swap execution facilities will be finalized or implemented subject to such rulemaking we currently expect to establish and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

the proposed volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates the volcker rule could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european parliament and the eu council of ministers endorsed an agreement that will among other things require central clearing of standardized otc derivatives and the reporting of all derivatives otc or otherwise to trade repositories however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we have received 11 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology and additional patents are pending 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

  

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans for fully electronic trades generally incorporate monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under the fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client the us highgrade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and as a result is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded the average us highgrade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield and yearstomaturity of bonds traded on our platform 

eurobond commissions similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plan incorporates monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees in june 2010 we launched a clicktotrade protocol in the european market clicktotrade is offered alongside our requestforquote product and consists of streamed indicative pricing in credit and rates products clients have the ability to request a trade at the displayed price with the indicated dealer in connection with the launch the eurobond fee plan was revised and a standard commission rate was established across most types of bonds prior to this change the variable transaction fee was dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue 

other commissions commissions for other bond assetbacked and preferred securities trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the instrument traded we generally operate using standard fee schedules that may include both transaction fees and monthly distribution fees that are charged to the participating dealers 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from technology products and services information services fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients income on investments and other income 

technology products and services technology products and services includes software licenses maintenance and support services and professional consulting services 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker tm to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

  

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors’ expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

expenses may grow in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

all accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than one year and are derived from tradingrelated fees and commissions and revenues from products and services we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn the commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades fee programs for certain products include distribution fees which are recognized monthly 

technology products and services we generate revenues from technology software licenses maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” and professional consulting services revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we generally sell software licenses and pcs together as part of multipleelement arrangements we also enter into contracts for technology integration consulting services unrelated to any software product 

for arrangements that include multiple elements generally software licenses and pcs we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue the vsoe of each element is based on historical evidence of standalone sales of these elements to third parties or the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period for pcs the term is typically one year and revenue is recognized over the duration of the arrangement on a straightline basis 

professional consulting services are generally separately priced and are typically not essential to the functionality of the software products revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee generally revenue from timeandmaterials consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services within other assets billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

  

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years 

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives 

we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

segment results 

as an electronic multidealer platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2012 compared to year ended december 31 2011 

overview 

total revenues increased by 171 million or 94 to 1982 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 1811 million for the year ended december 31 2011 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in commissions of 188 million 

total expenses increased by 92 million or 89 to 1115 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher professional and consulting fees of 29 million technology and communications expense of 19 million employee compensation and benefits expense of 16 million and amortization and depreciation expenses of 15 million 

  

income before taxes increased by 80 million or 101 to 867 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 787 million for the year ended december 31 2011 net income increased by 124 million or 259 to 601 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 477 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

revenues 

our revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and the resulting dollar and percentage changes were as follows 

 

 commissions our commission revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and the resulting dollar and percentage changes were as follows 

 

 due in part to the continuing sovereign debt concerns and the competitive environment in europe trading volume in our eurobond product significantly decreased over the past several years monthly distribution fees paid by most of our european brokerdealer market makers were reduced effective march 1 2012 but the dealer variable fee schedule remained unchanged several additional european brokerdealer marketmakers remain on the original fee plan and may move to the new fee plan in the future 

  

the following table shows the extent to which the increase in commissions for the year ended december 31 2012 was attributable to changes in transaction volumes variable transaction fees per million and distribution fees 

 

 our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows 

 

 for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 136 increase in us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in the company’s estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by trace from 111 for the year ended december 31 2011 to 124 for the year ended december 31 2012 estimated trace us highgrade volume for the year ended december 31 2012 was 30 trillion an increase of approximately 16 from the year ended december 31 2011 our eurobond volumes decreased by 65 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 due in part to unfavorable market conditions in the european region emerging markets highyield and other volume increased by 139 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to higher emerging markets and highyield bond volumes 

our average variable transaction fee per million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was as follows 

 

   

the us highgrade average variable transaction fee per million increased to 197 per million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 183 per million for the year ended december 31 2011 the change was primarily due to an increase in the duration of bonds traded eurobond average variable transaction fee per million decreased to 73 per million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 99 per million for the year ended december 31 2011 emerging markets highyield and other average variable transaction fee per million increased to 214 per million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 175 per million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to a larger percentage of volume in products that carry higher fees per million principally emerging markets and highyield bonds 

technology products and services technology products and services revenues decreased by 20 million or 137 to 124 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 143 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease was primarily a result of lower technology integration consulting services and lower software license sales primarily due to a shift to a rental software license model 

information and user access fees information and user access fees increased by 02 million or 33 to 74 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 72 million for the year ended december 31 2011

 item 1 business 

marketaxess holdings inc the “company” or “marketaxess” operates a leading electronic trading platform that allows investment industry professionals to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments our over 850 active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade in us or european fixedincome securities through our electronic trading platform during 2011 include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios brokerdealers and hedge funds our 87 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading through our corporate bondticker tm service we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions in addition we provide fix financial information exchange message management tools connectivity solutions and ancillary technology services that facilitate the electronic communication of order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds assetbacked and preferred securities and credit default swaps “cds” 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and general and administrative expenses 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of 

  

index to financial statements communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 62 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization these are primarily voiceassisted trades a service that we introduced as an adjunct to rfq trading during late 2008 in response to the adverse effect of the credit crisis on dealer liquidity in corporate bonds we act as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved 

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us corporate bonds and approximately 64 of the underwriting of newly issued european corporate bonds in 2011 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 111 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2011 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 201l the most recent date available there were 

  

index to financial statements approximately 364 trillion principal amount of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 77 trillion principal amount of us corporate bonds according to the securities industry and financial markets association “sifma” the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investment grade and highyield as measured by finra trace was 161 billion in 2011 

the us and european credit markets experienced a period of significant turmoil beginning during the third quarter of 2007 especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes the us credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 2010 and early 2011 beginning in the second half of 2011 however credit spreads again widened and credit spread volatility increased in addition primary dealer holdings of corporate bonds due in more than one year as reported by the federal reserve bank of new york declined from approximately 218 billion as of december 31 2007 to 48 billion as of december 31 2011 the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by finra trace has remained approximately 29 trillion for each of the years ended december 31 2009 2010 and 2011 after declining to 20 trillion for the year ended december 31 2008 after demonstrating improved conditions during 2009 european credit markets deteriorated throughout 2010 and 2011 due in part to continuing sovereign debt credit concerns 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last decade which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

european highgrade corporate bond market 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

  

  

  

 we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

   

  

index to financial statements  emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include argentina brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential demand for emerging markets bonds declined significantly in late 2008 as the turmoil in the credit markets and the worldwide recession impacted the emerging markets emerging markets bond prices as measured by the jpmorgan emerging markets sovereign external debt and corporate bond indices fell steeply in 2008 but demonstrated significant improvement beginning in 2009 the average daily trading volume of emerging markets external debt and local markets debt as reported by the emerging markets trade association for the quarter ended september 30 2011 was 66 billion and 209 billion respectively 

crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance as reported by sifma was 1360 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 but declined to 430 billion during 2008 primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the highyield corporate bond markets demonstrated significant improvement beginning in 2009 with new issuance for the year ended december 31 2011 increasing to 2216 billion as reported by sifma 

finra publicly disseminates realtime price information on over 5000 highyield corporate bond issues and certain other transactions on a delayed basis trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds as measured by finra trace for the year ended december 31 2011 was approximately 44 billion 

agency bond market 

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 23 trillion as of december 31 2011 as reported by sifma the average daily trading volume of agency bonds excluding mortgagebacked securities as measured by finra trace for the year ended december 31 2011 was approximately 102 billion 

  

index to financial statements credit default swap market 

credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations the trading volumes and notional amount outstanding in cds transactions grew rapidly between 2002 and 2007 following counterparty credit concerns beginning in 2007 trading activity in the cds market declined substantially and the industry focused on netting down counterparty positions the notional amount of cds outstanding declined to 324 trillion as of june 30 2011 from 622 trillion as of december 31 2007 to address the counterparty credit concerns structural changes began to occur in the cds market that included the creation of cds clearing houses in 2009 that serve as central counterparties for certain cds transactions in 2010 in response to the financial crisis the us congress passed the doddfrank act which is intended to bring comprehensive reform to the regulation of swaps including cds among the most significant provisions of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing through regulated central clearing organizations of all swaps that the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” or the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has determined should be cleared “clearable swaps” and mandatory trading of clearable swaps on a board of trade designated as a contract market or a securities exchange or through a “swap execution facility” or sef in each case subject to certain key exceptions although the doddfrank act contemplated adoption and implementation of the rules to regulate the swaps market place by july 2011 this deadline was missed and neither the cftc nor the sec has published a definitive schedule for rule finalization and implementation we currently expect to establish and operate a sef as soon as the process is established we believe that the introduction of the clearing mandates is likely to result in more standardized contracts and greater price transparency in the cds markets 

although the european regulators have not yet introduced legislation concerning regulation of the european derivatives markets the european commission has issued three consultation papers intended to help define certain terms in the new otc derivatives landscape our expectation is that the eu will in line with the us mandate central clearing of standardized cds contracts and increase transparency through enhanced trade reporting requirements however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

assetbacked securities 

assetbacked securities are ownership interests in a pool of receivables sold by originators into a special purpose vehicle these securities are typically secured by pools of homogeneous assets with relatively predictable cash flows the assets are legally separated from the seller which limits the investor’s exposure to the credit quality of the seller in 2011 approximately 1400 billion in us consumerbased assetbacked securities defined as including auto credit cards equipment and student loans and nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities were issued new issuance declined from over 10 trillion in 2007 as the assetbacked securities market was significantly impacted by the credit and housing market crisis the total amount of consumerbased assetbacked and nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities outstanding at december 31 2011 was 25 trillion as reported by sifma 

preferred securities 

preferred securities are equity ownership securities that carry additional rights above and beyond those conferred by common shares the additional rights typically include preference in dividends and seniority in assets visàvis common stock in the event of liquidation other typical features include convertibility into common stock callable at the option of the corporation and no voting rights we estimate that the average daily trading volume of preferred securities was approximately 519 million in 2011 

  

index to financial statements our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

  

 we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 87 brokerdealer market making clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and over 850 active institutional investor firms we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that our net addition of 38 new brokerdealer market making clients since the third quarter of 2008 has improved and will continue to improve the liquidity on our electronic trading platform for institutional investors further motivating them to use our platform the number of our active institutional investor clients for the past five years has been as follows 

 

  

index to financial statements our total trading volume increased from 3599 billion in 2007 to 5250 billion in 2011 we believe that our trading volumes in 2008 and 2009 reflect the turmoil and resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets beginning in the third quarter of 2007 our total trading volume over the past five years is indicated below 

 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds was approximately 94 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2007 as reported by finra trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers however following the credit market turmoil our estimated market share declined to approximately 62 for the full year 2009 our volume in us highgrade floating rate note bonds declined from 460 billion in 2007 to 66 billion in 2009 the us credit market conditions improved significantly beginning in 2009 our estimated share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume for 2011 was approximately 111 our estimated market share from 2007 to 2011 is shown in the chart below 

 

  

index to financial statements execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 80000 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 60 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the institutional investor institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

  

index to financial statements benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

other service offerings 

in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including 

information services the information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions our corporate bondticker tm provides access to realtime and historical price yield and marketaxess estimated spreadtotreasuries for publicly disseminated finra traceeligible bonds corporate bondticker tm combines publiclyavailable finra trace data with the prices for trades executed on our us highgrade electronic trading platform integrating the two data sources and providing realtime finra trace data with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available our electronic trading platform allows institutional investors to compile sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual informationgathering process or other electronic services 

we offer a comprehensive set of reports designed to review and monitor credit trading activity for institutional investor clients these reports utilize extensive finra trace information and are accessible by means of a flexible interface to run and save reports in a variety of formats for both compliance and management reporting for example the best execution report provides a view of the savings generated by trading on our electronic trading platform and offers a quantitative measure of the value of price discovery from multiple dealers the report allows clients to monitor performance against their own best execution policy our compliance product provides a printed history of each inquiry submitted through the marketaxess trading platform

straightthrough processing 

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations

competition 

the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face five main areas of competition 

 

  

  

  

  

 competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore 291 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

technology 

the design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have redundant dedicated highspeed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure single signon clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

intellectual property 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright 

  

index to financial statements laws we received five patents in 2009 covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology we received two additional patents in 2010 and other patents are pending 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark and trade secret rights 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions we have pending registrations for the marketaxess ® name and logo in several other foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  bondlink ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks service marks and trademark applications corporate bondticker tm is a trademark we use but it has not been registered 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

government regulation 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws one of our us subsidiaries marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer it is also a member of finra a selfregulatory organization to which most brokerdealers belong in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law marking the greatest change to financial supervision since the 1930’s us financial regulators are in the midst of an intense period of rulemaking that is required to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act and market participants will need to make strategic decisions in an environment of regulatory uncertainty among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions as with other parts of the doddfrank act many of the details of the new regulatory regime relating to swaps are left to the regulators to determine through rulemaking subject to such rulemaking we currently expect to establish and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

  

index to financial statements regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation marketaxess europe limited may fall within the scope of those regulations depending on the extent to which it is characterized as providing a regulated investment service 

our principal regulator in the uk is the financial services authority “fsa” our subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility “mtf” dealer with the fsa 

the securities industry in the member states of the european union is regulated by agencies in each member state european union measures provide for the mutual recognition of regulatory agencies and of prudential supervision making possible the grant of a single authorization for providers of investment services which in general is valid throughout the european union as an fsaapproved mtf marketaxess europe limited receives the benefit of this authorization 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european commission has issued three consultation papers intended to help define certain terms in the new otc derivatives landscape and in 2010 proposed legislation that mandates among other things central clearing of standardized cds contracts although the european regulators have not yet adopted such legislation our expectation is that the eu will in line with the us require central clearing of standardized cds contracts and increase transparency through enhanced trade reporting requirements however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

our canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada limited is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had 232 employees 187 of whom were based in the us and 45 of whom were based outside of the us principally in the uk none of our employees is represented by a labor union we consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

global economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and our profitability and business could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will 

  

index to financial statements continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 60 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability over the past three years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond eurobond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives for example as a result of the effect on our eurobond trading volumes of continuing sovereign debt concerns and the competitive environment in europe we intend to amend our european brokerdealer plan effective march 1 2012 this amendment will reduce the distribution fees charged to our european brokerdealer clients but leave dealer variable transaction fees unchanged 

we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans it is possible that our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions executed between our clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back bond trades  

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary and marketaxess europe limited our uk subsidiary act as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure 

  

index to financial statements we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 146 158 and 121 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively this institutional investor client also beneficially owns approximately 5 of the outstanding shares of our common stock the contractual obligations of our institutional investor clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

 as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

  

index to financial statements our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable secure realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we or our third party service providers will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

 any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform our business could suffer a material adverse effect 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations cyber attacks on our systems or the systems of our third party service providers could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information leading to litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures any cybersecurity breach may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a third party service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences including but not limited to 

 

  

  

 our remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm loss of clients and revenues and litigation caused by any breaches we may be found liable to our clients for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

  

index to financial statements we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have received seven patents and have filed patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that the patents applied for will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges 

we may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if there are changed circumstances we assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 

  

index to financial statements determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity compensation awards any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive as the financial industry continues to recover from the financial crisis and as electronic commerce continues to experience strong growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and finra as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

in addition as a result of the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry there is a greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to increase government oversight of the financial services industry for example during 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law the doddfrank act creates an entirely new structure for the trading of overthecounter derivatives a market in which we currently operate among other things the doddfrank act mandates that clearable swaps trade on a board of trade designated as a contract market or a securities exchange or through a “swap execution facility” or sef in each case subject to certain key exceptions while we expect that the cftc and sec will adopt rules that detail the new regulatory regime regarding the swaps market place in 2012 no assurance can be given regarding when or whether such rules will be finalized and implemented subject to such rulemaking we intend to establish register and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

we have incurred significant costs to prepare for compliance with the new regulatory requirements we developed new technology and trading protocols to trade cds in anticipation of the sec and cftc’s implementation of the doddfrank act however despite our efforts there is no assurance that we will qualify as a registered sef or that our compliance systems will be effective if we do not qualify as a sef we will no longer be able to support cds trades and our business financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer as a result if we qualify as a sef the registration and additional oversight that we will need to comply with the regulation will increase the costs of our operations and the costs of using our products for our clients furthermore we are unable to predict how the markets will respond to the new regulatory regime 

any changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations the proposed volcker rule section of the doddfrank act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates the volcker rule could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

index to financial statements our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealers that compete with each other we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our international operations are also subject to the legal economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world including but not limited to the risk of war inter and intra national conflict economic crises and terrorism for example the sovereign debt crisis in europe may have a material adverse effect on our business increased government deficits and debt levels along with ratings downgrades sparked fears in the global financial markets of default by euro zone nations leading to increased yields on government bonds and resulting in a more difficult trading environment for european corporate bonds due in part to the crisis and competitive environment in europe trading volume in our eurobond product has significantly decreased we intend to reduce the monthly distribution fees paid by our european brokerdealer market makers effective march 1 2012 in order to encourage eurobond trading which will result in decreased monthly distribution fee revenues despite our efforts there is no assurance that eurobond trading volumes and revenues will increase as a result of this change 

  

index to financial statements in addition we must comply with the laws regulations and registration rules of the financial services authority in the uk and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european commission has issued three consultation papers intended to help define certain terms in the new otc derivatives landscape and in 2010 proposed legislation that mandates among other things central clearing of standardized cds contracts although the european regulators have not yet adopted such legislation our expectation is that the eu will in line with the us require central clearing of standardized cds contracts and increase transparency through enhanced trade reporting requirements however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and timeconsuming further we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors established local markets and economic and political instability our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if they fail 

our success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel while we have developed policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage our legal regulatory and market risks we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed 

in addition the regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate have broad powers to censure fine issue ceaseanddesist orders or keep us from engaging in some of our operations we face the risk of regulatory intervention investigations and proceedings any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of delays failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

in addition future sales of our common stock or the perception of potential future sales may adversely impact the market price of our common stock if any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a 

  

index to financial statements large number of shares the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected also if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering future acquisition strategic alliance thirdparty investment and private placement or otherwise the market price of our common stock could decline considerably furthermore our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future if we were to cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 

 

  

  

 provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquiror to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

 critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and consolidation or contraction of brokerdealers 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility 

  

index to financial statements dealer with the fsa in the uk marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada relevant regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was signed into law marking the greatest change to financial supervision since the 1930’s us financial regulators are in the midst of an intense period of rulemaking that is required to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act and market participants will need to make strategic decisions in an environment of regulatory uncertainty among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions as with other parts of the doddfrank act many of the details of the new regulatory regime relating to swaps are left to the regulators to determine through rulemaking while we expect that the cftc and sec will adopt rules that detail the new regulatory regime regarding the swaps market place in 2012 no assurance can be given regarding when or whether such rules will be finalized and implemented subject to such rulemaking we currently expect to establish and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

the proposed volcker rule could adversely affect our bankaffiliated brokerdealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixedincome securities thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform 

similar to the us regulatory bodies in europe and elsewhere are developing new rules for derivatives trading for example the european commission has issued three consultation papers intended to help define certain terms in the new otc derivatives landscape and in 2010 proposed legislation that mandates among other things central clearing of standardized cds contracts although the european regulators have not yet adopted such legislation our expectation is that the eu will in line with the us require central clearing of standardized cds contracts and increase transparency through enhanced trade reporting requirements however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we received five patents in 2009 covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology we received two additional patents during 2010 and other patents are pending 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

 we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans for fully electronic trades generally incorporate monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under the fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client 

eurobond commissions similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plan incorporates monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees in june 2010 we launched a clicktotrade protocol in the european market clicktotrade is offered alongside our requestforquote product and consists of streamed indicative pricing in credit and rates products clients have the ability to request a trade at the displayed price with the indicated dealer in connection with the launch the eurobond fee plan was revised and a standard commission rate was established across most types of bonds prior to this change the variable transaction fee was dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue 

other commissions commissions for other bond assetbacked and preferred securities trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the instrument traded we generally operate using standard fee schedules that may include both transaction fees and monthly distribution fees that are charged to the participating dealers 

for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

  

index to financial statements other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from technology products and services information services fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients income on investments and other income 

technology products and services technology products and services includes software licenses maintenance and support services and professional consulting services 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker tm to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stockbased compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

  

index to financial statements marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

expenses may grow in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits primarily due to investment in new products and geographic expansion however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

all accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than one year and are derived from tradingrelated fees and commissions and revenues from products and services we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

  

index to financial statements revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn the commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

technology products and services we generate revenues from technology software licenses maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” and professional consulting services revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we generally sell software licenses and pcs together as part of multipleelement arrangements we also enter into contracts for technology integration consulting services unrelated to any software product 

for arrangements that include multiple elements generally software licenses and pcs we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue the vsoe of each element is based on historical evidence of standalone sales of these elements to third parties or the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period for pcs the term is typically one year and revenue is recognized over the duration of the arrangement on a straightline basis 

professional consulting services are generally separately priced and are typically not essential to the functionality of the software products revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee generally revenue from timeandmaterials consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services within other assets billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years 

  

index to financial statements stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives 

we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

segment results 

as an electronic multidealer platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

overview 

total revenues increased by 349 million or 238 to 1811 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 1462 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in commissions of 333 million 

total expenses increased by 70 million or 74 to 1024 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 953 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits of 23 million professional and consulting fees of 16 million and marketing and advertising costs of 18 million

 commissions our commission revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 and the resulting dollar and percentage changes were as follows 

 

 the 136 million increase in distribution fees for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 was due principally to the migration of seven us brokerdealer market makers in the prior 15 months from an allvariable fee plan to a plan that incorporates a combination of a monthly distribution fee and variable transaction fees and the addition of several new us and european brokerdealer market makers to the platform 

due in part to the continuing sovereign debt concerns and competitive environment in europe trading volume in our eurobond product has significantly decreased in 2010 and 2011 we intend to reduce the monthly distribution fees paid by our european brokerdealer market makers effective march 1 2012 but leave dealer variable transaction fees unchanged we expect that eurobond distribution fees will decline by approximately 05 million per month despite our efforts there is no assurance that eurobond trading volumes and revenues will increase as a result of this change it is possible that our brokerdealer clients could respond to this new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us which could have an adverse impact on our fees

 our trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows 

 

 for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at average monthly rates the 323 increase in us highgrade volume was principally due to an increase in the company’s estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by finra trace from 84 for the year ended december 31 2010 to 111 for the year ended december 31 2011 estimated finra trace us highgrade volume for the year ended december 31 2011 was 29 trillion and increased approximately 10 from the year ended december 31 2010 our eurobond volumes decreased by 265 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 we believe that the decline in eurobond volumes was due in part to continuing sovereign debt concerns which negatively impacted market conditions and the competitive environment in europe other volume increased by 515 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 primarily due to higher agency emerging markets and highyield bond volumes

index to financial statements the us highgrade average variable transaction fee per million decreased from 190 per million for the year ended december 31 2010 to 183 per million for the year ended december 31 2011 the decline was primarily due to the migration of seven us brokerdealer market makers from an allvariable plan to a plan that incorporates a combination of a monthly distribution fee and variable transaction fees the decline was partially offset from an increase in the percentage of volume derived from brokerdealer clients on an allvariable plan eurobond average variable transaction fee per million decreased from 119 per million for the year ended december 31 2010 to 99 per million for the year ended december 31 2011 in june 2010 we launched a clicktotrade protocol in the european market in connection with the launch the eurobond fee plan was generally revised downward other average variable transaction fee per million decreased from 182 per million for the year ended december 31 2010 to 175 per million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to a higher percentage of volume in products that carry lower fees per million principally agency bonds 

technology products and services technology products and services revenues increased by 07 million or 49 to 143 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 136 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily a result of higher technology integration consulting services

 employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 23 million or 41 to 588 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 564 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation of 23 million due to improved operating performance and higher wages and employment taxes and benefits aggregating 22 million offset by a decline in stockbased compensation expense of 21 million the lower stockbased compensation expense was principally due to the cancelation of unvested stock options restricted stock and

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 04 million or 68 to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 64 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation of production and office hardware costs of 04 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we capitalized 41 million and 19 million respectively of software development costs and 32 million and 52 million respectively of equipment and leasehold improvements the 2010 equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures included 30 million associated with the move of our corporate offices to new premises in new york city in the first quarter of 2010 

technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 09 million or 93 to 109 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 100 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to higher expenses associated with production data and telecommunication costs

provision for income tax 

we recorded an income tax provision of 310 million and 195 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the 278 million increase in pretax income with the exception of certain foreign and state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was largely a noncash expense since we had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset the majority of us taxable income we fully utilized the balance of our unrestricted us federal net operating loss carryforward during 2011 which we expect will result in an increase in cash paid for income taxes in subsequent years 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2011 was 394 compared to 383 for the year ended december 31 2010 our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates

index to financial statements general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 20 million or 325 to 80 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 60 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher charitable contributions of 03 million general travel and entertainment expense of 03 million board of directors expenses of 03 million and registration fees of 03 million 

provision for income tax 

we recorded an income tax provision of 195 million and 139 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the 209 million increase in pretax income with the exception of the payment of certain foreign and state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was a noncash expense since we had available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of taxes 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2010 was 383 compared to 464 for the year ended december 31 2009 during 2009 we reduced the tax rates used for recording the deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rates anticipated to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax asset and an increase in tax expense of 16 million the 2010 effective tax rate reflects the 2009 refinement in our state and local tax apportionment methodology which resulted in a lower 2010 state income tax rate our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates due to our net deferred tax asset balance a decrease in tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and an increase in tax expense 

as of december 31 2010 we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of 298 million and tax credit carryforwards of 60 million for income tax purposes the net deferred tax asset of 198 million at december 31 2010 included a valuation allowance of 02 million arising from certain tax credit and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years

net cash provided by operating activities was 655 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 641 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 13 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income of 163 million offset by an increase in cash used for working capital of 146 million and lower noncash stock based compensation expense of 21 million we fully utilized the balance of our unrestricted us federal net operating loss carryforward during 2011 which resulted in an increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2011 during 2011 cash paid for income taxes was 102 million compared to 22 million in 2010

net cash used in financing activities was 112 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 338 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 227 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to a reduction in repurchases of our common stock of 231 million and an increase in windfall tax benefits on stockbased compensation of 57 million offset by a decrease of 23 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and grants of restricted stock and an increase of 31 million in cash dividends paid in 2011 on common stock

net cash used in investing activities was 77 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 442 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 364 million reduction in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to a decrease in net purchases of securities availableforsale of 347 million and a decrease in cash paid for business acquisitions of 14 million during the year ended december 31 2009 we made a 14 million earnout payment related to the 2008 acquisition of greenline net purchases of securities availableforsale were 06 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 353 million for the year ended december 31 2009 capital expenditures were 71 million and 68 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively leasehold improvements and equipment expenditures in 2010 and 2009 included 30 million and 22 million respectively associated with the move of our corporate offices to new premises in new york city in the first half of 2010 

net cash used in financing activities was 338 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 26 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 312 million increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to the purchase of 19 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 300 million under a share repurchase program and an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock and series b preferred stock of 80 million offset by an increase in net proceeds on the exercise of stock options of 45 million and excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation of 19 million

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in addition we fully utilized the balance of our unrestricted us federal net operating loss carryforward during 2011 which we expect will result in an increase in cash paid for income taxes in subsequent years in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business

tableend 

marketaxess operates a leading electronic trading platform that allows investment industry professionals to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments our over 800 active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade in us or european fixedincome securities through our electronic trading platform during 2010 include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios brokerdealers and hedge funds our 78 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading through our corporate bondticker tm service we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions in addition we provide fix financial information exchange message management tools connectivity solutions and ancillary technology services that facilitate the electronic communication of order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds assetbacked and preferred securities and credit default swaps “cds” 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and general and administrative expenses 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 64 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers 

  3 

our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization these are primarily voiceassisted trades a service that we introduced as an adjunct to rfq trading during late 2008 in response to the adverse effect of the credit crisis on dealer liquidity in corporate bonds we act as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved 

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and approximately 68 of the underwriting of newly issued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2010 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 84 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2010 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

industry background 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2010 there were approximately 357 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 74 trillion of us corporate bonds 

the us and european credit markets experienced a period of significant turmoil beginning during the third quarter of 2007 especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes the us credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 and 2010 with net inflows to taxable bond funds and corporate and international bond exchangetraded funds and an increase in the volume of new issues of highgrade corporate bonds compared to the second half of 2008 credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds declined to 11 over us treasuries as of december 31 2010 from a peak of 54 in december 2008 the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by finra trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” increased from 20 trillion for the year ended december 31 2008 to 29 trillion for each of the years ended december 31 2009 and 2010 after demonstrating improved conditions during 2009 european credit markets deteriorated throughout 2010 due in part to continuing sovereign debt credit concerns 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 53 trillion as of december 31 2006 to 74 trillion as of september 30 2010 the estimated average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investment grade and high yield as measured by trace has increased from approximately 141 billion in 2006 to 168 billion in 2010

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last decade which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

  5 

 

european highgrade corporate bond market 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

 

 

 

we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

 

 

emerging markets bond market 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential demand for emerging markets bonds declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the turmoil in the credit markets and the worldwide recession impacted the emerging markets emerging markets bond prices as measured by the jpmorgan emerging markets sovereign external debt and corporate bond indices fell steeply in 2008 but demonstrated significant improvement during 2009 and 2010 emerging markets sovereign external debt and bond indices grew 120 and 125 respectively during 2010 

crossover and highyield bond market 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance was 1466 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 but declined to 430 billion during 2008 primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the highyield corporate bond markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 and 2010 with new issuance for the year ended december 31 2010 increasing to 2730 billion

finra publicly disseminates realtime price information on approximately 12000 highyield corporate bond issues and certain other transactions on a delayed basis trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds reported by finra for the year ended december 31 2010 was 52 billion 

agency bond market 

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding was approximately 26 trillion as of september 30 2010 the federal reserve bank of new york reported average daily trading volume for 2010 of 168 billion in federal agency and government sponsored enterprise coupon securities excluding mortgagebacked securities 

credit default swap market 

credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations the trading volumes and notional amount outstanding in cds transactions grew rapidly between 2002 and 2007 following counterparty credit concerns beginning in 2007 trading activity in the cds market declined substantially and the industry focused on netting down counterparty positions the notional amount of cds outstanding declined to 263 trillion as of june 30 2010 from 622 trillion as of december 31 2007 to address the counterparty credit concerns structural changes began to occur in the cds market that included the creation of cds clearing houses in 2009 that serve as central counterparties for certain cds transactions in 2010 in response to the financial crisis the us congress passed the doddfrank act which is intended to bring comprehensive reform to the regulation of swaps including cds among the most significant provisions of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing through regulated central clearing organizations of all swaps that the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” or the us securities and exchange commission “sec” has determined should be cleared “clearable swaps” and mandatory trading of clearable swaps on a board of trade designated as a contract market or a securities exchange or through a “swap execution facility” or sef in each case subject to certain key exceptions the doddfrank act requires the cftc and sec to complete the rules to regulate the swaps market place by july 2011 we currently expect to establish and operate a sef as soon as the process is established we believe that the introduction of the clearing mandates is likely to result in more standardized contracts and greater price transparency in the cds markets 

although the european regulators have not yet introduced legislation concerning regulation of the european derivatives markets the european commission has issued three consultation papers intended to help define certain terms in the new otc derivatives landscape our expectation is that the eu will in line with the us mandate central clearing of standardized cds contracts and increase transparency through enhanced trade reporting requirements however it is not yet clear whether there will be any requirement in the eu to trade standardized cds contracts on regulated exchanges or trading platforms 

assetbacked securities 

assetbacked securities are ownership interests in a pool of receivables sold by originators into a special purpose vehicle these securities are typically secured by pools of homogeneous assets with relatively predictable cash flows the assets are legally separated from the seller which limits the investor’s exposure to the credit quality of the seller in 2010 107 billion in us assetbacked securities were issued a decrease from 151 billion in 2009 the total amount of us assetbacked securities outstanding at the end of 2010 was 22 trillion 

preferred securities 

preferred securities are equity ownership securities that carry additional rights above and beyond those conferred by common shares the additional rights typically include preference in dividends and seniority in assets visàvis common stock in the event of liquidation other typical features include convertibility into common stock callable at the option of the corporation and no voting rights we estimate that the average daily trading volume of preferred securities was approximately 640 million in 2010

our competitive strengths 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

 

 

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 78 brokerdealer market making clients including substantially all of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and over 800 active institutional investor firms we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that our net addition of 30 new brokerdealer market making clients during 2009 and 2010 has improved and will continue to improve the liquidity on our electronic trading platform for institutional investors further motivating them to use our platform the number of our active institutional investor clients for the past five years has been as follows 

  8 

our total trading volume increased from 3396 billion in 2006 to 4023 billion in 2010 we believe our trading volumes in 2008 and 2009 reflect the turmoil and resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets beginning in the third quarter of 2007 our total trading volume over the past five years is indicated below 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds grew from approximately 85 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2006 as reported by finra trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers to approximately 94 in 2007 however following the credit market turmoil our estimated market share declined to approximately 62 for the full year 2009 our volume in us highgrade floating rate note bonds declined from 460 billion in 2007 to 66 billion in 2009 the us credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 and 2010 our estimated share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume for 2010 was approximately 84 our estimated market share from 2006 to 2010 is shown in the chart below

execution benefits to clients 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 77500 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 70 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the institutional investor institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including

competition 

the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face five main areas of competition 

 

 

 

 

 

competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

  18 

 

 

 

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

furthermore 245 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry

 item 1a   risk factors 

tableend 

risks related to our business 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately 57 of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability we have experienced significant growth in trading volumes revenues and profitability over the past two years we cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate if at all 

  22 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

from time to time we may introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond eurobond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives 

we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans furthermore resistance to the new fee plans by our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients or a reduction in the number of dealers participating on our platform could have an adverse impact on our distribution fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  23 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions executed between our clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back bond trades  

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary and marketaxess europe limited our uk subsidiary act as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume one institutional investor client accounted for approximately 158 121 and 108 of trading volumes during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively this institutional investor client also beneficially owns more than 5 of the outstanding shares of our common stock the contractual obligations of our institutional investor clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  24 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

  25 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

 

 

developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  26 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  27 

 

in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have received seven patents and have filed patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that the patents applied for will be issued 

  28 

additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 

 

  29 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges as was the case in 2008 with the writedown of certain twsrelated intangible assets 

we may be limited in our use of our us net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2010 we had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 298 million that will begin to expire in 2021 a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against future periods’ profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods 

section 382 of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an “ownership change” that company’s use of its net operating losses is limited annually in each subsequent year an “ownership change” occurs when as of any testing date the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company’s stock as compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding threeyear period exceeds 50 percentage points for purposes of this rule certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s stock are aggregated and treated as a single fivepercent shareholder 

the issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders could result in an additional “ownership change” for example we may issue a substantial number of shares of our stock in connection with offerings acquisitions and other transactions in the future and we could repurchase a significant number of shares in connection with a share repurchase program although no assurance can be given that any such offering acquisition other transaction or repurchase program will be undertaken in addition the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock the extent of the actual future use of our us net operating loss carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 

  30 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options performance shares and restricted stock any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

the market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive as the financial industry continues to recover and as electronic commerce continues to experience growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and finra as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  31 

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

in addition as a result of the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry there is a greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to increase government oversight of the financial services industry for example during 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law among other things the doddfrank act creates an entirely new structure for the trading of overthecounter derivatives a market in which we currently operate changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealers that compete with each other we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

 

 

 

  32 

 

 

 

 

 

our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

risks related to our industry 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

risks related to our common stock 

market volatility may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  34 

most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

we initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future if we were to cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

provisions in our stockholders rights plan organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

our board of directors adopted and our stockholders subsequently ratified a stockholders rights plan commonly referred to as a “poison pill” this plan entitles existing stockholders to rights including the right to purchase shares of common stock in the event of an acquisition of 20 or more of our outstanding common stock our stockholders rights plan could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change of control of us by delaying or preventing a change of control 

in addition provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 

 

 

 

provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have severance agreements with several employees and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquiror to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

economic political and market factors 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and consolidation or contraction of brokerdealers 

competitive landscape 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

regulatory environment 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the fsa in the uk marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada relevant regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was signed into law marking the greatest change to financial supervision since the 1930’s us financial regulators are in the midst of an intense period of rulemaking that is required to implement the provisions of the doddfrank act and market participants will need to make strategic decisions in an environment of regulatory uncertainty among the most significant aspects of the derivatives section of the doddfrank act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions “swaps” through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities in each case subject to certain key exceptions as with other parts of the doddfrank act many of the details of the new regulatory regime relating to swaps are left to the regulators to determine through rulemaking subject to such rulemaking we currently expect to establish and operate a swap execution facility andor a securitybased swap execution facility 

  42 

as a public company listed on the nasdaq global select market we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules the requirements of these rules and regulations impose legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming andor costly and may also place a strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

rapid technological changes 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we received five patents in 2009 covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology we received two additional patents during 2010 and other patents are pending 

trends in our business 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

the us and european credit markets experienced a period of significant turmoil beginning during the third quarter of 2007 especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes the us credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 and 2010 with net inflows to taxable bond funds and corporate and international bond exchangetraded funds and an increase in the volume of new issues of highgrade corporate bonds compared to the second half of 2008 credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds declined to 11 over us treasuries as of december 31 2010 from a peak of 54 in december 2008 the trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds as reported by finra trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” increased from 20 trillion for the year ended december 31 2008 to 29 trillion for each of the years ended december 31 2009 and 2010 after demonstrating improved conditions during 2009 european credit markets deteriorated throughout 2010 due in part to continuing sovereign debt credit concerns 

commission revenue 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

  43 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans for fully electronic trades generally incorporate monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain fixed monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments under the fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

eurobond commissions similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plan incorporates monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees in june 2010 we launched a clicktotrade protocol in the european market clicktotrade is offered alongside our requestforquote product and consists of streamed indicative pricing in credit and rates products clients have the ability to request a trade at the displayed price with the indicated dealer in connection with the launch the eurobond fee plan was revised and a standard commission rate was established across most types of bonds prior to this change the variable transaction fee was dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue 

other commissions commissions for other bond and credit default swap trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the instrument traded we generally operate using standard fee schedules that may include both transaction fees and monthly distribution fees that are charged to the participating dealers for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

other revenue 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from technology products and services information services fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients income on investments and other income 

technology products and services technology products and services includes software licenses maintenance and support services and professional consulting services 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker tm to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

  44 

expenses 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stock compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

expenses may grow in the future primarily due to investment in new products notably in employee compensation and benefits professional and consulting fees and general and administrative expense however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

critical accounting estimates 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

  45 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

all accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than one year and are derived from tradingrelated fees and commissions and revenues from products and services we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

software development costs 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn the commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

technology products and services we generate revenues from technology software licenses maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” and professional consulting services revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we generally sell software licenses and services together as part of multipleelement arrangements we also enter into contracts for technology integration consulting services unrelated to any software product when we enter into a multipleelement arrangement the residual method is used to allocate the total fee among the elements of the arrangement under the residual method license revenue is recognized upon delivery when vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 

each license arrangement requires that we analyze the individual elements in the transaction and estimate the fair value of each undelivered element which typically includes pcs and professional services license revenue consists of license fees charged for the use of our products under perpetual and to a lesser extent term license arrangements license revenue from a perpetual arrangement is generally recognized upon delivery while license revenue from a term arrangement is recognized ratably over the duration of the arrangement on a straightline basis if the professional services are essential to the functionality of the software product the license revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance or satisfaction of the service obligation 

professional services are generally separately priced are available from a number of suppliers and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee generally revenue from timeandmaterials consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed 

pcs includes telephone support bug fixes and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements and is recognized ratably over the term of the service period which is generally 12 months we estimate the fair value of the pcs portion of an arrangement based on the price charged for pcs when sold separately we sell pcs on a separate standalone basis when customers renew pcs 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

  46 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee if any varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years 

stockbased compensation 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives 

goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

segment results 

as an electronic multidealer platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business 

results of operations

  59 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in addition we expect to fully utilize the balance of our unrestricted us net operating loss carryforward during 2011 which would result in an increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2011 and subsequent years in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

prior to 2009 we retained all earnings for investment in our business in october 2009 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend the first quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share was paid to our stockholders in november 2009 and regular quarterly cash dividends have been paid thereafter in january 2011 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 009 per share payable on march 2 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 16 2011 we expect the total amount payable to be approximately 34 million we expect to continue paying regular cash dividends although there is no assurance as to such dividends any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors

credit risk 

we act as a riskless principal through marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited in certain transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback bond trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure

marketaxess operates a leading electronic trading platform that allows investment industry professionals to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixedincome instruments our 730 active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade in us or european fixedincome securities through our electronic trading platform during 2009 include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios brokerdealers and hedge funds our 67 brokerdealer marketmaker clients provide liquidity on the platform and include most of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading our dealeraxess ® trading service allows dealers to trade fixedincome securities and credit default swaps with each other on our platform through our corporate bondticker tm service we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions in addition we provide fix financial information exchange message management tools connectivity solutions and ancillary technology services that facilitate the electronic communication of order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us and european highgrade corporate bonds 

 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and credit default swaps “cds” 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues many corporate bond trading participants use email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price 

transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

 

through our disclosed multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading functionality our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 50 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

 

typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however we also execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization these are primarily voiceassisted trades a service that we introduced as an adjunct to rfq trading during late 2008 in response to the adverse effect of the credit crisis on dealer liquidity in corporate bonds marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary acts as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved 

 

our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 972 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and approximately 696 of the underwriting of newly issued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2009 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security in addition to trading fixedincome securities by traditional means including the telephone and email our brokerdealer clients use proprietary singledealer systems and other trading platforms as well as our electronic trading platform we believe that the traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 62 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2009 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the size of most of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

 

industry background 

 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2009 there were approximately 346 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 69 trillion of us corporate bonds 

 

the us and european credit markets have been through a period of significant turmoil since the third quarter of 2007 especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds as measured by the credit suisse liquid 

us corporate index increased from 10 over us treasuries in june 2007 to a peak of 54 in december 2008 the credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 with net inflows to taxable bond funds and corporate and international bond exchangetraded funds and an increase in the volume of new issues of highgrade corporate bonds compared to the second half of 2008 credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds declined to 12 over us treasuries as of december 31 2009 the average daily trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds for the quarter ended december 31 2009 as measured by trace was 110 billion compared to 80 billion in the quarter ended december 31 2008 

 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 30 trillion as of december 31 1999 to 69 trillion as of september 30 2009 the average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investment grade and high yield as measured by trace has decreased from approximately 179 billion in 2002 the first calendar year for which such data are available to 165 billion in 2009 we believe that this decline in average daily trading volumes is due to cyclical credit market conditions including the recent turmoil in the credit markets 

 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last decade which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

 3 

  

 

european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

  

we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

 4 

 

emerging markets bond market 

 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential demand for emerging markets bonds declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the turmoil in the credit markets and the worldwide recession impacted the emerging markets as a result emerging markets bond prices as measured by the jpmorgan emerging markets sovereign external debt and corporate bond indices fell steeply in 2008 but have now recovered and as of december 31 2009 were up 137 and 144 respectively from december 31 2007 levels 

 

crossover and highyield bond market 

 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance has grown from 1309 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 to approximately 1363 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 during 2008 highyield corporate bond issuance declined to 522 billion primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt the highyield corporate bond markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 with new issuance for the year ended december 31 2009 increasing to 1807 billion 

 

finra publicly disseminates realtime price information on approximately 12000 highyield corporate bond issues and certain other transactions on a delayed basis trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds reported by finra for the year ended december 31 2009 was 50 billion 

 

agency bond market 

 

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding has grown from 19 trillion as of december 31 2000 to 28 trillion as of september 30 2009 but is 04 trillion below the total amount outstanding as of september 30 2008 the federal reserve bank of new york reported average daily trading volume in federal agency and government sponsored enterprise coupon securities excluding mortgagebacked securities for 2009 of 182 billion 

 

credit default swap market 

 

credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations the trading volumes and notional amount outstanding in cds transactions grew rapidly between 2002 and 2007 however since 2007 activity in the cds market has declined substantially due to concern over the risks associated with these products in particular the counterparty credit risks as a result the notional amount of cds outstanding declined to 312 trillion as of june 30 2009 from 622 trillion as of december 31 2007 to address the counterparty credit concerns structural changes are occurring in the cds market that include the creation of cds clearing houses that serve as central counterparties for cds transactions we believe that the introduction of the clearing houses is likely to result in more standardized contracts and greater price transparency further regulatory reform in the cds markets has been proposed to address the risks associated with these products 

our competitive strengths 

 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 67 brokerdealers including the majority of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and 730 active institutional investor firms we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that our addition of 19 new brokerdealer clients during 2009 has improved and will continue to improve the liquidity on our electronic trading platform for institutional investors further motivating them to use our platform the number of our active institutional investor clients for the past five years has been as follows 

 

our total trading volume over the past five years is indicated below 

 

 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds grew from approximately 76 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2005 as reported by finra trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers to approximately 94 in 2007 however following the turmoil and resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets since the third quarter of 2007 our estimated market share declined to approximately 62 for the full year 2009 our volume in us highgrade floating rate note bonds declined from 460 billion in 2007 to 66 billion in 2009 the credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 and our estimated share grew substantially during the second half of the year our estimated share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume for the fourth quarter of 2009 was approximately 81 our estimated market share from 2005 to 2009 is shown in the chart below 

 

 

we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the size of most of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

execution benefits to clients 

 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries prior to 2008 the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses was on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1  100 of 1 in yield although in 2008 that range widened to 35 basis points and it declined to 25 basis points in 2009 as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 75000 

 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 70 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the institutional investor institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from information being manually entered into different systems 

 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform this data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

 

other service offerings 

 

in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including 

 

information services the information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions our corporate bondticker tm provides access to realtime and historical price yield and marketaxess estimated spreadtotreasuries for publicly disseminated finra traceeligible bonds corporate bondticker tm combines publiclyavailable trace data with the prices for trades executed on our us highgrade electronic trading platform integrating the two data sources and providing realtime trace data with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available corporate bondticker tm provides endofday cds pricing data combined with cds analytics and screening tools that incorporate cash bond and equity market data in addition corporate bondticker tm provides indicative prices for secondary loans through arrangements with certain of our brokerdealer clients and independent thirdparty credit research our electronic trading platform allows institutional investors to compile sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual information gathering process or other electronic services 

 

we offer a comprehensive set of reports designed to review and monitor credit trading activity for institutional investor clients it utilizes extensive trace information and has a flexible interface to run and save reports in a variety of formats for both compliance and management reporting for example the best execution report provides a view of the savings generated by trading on our electronic trading platform and offers a quantitative measure of the value of price discovery from multiple dealers the report allows clients to monitor performance against their own best execution policy our compliance product provides a printed history of each inquiry submitted through the marketaxess trading platform 

 

straightthrough processing straightthrough processing “stp” refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention our electronic trading platform provides brokerdealers and institutional investors with the ability to automate portions of their transaction processing requirements improving accuracy and efficiency through electronic messaging institutional investors can submit inquiries to and receive electronic notices of execution from us in industry standard protocols complete with all relevant trade details institutional

straightthrough processing 

 

straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endtoend — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention there are two elements of straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing and external straightthrough processing internal straightthrough processing relates to the trade and settlement processes that are internal to an industry participant for example in the case of an institutional investor this includes authorization of orders placement of orders with brokerdealers receipt of execution details and allocation of trades external straightthrough processing refers to connecting seamlessly to all external counterparts in the trading and settlement process 

 

automation by way of straightthrough processing improves efficiency throughout the trade cycle we provide brokerdealers and institutional investors with a range of tools that facilitate straightthrough processing including order upload easytouse online allocation tools and pre and posttrade messaging features that enable institutional investors to communicate electronically between front and backoffice systems thereby integrating the order portfolio management and accounting systems of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients in real time our straightthrough processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of clients we continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle through these partnerships we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations

competition 

 

the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face five main areas of competition 

 

 16 

  

  

competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

  

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

 

furthermore 210 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

 

technology 

 

the design and quality of our technology are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a 

communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed t1 communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface through a secure single signon our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

risks related to our business 

 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any potential growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately half of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

 

we face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability 

 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in past periods and may experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

 

we anticipate that from time to time we will introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond eurobond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives 

 

we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans furthermore resistance to the new fee plans by our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients or a reduction in the number of dealers participating on our platform could have an adverse impact on our distribution fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions executed between our clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back bond trades 

 

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary acts as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks which compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions from brokerdealer clients that were our stockholders for the year ended december 31 2009 141 million or 147 of our commissions for the year ended december 31 2008 125 million or 170 of our commissions and for the year ended december 31 2007 314 million or 392 of our commissions were generated by these stockholder brokerdealer clients none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform reduced involvement of these brokerdealer clients due to the reduction in the level of their equity ownership may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the loss of or a significant reduction of participation on our platform by these brokerdealer clients may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients 

 

we rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform a limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume the contractual obligations of our institutional investor clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform the loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

 

due to the unpredictability of our industry and our evolving business model we have and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 

 

our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to other factors including 

 

  

as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate 

and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an 

interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

  

in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

 

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain 

unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have received five patents and have filed patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can make no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that the patents applied for will be issued additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

 27 

 

  

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 

  

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges as was the case in 2008 with the writedown of certain twsrelated intangible assets 

we may be limited in our use of our us net operating loss carryforwards 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 824 million that will begin to expire in 2019 a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against future periods’ profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods 

 

section 382 of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an “ownership change” that company’s use of its net operating losses is limited annually in each subsequent year an “ownership change” occurs when as of any testing date the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company’s stock as compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding threeyear period exceeds 50 percentage points for purposes of this rule certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s stock are aggregated and treated as a single fivepercent shareholder 

 

the issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders could result in an additional “ownership change” for example we may issue a substantial number of shares of our stock in connection with offerings acquisitions and other transactions in the future and we could repurchase a significant number of shares in connection with a stock repurchase program although no assurance can be given that any such offering acquisition other transaction or repurchase program will be undertaken in addition the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock the extent of the actual future use of our us net operating loss carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 

 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options performance shares and restricted stock any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

 

the market for qualified personnel is increasingly competitive as the financial industry continues to recover and as electronic commerce continues to experience growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

termination of employees may result in additional costs 

 

we are currently involved in an arbitration case filed by a former employee we believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them however an adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations regardless of the outcome of this case we may incur significant expense and management time dealing with these and other such claims in addition we have paid severance amounts in connection with the involuntary termination of employees in the past and may offer severance packages in connection with future involuntary terminations if any 

 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and finra as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

  

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

 

in addition as a result of the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry there is a greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to increase government oversight of the financial services industry changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

 

as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealer that compete with each other we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions these risks include 

 

  

our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

 31 

 

  

we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 

 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

 

economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us andor global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

 32 

 

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

market volatility may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 

 

  

most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

 

we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future 

 

we initiated a dividend on our common stock in 2009 however there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future if we were to cease paying dividends investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

 

provisions in our stockholders rights plan organizational documents and delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

 

our board of directors adopted and our stockholders subsequently ratified a stockholders rights plan commonly referred to as a “poison pill” this plan entitles existing stockholders to rights including the right to purchase shares of common stock in the event of an acquisition of 20 or more of our outstanding common stock our stockholders rights plan could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change of control of us by delaying or preventing a change of control 

in addition provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 

 

  

provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have severance agreements with several employees and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquiror to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

in january 2007 a former employee of marketaxess corporation commenced an arbitration proceeding before finra arising out of the may 2006 termination of such individual’s employment with marketaxess corporation this individual subsequently amended his statement of claim to add marketaxess holdings inc as a party to the arbitration proceeding finra consolidated all of the former employee’s claims into a single proceeding the former employee alleges that we acted wrongfully as a result of and in connection with the decision by the compensation committee of our board of directors not to accede to the employee’s demand for alteration of the terms of certain stock option and restricted stock agreements in order to award the employee additional rights and benefits upon the termination of his employment ie  accelerated vesting of all of his then unvested options and shares of restricted stock and waiver of the 90day time period within which he was contractually required to exercise his vested options this former employee further alleges that he is entitled to a bonus for the approximately five months that he worked for marketaxess corporation during 2006 the alleged damages sought by the claimant total approximately 09 million plus statutory interest and an unstated amount of punitive damages costs and expenses 

 

the finra hearing originally scheduled for early february 2009 was further postponed in september 2009 and february 2010 new hearing dates have not yet been established we believe that these claims are wholly without merit and have vigorously defended against them based on currently available information we believe that the likelihood of a material loss is not probable accordingly no amount has been provided in the financial statements however arbitration is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur

 39 

 

  

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

 

economic political and market factors 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and consolidation or contraction of brokerdealers 

 

competitive landscape 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

regulatory environment 

 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the fsa in the uk marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada relevant regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

as a public company listed on the nasdaq global select market we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules the requirements of these rules and regulations impose legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming andor costly and may also place a strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

 

rapid technological changes 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis we received five patents in 2009 covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology and other patents are pending

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

 

  

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

 

the us and european credit markets have been through a period of significant turmoil since the third quarter of 2007 especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds as measured by the credit suisse liquid us corporate index increased from 10 over us treasuries in june 2007 to a peak of 54 in december 2008 the credit markets demonstrated significant improvement throughout 2009 with net inflows to taxable bond funds and corporate and international bond exchangetraded funds and an increase in the volume of new issues of highgrade corporate bonds compared to the second half of 2008 credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds declined to 12 over us treasuries as of december 31 2009 the average daily trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds for the quarter ended december 31 2009 as measured by the finra trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” was 110 billion compared to 80 billion in the quarter ended december 31 2008 

commission revenue 

 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans for fully electronic trades generally incorporate various monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis the fee plans generally incorporate volume incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform under the fee plans we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

 

eurobond commissions on june 1 2007 we introduced a new fee plan for eurobond trades for the majority of our european dealers similar to the us highgrade plans our european fee plan incorporates monthly distribution fees as well as variable transaction fees the variable transaction fee under the new plan is dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue the combination of the distribution fees and transaction fees in the new plan results in higher total revenue to us at current or lower volume levels if volume grows total revenues could be less under the new plan than the previous plan due to the lower transaction fees under the fee plan in effect prior to june 1 2007 brokerdealer transaction fees varied based on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue this fee schedule applied a tiered fee structure which reduced the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a particular brokerdealer and did not carry a monthly distribution fee 

 

other commissions commissions for other bond and credit default swap trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the instrument traded we generally operate using standard fee schedules that may include both transaction fees and monthly distribution fees that are charged to the participating dealers for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

 

other revenue 

 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from technology products and services information services fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients income on investments and other income 

 

technology products and services technology products and services includes software licenses maintenance and support services and professional consulting services in march 2008 we acquired greenline financial technologies inc “greenline” an illinoisbased provider of integration testing and management solutions for fixrelated products and services in november 2007 we acquired certain assets of trade west systems llc “tws” a utahbased financial software and technology services provider focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting order management systems and trading systems to fixedincome trading venues 

 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker tm to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade 

corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients initial setup fees and other miscellaneous revenues 

 

expenses 

 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stock compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over three to seven years we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

 

expenses may grow in the future primarily due to investment in new products notably in employee compensation and benefits professional and consulting fees and general and administrative expense however as demonstrated by our 2009 operating results we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on 

historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

use of estimates 

 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

 

software development costs 

 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income 

 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions for trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller we earn the commission through the difference in price between the two backtoback trades 

 

technology products and services we generate revenues from technology software licenses maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” and professional consulting services revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we generally sell software licenses and services together as part of multipleelement arrangements we also enter into contracts for technology integration consulting services unrelated to any software product when we enter into a multipleelement arrangement the residual method is used to allocate the total fee among the elements of the arrangement under the residual method license revenue is recognized upon delivery when vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement each license arrangement requires that we analyze the individual elements in the transaction and estimate the fair value of each undelivered element which typically includes pcs and professional services license revenue consists of license fees charged for the use of our products under perpetual and to a lesser extent term license arrangements license revenue from a perpetual arrangement is generally recognized upon delivery while license revenue from a term arrangement is recognized ratably over the duration of the arrangement on a 

straightline basis if the professional services are essential to the functionality of the software product the license revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance or satisfaction of the service obligation 

 

professional services are generally separately priced are available from a number of suppliers and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee generally revenue from timeandmaterials consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed 

 

pcs includes telephone support bug fixes and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements and is recognized ratably over the term of the service period which is generally 12 months we estimate the fair value of the pcs portion of an arrangement based on the price charged for pcs when sold separately we sell pcs on a separate standalone basis when customers renew pcs 

 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

 

initial setup fees we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients may pay an initial setup fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial setup fee varies by agreement revenue is recognized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally two years 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

 

business combinations were completed prior to december 31 2008 and were accounted for under the purchase method the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives 

 

goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 

segment results 

 

as an electronic multidealer platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business

corporate bond fee plan cds trading volume data are included in other trading volume data related to dealeraxess ® bond trading between brokerdealer clients are included in either us highgrade or other trading volumes as appropriate

the us highgrade average variable transaction fee per million increased from 121 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 to 179 per million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the introduction of our execution services desk the introduction of new dealers on the platform that pay higher variable fees per million and the longer maturity of trades executed on the platform for which we charge higher commissions eurobond average variable transaction fee per million increased from 112 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 to 138 per million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to a larger percentage of eurobond volume in products that carry higher fees per million principally highyield bonds other average variable transaction fee per million increased from 158 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 to 203 per million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to a higher percentage of volume in products that carry higher fees per million principally highyield bonds

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 65 million or 148 to 503 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 438 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation of 49 million and stockbased compensation expense of 13 million the total number of employees increased to 212 as of december 31 2009 from 185 as of december 31 2008 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense decreased to 439 for the year ended december 31 2009 from 471 for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 11 million or 138 to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 79 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily due to declines in amortization of intangible assets of 05 million and software development costs of 05 million the intangible amortization expense reduction was primarily due to a 07 million tws impairment charge recorded in 2008 to reflect negative current period operating results and reduced revenue expectations for connectivity solutions principally delivered to brokerdealers for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we capitalized 19 million and 24 million respectively of software development costs and 49 million and 17 million respectively of equipment and leasehold improvements the 2009 equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures included 22 million associated with the move of our corporate offices to new premises in new york city in the first quarter of 2010

general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased by 01 million or 24 to 60 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 62 million for the year ended december 31 2008 higher trade settlement costs of 04 million were more than offset by lower charges for doubtful accounts of 06 million 

 

provision for income tax 

 

we recorded an income tax provision of 139 million and 49 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the 172 million increase in pretax income with the exception of the payment of certain foreign and state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was a noncash expense since we had available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of taxes 

 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 was 464 compared to 385 for the year ended december 31 2008 during 2009 we reduced the tax rates used for recording the deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rates anticipated to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax asset and an increase in tax expense of 16 million the 2009 tax rate change reflects a refinement in our state and local tax apportionment methodology the 2008 effective tax rate reflects a higher portion of earnings generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates due to our net deferred tax asset balance a decrease in tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and an increase in tax expense 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had net operating loss carryforwards of 829 million and tax credit carryforwards of 33 million for income tax purposes the deferred tax asset of 240 million at december 31 2009 includes a valuation allowance of 07 million arising from certain tax credit and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years

the decrease in us highgrade volume was due primarily to a decline in the company’s estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by finra trace from 94 for the year ended december 31 2007 to 66 for the year ended december 31 2008 coupled with a decline in overall market volume as measured by finra trace estimated finra trace us highgrade volume decreased by 90 from 2227 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 to 2028 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer counterparties via the telephone resulting in lower volumes on our platform other volume decreased by 235 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease was primarily due to lower emerging market agencies and credit default swap volume offset partially by increased highyield volume 

 

our average variable transaction fee per million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

the us highgrade average variable transaction fee per million increased from 84 per million for the year ended december 31 2007 to 121 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to the longer maturity of trades executed on the platform for which we charge higher commissions the eurobond average variable transaction fee per million decreased from 138 per million for the year ended december 31 2007 to 112 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 principally from the introduction of the new european highgrade fee plan other average variable transaction fee per million increased from 121 per million for the year ended december 31 2007 to 158 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a higher percentage of volume in products that carry higher fees per million principally highyield

our expenses for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 and the resulting dollar and percentage changes were as follows 

 

 

 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 08 million or 18 to 438 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 431 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was primarily attributable to higher wages of 24 million severance costs of 10 million and stockbased compensation expense of 14 million offset by reduced incentive compensation of 36 million the higher wages were primarily a result of the greenline acquisition the total number of employees increased to 185 as of december 31 2008 from 182 as of december 31 2007 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense increased to 471 for the year ended december 31 2008 from 460 for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 07 million or 99 to 79 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 72 million for the year ended december 31 2007 an increase in amortization of intangible assets of 13 million and the tws impairment charge of 07 million were offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization of hardware and software development costs of 13 million 

the intangible asset amortization increase was due to the 83 million of definitelife intangibles created in 2008 in connection with the greenline acquisition for the year ended december 31 2008 we capitalized 24 million of software development costs and 17 million of computer and related equipment purchases 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 08 million or 114 to 83 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 75 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was attributable to higher expenses associated with the purchase of production and market data 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees increased by 05 million or 70 to 82 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 76 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was principally due to higher information technology consultant costs of 07 million and audit and tax fees of 02 million offset by lower recruiting fees of 05 million 

 

occupancy occupancy costs decreased by 04 million or 117 to 29 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 33 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decline was principally due to exiting certain leased office space in 2008 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense increased by 11 million or 592 to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 19 million for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to higher travel and entertainment expenses 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 03 million or 46 to 62 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 59 million for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to increased charges for doubtful accounts of 08 million 

 

provision for income tax 

 

we recorded an income tax provision of 49 million and 69 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the 44 million decrease in pretax income with the exception of the payment of certain foreign and state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was a noncash expense since we had available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of taxes 

 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 was 385 compared to 402 for the year ended december 31 2007 the 2008 effective tax rate reflects a higher portion of earnings generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions during 2007 we reduced the tax rates used for recording the deferred tax asset to reflect the tax rates anticipated to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse and to reflect changes in enacted state and foreign tax rates resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax asset and an increase in tax expense of 05 million our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates due to our net deferred tax asset balance a decrease in tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and an increase in tax expense

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform the loss of or a significant reduction in the use of our electronic platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce our cash flows affect our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require 

any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

 

we have three regulated subsidiaries marketaxess corporation marketaxess europe limited and marketaxess canada ltd marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer in the us marketaxess europe limited is a registered multilateral trading facility in the uk and marketaxess canada ltd is a registered alternative trading system in the province of ontario as such they are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity based on certain minimum capital requirements the relevant regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying borrowings from its parent or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification to or approval from its principal regulator the capital structures of our subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements the following table sets forth the capital requirements as defined that the company’s subsidiaries were required to maintain as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization marketaxess corporation acts as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in these bond transactions by serving as counterparty to the two clients involved settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded under a securities clearing agreement with the independent third party marketaxess corporation maintains a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash or us government securities as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the collateral deposit included in securities and cash provided as collateral in the consolidated statements of financial condition was 05 million marketaxess corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreement between marketaxess corporation and the independent clearing broker the clearing broker has the right to charge marketaxess corporation for losses resulting from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker at december 31 2009 marketaxess corporation had not recorded any liabilities with regard to this right 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

 

prior to 2009 we retained all earnings for investment in our business in october 2009 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend the first quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share was paid to our stockholders in november 2009 and a quarterly cash dividend of 007 per share will be paid on march 3 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 17 2010 we expect the total amount payable to be approximately 27 million we expect to continue paying regular cash dividends although there is no assurance as to such dividends any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors 

effects of inflation 

 

because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments

as of december 31 2009 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 29 million due to the nature of the underlying positions it is not currently possible to schedule the future payment obligations by period

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as of december 31 2009 we had a 710 million investment in securities availableforsale adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

see also item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our industry — economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer ”

marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities through our platform 649 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade in us or european fixedincome securities through our electronic trading platform between january 2008 and december 2008 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 48 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform our active institutional investor clients include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds our dealeraxess ® trading service allows dealers to trade fixedincome securities and credit default swaps with each other on our platform through our corporate bondticker tm service we provide fixedincome market data analytics and compliance tools that help our clients make trading decisions we provide fix financial information exchange message management tools connectivity solutions and ancillary technology services that facilitate the electronic communication of order information between trading counterparties 

 

our multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and credit default swaps “cds” 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and general and administrative expenses 

 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues in recent years an increasing number of corporate bond trading participants have utilized email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by 

limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

 

through our disclosed multidealer rfq platform our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 36 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients typically we are not a party to the trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other however we do execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and brokerdealer clients on a riskless principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization 

 

our dealeraxess ® anonymous crossmatching service which we introduced in june 2006 allows our brokerdealer clients to transact us corporate and emerging markets bond and cds trades on our platform with other brokerdealer clients our brokerdealer clients can execute these trades in a more efficient manner and at lower transaction costs than in the traditional voicebrokered interdealer market although dealeraxess ® is a completely segregated trading platform it shares the same core technology as our clienttodealer platform marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary acts as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in bond transactions between brokerdealer clients by serving as counterparty to the two brokerdealer clients involved cds transactions are conducted on the dealeraxess ® platform on a name giveup basis and are directly settled between the two trading counterparties 

 

our client base includes 48 brokerdealers including the majority of the leading broker dealers in global fixedincome trading and 649 active institutional investor firms our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and approximately 68 of the underwriting of newly issued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2008 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by traditional means including telephone email and proprietary singledealer systems in addition to our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future we believe that these traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 66 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2008 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the size of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

industry background 

 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of september 30 2008 there were approximately 332 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 61 trillion of us corporate bonds we are primarily active in six segments of the credit markets within the global fixedincome securities market us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and cds 

 

the past 18 months has been a period of significant turmoil in the us and european credit markets especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds as measured by the credit suisse liquid us corporate index “luci” increased from 10 over us treasuries in june 2007 to 53 in december 2008 credit spread volatility in us corporate bonds as measured by the luci index increased from 07 in june 2007 to 117 in december 2008 the average daily trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds for the year ended december 31 2008 as measured by trace decreased by 90 compared to 2007 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer counterparties via the telephone resulting in lower volumes on our platform we also believe that a stabilization of credit market conditions at higher overall levels of credit spreads is likely to favorably impact the volume of trades conducted over our platform 

 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 30 trillion as of december 31 1999 to 61 trillion as of september 30 2008 the average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investment grade and high yield as measured by trace has decreased from approximately 179 billion in 2002 the first calendar year for which such data are available to 121 billion in 2008 we believe that this decline in average daily trading volumes is due to cyclical credit market conditions including the recent turmoil in the credit markets 

 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last decade which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

 3 

  

  

 

european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

  

we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

 4 

  

  

emerging markets bond market 

 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential demand for emerging markets bonds declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the turmoil in the credit markets and the worldwide recession impacted the emerging markets as a result emerging markets bond prices fell steeply with the jpmorgan emerging markets sovereign external debt and corporate bond indices down 109 and 162 respectively during 2008 

 

crossover and highyield bond market 

 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance has grown from 1309 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 to approximately 1363 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 during 2008 highyield corporate bond issuance declined to 522 billion primarily due to the risk aversion among corporate bond investors that severely limited the ability of highyield issuers to raise new debt 

 

finra began publicly disseminating realtime price information on approximately 12000 highyield corporate bond issues in 2005 trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the disseminated set was expanded on february 1 2005 to include reporting of certain transactions on a delayed basis the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds reported by finra for the year ended december 31 2008 was 40 billion

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored enterprise some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding has grown from 19 trillion as of december 31 2000 to 32 trillion as of september 30 2008 the federal reserve bank of new york reported average daily trading volume in federal agency and government sponsored enterprise coupon securities excluding mortgagebacked securities for 2008 of 199 billion 

 

credit default swap market 

 

credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or 

assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations they are often designed to hedge other exposures and can be tied to particular events such as a default bankruptcy or ratings downgrade cds can provide increased flexibility and liquidity for investors and lenders to diversify their credit risk approximately half of the volume traded in cds is index products which give exposure to a defined basket of underlying cds the remainder is traded in singlename cds the trading volumes and notional amount outstanding in cds transactions grew rapidly between 2002 and 2007 however during 2008 growth in the cds market stagnated due to concern over the risks associated with these products in particular the counterparty credit risks as a result the notional amount of cds outstanding decreased in the first half of 2008 from 622 trillion as of december 31 2007 to 546 trillion as of june 30 2008 to address the counterparty credit concerns structural changes have been proposed for the cds market that include the creation of cds clearing houses that will serve as central counterparties for cds transactions we believe that the introduction of the clearing houses is likely to result in more standardized contracts and greater price transparency the total notional amount of outstanding cds is detailed in the chart below 

 

 

our competitive strengths 

 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 48 including the majority of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and 649 active institutional investor firms we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market 

liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that if we continue to grow the participation of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform the benefits in liquidity on the platform to both brokerdealers and institutional investors will be amplified further motivating them to use our platform the number of our active institutional investor clients for the past seven years has been as follows 

 

 

our total trading volume over the past seven years is indicated below 

 

 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds grew from approximately 64 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2004 as reported by finra trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers to approximately 94 in 2007 however following the turmoil in the credit markets our market share in 2008 declined to approximately 66 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer 

counterparties via the telephone resulting in lower volumes on our platform our approximate market share from 2004 to 2008 is shown in the chart below 

 

 

we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the size of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

 

because finra trace began identifying interdealer as opposed to clienttodealer trades in november 2008 we will be able to identify the portion of clienttodealer trading conducted on our platform in future periods 

 

execution benefits to clients 

 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries prior to 2008 the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses was on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1  100 of 1 in yield although in 2008 that range widened to 35 basis points as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 75000 

 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 80 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the institutional investor institutional investors may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to 

create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade we believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs 

 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from information being manually entered into different systems 

 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform these data represent a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients

competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

  

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors and continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

 

furthermore 198 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

 

technology 

 

the design and quality of our technology are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed t1 communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface through a secure single signon our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

 

intellectual property 

 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code 

elements of our electronic trading platform web site and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we currently have six patent applications pending covering certain aspects of our business 

 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark or trade secret rights 

 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions we have pending registrations for the marketaxess ® name and logo in several other foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  bondlink ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ® and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks service marks and trademark applications corporate bondticker tm is a trademark we use but it has not been registered 

 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

 

government regulation 

 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the individual states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation marketaxess europe limited may fall within the scope of those regulations depending upon the extent to which it is characterized as providing a regulated investment service

risks related to our business 

 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any potential growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

 

the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive approximately half of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds the percentage of our commissions from such trading declined from 573 in 2006 to 500 in 2008 our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

 

we expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

 

further decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform would further harm our business and profitability 

 

we have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume over the past 18 months and may continue to experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during recent periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants decreased dramatically as institutional investors sought to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers are less likely to post prices electronically 

 

a further decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

 

we anticipate that from time to time we will introduce new fee plans for the us highgrade corporate bond eurobond and other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives 

 

we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans furthermore resistance to the new fee plans by our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients or a reduction in the number of dealers participating on our platform could have an adverse impact on our distribution fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to certain transactions executed between our clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back bond trades 

 

in june 2006 we began executing riskless principal bond transactions between our brokerdealer clients on the dealeraxess ® platform and during 2008 we extended our riskless principal role to include the execution of certain bond transactions between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we through our subsidiary marketaxess corporation act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform whether on the dealeraxess ® platform or otherwise we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients three of which were also our stockholders as of january 1 2008 who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries the contractual obligations of our brokerdealer clients to us are minimal nonexclusive and terminable by such clients our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities through traditional methods including by telephone and email messaging and through other electronic trading platforms some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks which compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks and most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as investors these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions from brokerdealer clients that were our stockholders for the year ended december 31 2008 125 million or 170 of our commissions for the year ended december 31 2007 314 million or 392 of our commissions and for the year ended december 31 2006 356 million or 499 of our commissions were generated by these stockholder brokerdealer clients none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform reduced involvement of these brokerdealer clients due to the reduction in the level of their equity ownership may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the loss of or a significant reduction of participation on our platform by these brokerdealer clients may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

 

due to the continuing global credit crisis the unpredictability of our industry and our evolving business model we have and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 

 

our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to other factors including 

 

  

as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings 

which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

 27 

 

in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

 

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical 

measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have filed six patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can make no assurances that any such patents will be issued or if issued will protect our business and processes from competition additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 

  

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges as was the case in 2008 with the writedown of certain twsrelated intangible assets 

 

we may be limited in our use of our us net operating loss carryforwards 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1033 million that will begin to expire in 2019 a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against future periods’ profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods 

 

section 382 of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an “ownership change” that company’s use of its net operating losses is limited annually in each subsequent year an “ownership change” occurs when as of any testing date the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company’s stock as compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding threeyear period exceeds 50 percentage points for purposes of this rule certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s stock are aggregated and treated as a single fivepercent shareholder 

 

in 2000 and 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation had an “ownership change” net operating loss carryforwards of 376 million existed as of the date of ownership change however only 52 million 

are deemed utilizable and recognized in the net operating loss carryforward figure marketaxess holdings inc and greenline financial technologies inc experienced ownership changes in 2007 and 2008 respectively we do not believe that these ownership changes significantly impact our ability to utilize existing or acquired net operating loss carryforwards 

 

the issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders could result in an additional “ownership change” for example we may issue a substantial number of shares of our stock in connection with offerings acquisitions and other transactions in the future and we could repurchase a significant number of shares in connection with a stock repurchase program although no assurance can be given that any such offering acquisition other transaction or repurchase program will be undertaken in addition the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock the extent of the actual future use of our us net operating loss carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 

 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options performance shares and restricted stock any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

 

the market for qualified personnel continues to be competitive despite overall economic conditions as electronic commerce has experienced growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stock based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

termination of employees may result in additional costs 

 

we are currently involved in an arbitration case filed by a former employee we believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them however an adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

regardless of the outcome of this case we may incur significant expense and management time dealing with these and other such claims in addition we have paid severance amounts in connection with the involuntary termination of employees in the past and may offer severance packages in connection with future reductions in force if any 

 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and finra as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

  

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

 

in addition as a result of the global financial crisis and other events in the financial industry over the past 18 months there is a greater likelihood of legislative and regulatory action to increase government oversight of the financial services industry changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

 

as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealer competitors we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors in november 2000 we received a civil investigative demand from the us department of justice in 

connection with the antitrust division’s investigation of electronic bond and other consortia trading systems after compliance with all information requests we received notice from the us department of justice in 2004 that the investigation had been officially closed as the use of our electronic trading platform grows and represents a greater share of the trading volume of fixedincome securities the risk that other regulatory investigations could commence in the future increases additionally the involvement of individuals affiliated with certain of our brokerdealer clients on our board of directors and as stockholders may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the united states these risks include 

 

  

our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

 33 

 

  

we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all particularly in light of the recent economic turmoil which has among other consequences led to a depression in stock prices and the tightening of available credit our existing investors including our brokerdealer clients and their affiliates have no obligation to make further investments in us and we do not anticipate that they will do so if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have imposed legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may in the future place undue strain on our systems and resources the securities exchange act of 1934 requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors additionally we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage nasdaq rules also require that a majority of our board of directors and all of the members of certain subcommittees of the board of directors consist of independent directors we cannot assure you that our board of directors will continue to include a majority of independent directors to comply with the requirements of these rules 

 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not continue to increase we will not be able to achieve our business objectives 

 

the success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone 

communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

 

economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

  

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets 

 

risks related to our common stock 

 

market volatility may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline 

 

the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general the market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following 

 

  

most of these factors are beyond our control in addition the stock markets in general including the nasdaq global select market have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 

 

we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future accordingly investors must rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation which may never occur as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock the price of our common stock could decline 

 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business these analysts work independently of us if one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock our stock price could decline rapidly if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 

 

provisions in our stockholders rights plan amended and restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws or delaware law might discourage delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock 

 

our board of directors has adopted a stockholders rights plan commonly referred to as a “poison pill” this plan entitles existing stockholders to rights including the right to purchase shares of common stock in the event of an acquisition of 20 or more of our outstanding common stock our stockholders rights plan could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change of control of us by delaying or preventing a change of control 

 

in addition provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management including provisions that 

 

  

provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations in addition we have severance agreements with several employees and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquiror to pay a higher price either collectively or individually these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

in january 2007 a former employee of marketaxess corporation commenced an arbitration proceeding before finra arising out of the may 2006 termination of such individual’s employment with marketaxess corporation this individual subsequently amended his statement of claim to add marketaxess holdings inc as a 

party to the arbitration proceeding finra consolidated all of the former employee’s claims into a single proceeding 

 

the former employee alleges that we acted wrongfully as a result of and in connection with the decision by the compensation committee of our board of directors not to accede to the employee’s demand for alteration of the terms of certain stock option and restricted stock agreements in order to award the employee additional rights and benefits upon the termination of his employment ie  accelerated vesting of all of his then unvested options and shares of restricted stock and waiver of the 90day time period within which he was contractually required to exercise his vested options this former employee further alleges that he is entitled to a bonus for the approximately five months that he worked for marketaxess corporation during 2006 the alleged damages sought by the claimant total approximately 09 million plus statutory interest and an unstated amount of punitive damages costs and expenses 

 

the finra hearing which had been scheduled for early february 2009 has been postponed until a new hearing date can be rescheduled we believe that these claims are wholly without merit and have vigorously defended against them based on currently available information we believe that the likelihood of a material loss is not probable accordingly no amount has been provided in the financial statements however arbitration is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur

 43 

  

  

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

 

economic political and market factors 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere and consolidation or contraction in the number of brokerdealers 

 

competitive landscape 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

regulatory environment 

 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the fsa in the uk marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary that we incorporated in may 2003 is registered as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada relevant regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the 

requirements of these rules and regulations impose legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may also place a strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

 

rapid technological changes 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis 

 

trends in our business 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us 

 

  

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

 

the past 18 months has been a period of significant turmoil in the us and european credit markets especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes credit yield spreads in us corporate bonds as measured by the credit suisse liquid us corporate index “luci” increased from 10 over us treasuries in june 2007 to 531 in december 2008 credit spread volatility in us corporate bonds as measured by the luci index increased from 07 in june 2007 to 117 in december 2008 the average daily trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds for the year ended december 31 2008 as measured by trace decreased by 90 compared to 2007 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer counterparties via the telephone resulting in lower volumes on our platform we also believe that a stabilization of credit market conditions at higher overall levels of credit spreads is likely to favorably impact the volume of trades conducted over our platform the lower volumes on our platform were partially offset by higher average variable transactions fees per million that were 129 in 2008 compared to 103 in 2007 and 114 in 2006 the increase in average variable transaction fees per million in 2008 was principally the result of the longer maturity of us highgrade corporate bond trades executed on our platform for which we charge higher commissions and a larger percentage of other volume in products that carry higher fees per million principally high yield 

commission revenue 

 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions our us highgrade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate various monthly distribution fees and variable transaction fees billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we expect the us highgrade distribution fees to decrease as a result of the recent merger and bankruptcy activity involving several of our brokerdealer clients the fee plan incorporates volume incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform under the fee plan we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client for trades on our dealeraxess ® dealertodealer electronic trading platform we typically charge a fee to the brokerdealer client involved in the transaction that is based on the size of the transaction and the maturity of the bond traded 

 

eurobond commissions on june 1 2007 we introduced a new fee plan for eurobond trades for the majority of our european dealers similar to the us highgrade plan our european fee plan incorporates monthly distribution fees and a transaction fee that is lower than the transaction fee under the previous european highgrade plan and incorporates incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform the transaction fee under the new plan is dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue the combination of the distribution fees and transaction fees in the new plan results in higher total revenue to us at current or lower volume levels if volume grows total revenues could be less under the new plan than the previous plan due to the lower transaction fees under the fee plan in effect prior to june 1 2007 brokerdealer transaction fees varied based on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue this fee schedule applied a tiered fee structure which reduced the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a particular brokerdealer and did not carry a monthly distribution fee 

 

other commissions commissions for other bond and credit default swap trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the instrument traded we generally operate using standard fee schedules that may include both transaction fees and monthly distribution fees that are charged to the participating dealers 

 

we anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

 

other revenue 

 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from technology products and services information services fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients income on investments and other income 

 

technology products and services technology products and services includes software licenses maintenance and support services and professional consulting services in march 2008 we acquired greenline financial technologies inc “greenline” an illinoisbased provider of integration testing and management solutions for fixrelated products and services in november 2007 we acquired certain assets of trade west systems llc “tws” a utahbased financial software and technology services provider focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting order management systems and trading systems to fixedincome trading venues 

 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondtickertm to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute 

trades on our us highgrade corporate bond platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

 

other other revenues include fees from telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients and other miscellaneous revenues 

 

expenses 

 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stock compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes 

 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over a threeyear or fiveyear period we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of” 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

 

expenses may grow in the future primarily due to investment in new products notably in employee compensation and benefits professional and consulting fees and general and administrative expense but we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual 

results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

use of estimates 

 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

 

software development costs 

 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on its platform that are billed to its brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from technology products and services information and user access fees investment income and other income 

 

commission revenue commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

technology products and services we recognize revenues from technology software licenses maintenance and support services referred to as postcontract technical support or “pcs” and professional consulting services in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position “sop” 972 “software revenue recognition” “sop 972” as amended by sop 984 and sop 989 and clarified by staff accounting bulletin “sab” 101 sab no 104 and emerging issues task force “eitf” 0021 and sop 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” “sop 811” revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable we generally sell software licenses and services together as part of multipleelement arrangements we also enter into contracts for technology integration consulting services unrelated to any software product when we enter into a multipleelement arrangement we use the residual method to allocate the total fee among the elements of the arrangement under the residual method license revenue is recognized upon delivery when vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement each license arrangement requires that we analyze the individual elements in the transaction and estimate the fair value of each undelivered element which typically includes pcs and professional services license revenue consists of license fees charged for the use of our products under perpetual and to a lesser extent term license arrangements license revenue from a perpetual arrangement is generally recognized upon delivery while license revenue from a term arrangement is recognized ratably over the duration of the arrangement 

on a straightline basis if the professional services are essential to the functionality of the software product the license revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance or satisfaction of the service obligation 

 

professional services are generally separately priced are available from a number of suppliers and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee if the arrangements qualify as “service transactions” as defined by sop 972 generally revenue from timeandmaterials consulting contracts is recognized as services are performed 

 

pcs includes telephone support bug fixes and unspecified rights to product upgrades and enhancements and is recognized ratably over the term of the service period which is generally 12 months we estimate the fair value of the pcs portion of an arrangement based on the price charged for pcs when sold separately we sell pcs on a separate standalone basis when customers renew pcs 

 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with sop 811 percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract there were no contract loss provisions recorded as of december 31 2008 and 2007 revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards in accordance with sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” this statement requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method effective january 1 2006 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas 109 a “tax position” includes current or future reductions in taxable income reported or expected to be reported on a tax return fin 48 supplements sfas 109 by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “morelikelythannot” ie greater than 50 likelihood to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date in making this assessment a company must assume that the taxing authorities will examine the position as a result of the implementation of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we recognized an increase in deferred tax assets of 30 million related to previously unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to additional paidin capital of 03 million and an increase in accrued expenses of 27 million unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2008 were 27 million if recognized this entire amount would impact the effective tax rate 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

 

we account for business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we no longer amortize goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technologies customer relationships and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of” 

 

segment results 

 

as an electronic multidealer platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment pursuant to sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business

overview 

 

total revenues decreased by 06 to 931 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 936 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease in total revenues was primarily due to a decline in us highgrade revenues of 60 million european highgrade revenues of 07 million and investment income of 18 million offset by an increase in technology products and services revenues of 78 million technology products and services revenues reflect the impact of the greenline and tws acquisitions 

 

total expenses increased by 39 million or 51 to 803 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 764 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the greenline acquisition increased expenses by 72 million including 35 million of employee compensation and benefits the 39 million increase in total expenses was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits of 08 million depreciation and amortization of 07 million technology and communications of 08 million and marketing and advertising of 09 million

our average fee per million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

us highgrade volume decreased by 356 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in us highgrade volume was due primarily to a decline in the company’s estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by finra trace from 94 for the year ended december 31 2007 to 66 for the year ended december 31 2008 coupled with a decline in overall market volume as measured by finra trace estimated finra trace us highgrade volume decreased by 90 from 2227 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 to 2028 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer counterparties via the telephone resulting in lower volumes on our platform the us highgrade distribution fees were 303 million for the year ended december 2008 compared to 315 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the us highgrade distribution fees may decrease as a result of recent merger and bankruptcy activity involving several of our brokerdealer clients the dealeraxess ® monthly minimum fees were zero and 35 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the majority of the dealeraxess ® minimum fee commitments expired as of june 30 2007 the total us highgrade average fee per million is calculated for each period presented using both the transaction fees and the monthly distribution fees including the dealeraxess ® monthly minimum fees paid by our brokerdealer clients the variable us highgrade average transaction fee per million increased from 84 per million for the year ended december 31 2007 to 121 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to the longer maturity of trades executed on the platform for which we charge higher commissions 

 

eurobond volume decreased by 538 net of the unfavorable effect of foreign currency changes for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 during 2008 we believe that the european credit markets experienced market conditions similar to the us on june 1 2007 we introduced a new fee plan for european corporate bond trades similar to the us highgrade plan the new european highgrade corporate bond fee plan incorporates a monthly distribution fee and a transaction fee that is dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue the european highgrade distribution fee was 142 million for year ended december 31 2008 compared to 81 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the total eurobond average fee per million is calculated for each period presented using both the transaction fees and the monthly distribution fees paid by our brokerdealer clients the european highgrade average transaction fee per million decreased from 138 per million for the year ended december 31 2007 to 112 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 principally from the introduction of the new european highgrade fee plan 

 

other volume decreased by 235 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease was primarily due to lower emerging market agencies and credit default swap volume offset partially by increased high yield volume other average fee per million increased from 121 per million for the year ended december 31 2007 to 158 per million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to a higher percentage of volume in products that carry higher fees per million principally high yield 

technology products and services technology products and services revenues increased by 78 million to 86 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 07 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily a result of the greenline acquisition

expenses

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 08 million or 18 to 438 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 431 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was primarily attributable to higher wages of 24 million severance costs of 10 million and stockbased compensation expense of 14 million offset by reduced incentive compensation of 36 million the higher wages were primarily a result of the greenline acquisition the total number of employees increased to 185 as of december 31 2008 from 182 as of december 31 2007 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense increased to 471 for the year ended december 31 2008 from 460 for the year ended december 31 2007

technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 08 million or 114 to 83 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 75 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was attributable to higher expenses associated with the purchase of production and market data 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees increased by 05 million or 70 to 82 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 76 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was principally due to higher information technology consultant costs of 07 million and audit and tax fees of 02 million offset by lower recruiting fees of 05 million 

 

occupancy occupancy costs decreased by 04 million or 117 to 29 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 33 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decline was principally due to exiting certain leased office space in 2008 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense increased by 09 million or 460 to 28 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 19 million for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to higher travel and entertainment expenses

provision for income tax 

 

we recorded an income tax provision of 49 million and 69 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the 44 million decrease in pretax income with the exception of the payment of certain foreign and state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was a noncash expense since we had available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of taxes 

 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2008 was 385 compared to 402 for the year ended december 31 2007 the 2008 effective tax rate reflects a higher portion of earnings generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions the 2007 provision includes an adjustment to the deferred tax asset balance of 05 million to reflect the tax rate anticipated to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse as well as changes in enacted state and foreign tax rates our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates due to our net deferred tax asset balance a decrease in tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and an increase in tax expense 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had net operating loss carryforwards of 1051 million and tax credit carryforwards of 33 million for income tax purposes the deferred tax asset of 357 million at december 31 2008 includes a valuation allowance of 06 million arising from certain tax credit and foreign tax loss carryforwards this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years

investment income investment income increased by 06 million or 141 to 52 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 46 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents and securities availableforsale balances and a rise in interest rates during the year ended december 31 2007 

 

other other revenues decreased by 02 million or 136 to 16 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 18 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this decrease was attributable to a decline in the amortization of previously received license fees we anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant source of revenues for us on a goingforward basis

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients three of which are also our stockholders who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform the loss of or a significant reduction in the use of our electronic platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce our cash flows affect our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings if available at all particularly in light of the recent economic turmoil which has among other consequences led to a depression in stock prices and the tightening of available credit may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

 

we have three regulated subsidiaries marketaxess corporation marketaxess europe limited and marketaxess canada ltd marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer in the us marketaxess europe limited is a registered multilateral trading facility in the uk and marketaxess canada ltd is a registered alternative trading system in the province of ontario as such they are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity based on certain minimum capital requirements the relevant regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying borrowings from its parent or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification to or approval from its principal regulator the capital structures of our subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements the following table sets forth the capital requirements as defined that the company’s subsidiaries were required to maintain as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

marketaxess corporation operates an anonymous matching service for its brokerdealer clients and during 2008 extended its trading counterparty role to include the execution of certain bond transactions between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients marketaxess corporation executes all such trades on a riskless principal basis which are cleared and settled by an independent clearing broker under a securities clearing agreement with the independent third party marketaxess corporation maintains a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash or us government securities as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the collateral deposit included in securities and cash provided as collateral in the consolidated statements of financial condition was 05 million marketaxess corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its 

obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreement between marketaxess corporation and the independent clearing broker the clearing broker has the right to charge marketaxess corporation for losses resulting from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker at december 31 2008 marketaxess corporation had not recorded any liabilities with regard to this right 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

 

effects of inflation 

 

because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 27 million due to the nature of the underlying positions it is not currently possible to schedule the future payment obligations by period in addition in connection with the acquisition of greenline the sellers are eligible to receive up to an additional of 15 million in cash subject to greenline attaining certain earnout targets in 2009 the amount of the earnout ultimately payable if any is currently unknown

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

 

market risk 

 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had a 352 million investment in securities availableforsale adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

 

see item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our industry — economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer ” 

 

interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to the money market instruments us treasury obligations and shortterm fixedincome securities in which we invest as of december 31 2008 our cash and cash equivalents and securities availableforsale amounted to 1426 million and were primarily invested in money market instruments federal agency issues and municipal securities we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform

credit risk 

 

we act as a riskless principal through our subsidiary marketaxess corporation in certain transactions that we execute between clients we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback bond trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our clients we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk

 item 1   business tableend  

marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities through our platform 674 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2007 and december 2007 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 30 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform our active institutional investor clients include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds we provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions we provide connectivity solutions that facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties and we provide our clients with ancillary technology services our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us and european highgrade corporate bonds 

 

our multidealer request for quote “rfq” trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and credit default swaps “cds” our dealeraxess ® anonymous crossmatching trading service allows dealers to trade fixedincome securities and credit default swaps with each other on our platform 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and user access fees license fees investment income and other income which includes fees earned from our technology services business our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees occupancy marketing and advertising and general and administrative expenses 

 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues in recent years an increasing number of corporate bond trading participants have utilized email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by 

limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

 

through our disclosed multidealer rfq platform our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent thirdparty credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 22 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we are not a party to the actual trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other 

 

our dealeraxess ® anonymous crossmatching service which we introduced in june 2006 allows our brokerdealer clients to transact us corporate and emerging markets bond and cds trades on our platform with other brokerdealer clients our brokerdealer clients can execute these trades in a more efficient manner and at lower transaction costs than in the traditional voicebrokered interdealer market although dealeraxess ® is a completely segregated trading platform it shares the same core technology as our clienttodealer platform marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary acts as intermediary on a riskless principal basis in bond transactions between brokerdealer clients by serving as counterparty to the two brokerdealer clients involved cds transactions are conducted on the dealeraxess ® platform on a name giveup basis and are directly settled between the two trading counterparties 

 

our client base includes 30 of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and 674 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2007 and december 2007 our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 98 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and approximately 82 of the underwriting of newly issued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2007 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by traditional means including telephone email and proprietary singledealer systems in addition to our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future we believe that these traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented approximately 94 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2007 as reported by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to either the total volume of clienttodealer trading or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

company history 

 

marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our fully disclosed multidealer platform began in october 2000 we launched trading on our electronic platform in january 2001 with eight brokerdealer clients in march 2001 we acquired trading edge inc “trading edge” the operator of an anonymous trading platform for us corporate bonds convertible bonds municipal bonds and emerging markets bonds the technology platform developed by trading edge and obtained by us through the acquisition is now the core of our product offerings in august 2001 one of our uk subsidiaries marketaxess europe limited began operations with secondary electronic trading in us dollardenominated and eurodenominated corporate bonds we launched our information service corporate bondticker tm in july 2002 corporate bondticker tm combines finra trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide trading professionals research firms rating and news agencies and other market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond information on november 4 2004 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock in november 2007 we formed a new subsidiary marketaxess technologies inc which acquired certain assets and assumed certain obligations of trade west systems llc “tws” tws is a utahbased financial software and technology services provider focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting order management systems and trading systems to fixedincome trading venues 

 

industry background 

 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of december 31 2007 there were approximately 292 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 57 trillion of us corporate bonds we are primarily active in six segments of the credit markets within the global fixedincome securities market us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and cds 

 

the second half of 2007 was a period of significant turmoil in the us and european credit markets especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes the average daily trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds for the second half of 2007 decreased by 14 compared to the second half of 2006 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer counterparties resulting in lower volumes on our platform we also believe that a stabilization in credit market conditions at higher overall levels of credit spreads is likely to favorably impact the volume of trades conducted over our platform 

 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 30 trillion as of december 31 1999 to 57 trillion as of december 31 2007 the average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds investment grade and high yield has decreased from approximately 179 billion in 2002 the first calendar year for which such data are available to 132 billion in 2007 we believe that this decline in average daily trading volumes is due to cyclical credit market conditions and the growth of debt instruments going into structured product instruments 

 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last several years which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe examples include 

 

  

we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

  

emerging markets bond market 

 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds has recently expanded to include many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential as well as by a general trend toward positive economic and political reforms and improving economic performance in many emerging markets countries 

 

crossover and highyield bond market 

 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds 

yearly issuance has grown from 1309 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 to approximately 1363 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

finra began publicly disseminating realtime price information on approximately 12000 highyield corporate bond issues in 2005 trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the disseminated set was expanded on february 1 2005 to include reporting of certain transactions on a delayed basis the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds reported by finra for the year ended december 31 2007 was 42 billion 

 

agency bond market 

 

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored agency some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the student loan marketing association “sallie mae” federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding has grown from 19 trillion as of december 31 2000 to 29 trillion as of december 31 2007 the federal reserve bank of new york reported average daily trading volume in federal agency and government sponsored enterprise securities excluding mortgagebacked securities for 2007 of 172 billion 

 

credit default swap market 

 

credit default swaps are contracts on an underlying asset that transfer risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations they are often designed to hedge other exposures and can be tied to particular events such as a default bankruptcy or ratings downgrade cds provide increased flexibility and liquidity for investors and lenders to diversify their credit risk approximately half of the volume traded in cds is index products which give exposure to a defined basket of underlying cds the remainder is traded in singlename cds the appeal of these products is apparent in the growth in the total notional amount of outstanding cds as illustrated in the chart below 

 

our competitive strengths 

 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 30 of the leading global securities brokerdealers and 674 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2007 and december 2007 we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that if we continue to grow the participation of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform the benefits in liquidity on the platform to both brokerdealers and institutional investors will be amplified further motivating them to use our platform the number of our active institutional investor clients for the past five years has been as follows 

 

our total trading volume has grown over the past five years as indicated below 

 

 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds grew from approximately 64 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2004 as reported by finra trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers to approximately 94 in 2007 as shown in the chart below 

 

 

we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to either the total volume of clienttodealer trading or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

execution benefits to clients 

 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 75000 

 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 120 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the investor 

 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker tm eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

 

more efficient inventory management the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our 

institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from information being manually entered into different systems 

 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixedincome trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform these data represent a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients

since our inception we have been an innovator in the fixedincome securities markets our management team is comprised of executives with an average of more than 20 years’ experience in the securities industry we have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of fixedincome trading including the existing relationships between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional trading methods in 2007 credit magazine recognized marketaxess as “best multidealer credit default swaps trading platform“and “best multidealer corporate bond trading platform” in both the us and europe the year 2007 was the first year that the award for best multidealer credit default swaps trading platform was included in the credit magazine awards and the third consecutive year that marketaxess has been recognized as the best multidealer corporate bond trading platform 

 

some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include 

 

  

our strategy 

 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to make our current product offerings on our european electronic trading platform available to our 465 active us institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2007 and december 2007 and to increase the number of active european institutional investor clients 209 firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2007 and december 2007 using our us electronic trading platform in each case subject to regulatory requirements 

 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities markets and deliver fixedincome securitiesrelated technical services and products due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new client segments 

 

we intend to leverage our technology and client relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into new client segments for example we believe that cds index trading on our platform will enable us to increase volumes from our hedge fund clients as this client segment is an active user of cds as another example in june 2006 we introduced our dealeraxess ® service which allows our brokerdealer clients to transact us corporate bond emerging markets bond and cds trades on our platform with other brokerdealer clients 

 

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings 

 

we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we also plan to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we are continually considering the introduction of new trading techniques as an example we have the technology necessary to offer an anonymous trading protocol that could be exported to other markets and sectors of fixedincome securities if and when client demand for such a product arises 

 

expand our data and information services offerings 

 

we regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondticker tm in order to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients examples of added content include pricing for credit derivatives and syndicated loans and independent thirdparty credit research we intend to continue to widen the user base of our data products and to continue adding new content and analytical capabilities in november 2006 we introduced compliance reporting tools for our institutional investor clients that assist them in monitoring best execution requirements for fixedincome trades as the use of our electronic trading platform continues to grow we believe that the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will also increase further enhancing the value of our information services offerings to our clients 

 

pursue strategic alliances and select acquisitions 

 

we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients for example in november 2007 we acquired substantially all the assets of tws a financial software and technology services provider focused on providing gateway adapters for connecting order management systems and trading systems to fixedincome trading venues

dependence on our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

revenues 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions and overall revenues from brokerdealer clients that are or whose affiliates are also our stockholders “stockholder brokerdealer clients” for 2007 a total of seven dealers and for 2006 and 2005 a total of nine dealers were considered to be stockholder brokerdealer clients affiliates of most of our brokerdealer clients are also among our institutional investor clients information relating to the percentage of our commissions and total revenues generated by the stockholder brokerdealer clients is provided in the chart below 

 

 

 

as of january 1 2007 we believe these seven brokerdealer clients owned 12979397 shares or 374 of our common stock on a diluted basis assuming conversion of our nonvoting common stock and exercise of warrants into common stock to the extent that some or all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote similarly they are likely to be able to influence decisions requiring approval by our stockholders 

 

our brokerdealer clients are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors for more information see “item 1a risk factors  — risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders — we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients seven of which were also our stockholders as of january 1 2007 who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors” 

 

board of directors 

 

we currently have 11 directors nine of whom are not our employees of the nine nonemployee directors two are employees of entities that are affiliates of brokerdealer clients and stockholders of marketaxess although these entities do not have the contractual right to designate members of our board of directors 

 

other businesses 

 

our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by means other than our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including the telephone email messaging and other electronic means of communication including proprietary singledealer systems 

we cannot be assured that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors other companies including some in which certain of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

 

conflicts of interest 

 

for information concerning the potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the various roles brokerdealer client and stockholder played by certain of our brokerdealer clients please see “item 1a risk factors  — risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders” 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force is responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our platform by our existing clients their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use the system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixedincome trading platform we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing promotional mailings and participation in industry conferences to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform for example we have worked with the wall street journal to establish corporate bondticker tm as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and highyield tables 

 

competition 

 

the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 

 

 18 

  

competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

  

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume has grown over the past five years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building api’s with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

 

furthermore approximately 150 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry 

 

technology 

 

the design and quality of our technology are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume 

 

all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in case the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed t1 communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface through a secure single signon our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

 

intellectual property 

 

we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform web site and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we currently have six patent applications pending covering certain aspects of our business 

 

the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark or trade secret rights 

 

we have obtained us federal registration of the marketaxess ® name and logo and the same mark and logo have been registered in several foreign jurisdictions we have pending registrations for the marketaxess ® name and logo in several other foreign jurisdictions in addition we have obtained us federal registration for the marks autospotting ®  bondlink ®  frontpage ®  actives ®  dealeraxess ® and associated designs corporate bondticker tm is a trademark we use but it has not been registered 

 

in addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product and service developments frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position 

 

government regulation 

 

the securities industry and financial markets in the us and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation as a matter of public policy regulatory bodies in the us and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets our active brokerdealer subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations 

 

regulation of the us securities industry and brokerdealers 

 

in the us the sec is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is registered with the sec as a brokerdealer it is also a member of finra a selfregulatory organization to which most brokerdealers belong in addition marketaxess corporation is a member of the securities investor protection corporation which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a brokerdealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the brokerdealer 

 

additionally marketaxess corporation is registered with certain states and the district of columbia as a brokerdealer the states and the district of columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws rules and regulations 

 

regulation of the nonus securities industries and investment service providers 

 

the securities industry and financial markets in the uk the european union and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation marketaxess europe limited may fall within the scope of those regulations depending upon the extent to which it is characterized as providing a regulated investment service

risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients seven of which were also our stockholders as of january 1 2007 who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries although each brokerdealer client is currently a party to an agreement with us the obligations of each brokerdealer under these agreements are minimal none of these agreements is exclusive and brokerdealers may terminate such agreements andor enter into and in some cases have entered into similar agreements with our competitors for example some of our brokerdealer clients are also clients of thomson tradeweb a multidealer to institutional investor trading platform that operates an online corporate bond trading platform 

 

our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including telephone conversations email messaging and other electronic means of communication currently the preponderance of trading of us highgrade corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading methods most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as equity holders and such ventures or newly created ventures may compete with us and our electronic trading platform now and in the future 

 

some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading networks these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us including either individually or collectively organizing or investing in a separate company similar to us for the purpose of competing with us or pursuing corporate opportunities that might be attractive to us accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions from brokerdealer clients that were our stockholders for the year ended december 31 2007 314 million or 392 of our commissions for the year ended december 31 2006 356 million or 499 of our commissions and for the year ended december 31 2005 366 million or 547 of our commissions were generated by these stockholder brokerdealer clients none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform reduced involvement of these brokerdealer clients due to the reduction in the level of their equity ownership may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the loss of or a significant reduction of participation on our platform by these brokerdealer clients may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

several of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that differ from those of our other stockholders 

 

as of january 1 2007 seven of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates owned in the aggregate a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that may be different from ours and those of our other stockholders for example in their capacity as brokerdealer clients they would presumably favor lower commissions andor commission caps furthermore as stockholders in other consortia that have developed competitive electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of competitive electronic trading networks they may decide to direct some or all of their electronic trading business to one or more of our competitors while these actions if taken would presumably reduce our revenues and our market capitalization and therefore the value of their ownership position in us there can be no assurance that they will not decide to take such actions for their own strategic reasons 

 

we are not a party to any voting agreement with any of our stockholders and are not aware of any voting agreements among our brokerdealer clients however they may enter into a voting agreement in the future or otherwise vote in a similar manner to the extent that all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote similarly they will be able to determine decisions requiring approval by our stockholders as a result they or their affiliates may be able to 

 

  

as a result of these factors we may be less likely to pursue relationships with strategic partners who are not stockholders of ours which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position furthermore these factors could also limit stockholder value by preventing a change in control or sale of marketaxess 

 

we may be limited in our use of our us net operating loss carryforwards 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had us net operating loss carryforwards of 1008 million that will begin to expire in 2019 a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against future periods’ profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods 

 

section 382 of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an “ownership change” that company’s use of its net operating losses is limited annually in each subsequent year an “ownership change” occurs when as of any testing date the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company’s stock as compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding threeyear period exceeds 50 percentage points for purposes of this rule certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s stock are aggregated and treated as a single fivepercent shareholder 

 

in 2000 and 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation had an “ownership change” net operating loss carryforwards of 392 million existed as of the date of ownership change however only 68 million are deemed utilizable and recognized in the net operating loss carryforward figure in 2007 marketaxess holdings inc experienced an ownership change we do not believe that this ownership change significantly impacts our ability to utilize existing net operating loss carryforwards 

 

the issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders could result in an additional “ownership change” for example we may issue a substantial number of shares of our stock in connection with offerings acquisitions and other transactions in the future and we could repurchase a significant number of shares in connection with a stock repurchase program although no assurance can be given that any such offering acquisition other transaction or repurchase program will be undertaken in addition the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock the extent of the actual future use of our us net operating loss 

carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor our historical growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

 

the use of our electronic trading platform is relatively new the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive a majority of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds the percentage of our commissions from such trading remained relatively constant for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability 

our plans to pursue other opportunities for revenue growth are at an early stage and we cannot assure you that our plans will be successful or that we will actually proceed with them as described 

 

because we operate in a rapidly evolving industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

 

we expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform could harm our business and profitability 

 

we have experienced decreases in overall trading volume in certain periods and may experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers may be less likely to post prices electronically 

 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

 

on june 1 2005 we introduced a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in us highgrade corporate bonds executed on our electronic trading platform on june 1 2007 we introduced a new fee plan for european highgrade corporate bonds for the majority of our european dealers the european dealers signed new oneyear agreements in addition we anticipate that from time to time we will introduce new fee plans for the other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives 

we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans furthermore resistance to the new fee plans by our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to transactions executed between our brokerdealer clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back bond trades 

 

in june 2006 we began executing riskless principal bond transactions between our brokerdealer clients through our subsidiary marketaxess corporation we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our brokerdealer clients executing bond trades on the dealeraxess ® platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk 

 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

 

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 

 

our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to other factors including 

 

  

as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business 

risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

  

in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

 

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have filed six patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can make no assurances that any such patents will be issued or if issued will protect our business and processes from competition additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our 

business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 

  

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be 

required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options performance shares and restricted stock any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

 

the market for qualified personnel has grown more competitive in recent periods as electronic commerce has experienced growth many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stock based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

termination of employees may result in additional costs 

 

we are currently involved in arbitration claims filed by two former employees we believe that both cases are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend them however an adverse settlement or judgment related to those or similar types of claims may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations regardless of the outcome of these claims we may incur significant expense and management time dealing with such claims 

 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and finra as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

 

  

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in finra and registration as a brokerdealer 

 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as a multilateral trading facility respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

 

changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

 

as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealer competitors we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors in november 2000 we received a civil investigative demand from the us department of justice in connection with the antitrust division’s investigation of electronic bond and other consortia trading systems after compliance with all information requests we received notice from the us department of justice in 2004 that the investigation had been officially closed as the use of our electronic trading platform grows and represents a greater share of the trading volume of fixedincome securities the risk that other regulatory investigations could commence in the future increases additionally the involvement of individuals affiliated with certain of our brokerdealer clients on our board of directors and as stockholders may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the united states these risks include 

 

  

our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements historically we have satisfied these needs primarily through equity financing from certain of our brokerdealer clients our acquisition of trading edge inc internally generated funds and our initial public offering although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

  

we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all our existing investors including our brokerdealer clients and their affiliates have no obligation to make further investments in us and we do not anticipate that they will do so if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may place undue strain on our systems and resources the securities exchange act of 1934 requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors additionally we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage nasdaq rules also require that a majority of our board of directors and all of certain subcommittees of the board of directors consist of independent directors we cannot assure you that our board of directors will continue to include a majority of independent directors to comply with the requirements of these rules 

 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not continue to increase we will not be able to achieve our business objectives 

 

the success of our business plan depends on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

 

economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

 35 

 

  

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

in january 2007 two former employees commenced arbitration proceedings against marketaxess corporation before finra arising out of the expiration of certain vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted shares issued to them in april 2007 one of those former employees brought a separate finra arbitration against marketaxess holdings inc based on the same claim he had filed against marketaxess corporation the arbitrations brought by that employee against both marketaxess corporation and marketaxess holdings inc have been consolidated before finra the claims made by these two former employees total 45 million plus interest 

 

one former employee has alleged that we wrongfully prevented him from exercising his vested options when he sought to do so and that we wrongfully claimed that such options had expired on the previous day 

 

the other former employee has alleged that we wrongfully failed to accelerate the vesting of his then unvested options and restricted shares upon his termination and to waive the 90day time period within which he was required to exercise his vested options he further alleges that he is entitled to a bonus for the approximately five months that he worked for us during 2006 

 

marketaxess corporation answered both arbitration claims brought against it we have vigorously defended the claims brought against both marketaxess corporation and marketaxess holdings inc based on currently available information we believe that the likelihood of a material loss is not probable accordingly no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements however arbitration is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

 

economic political and market factors 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include among others credit market conditions the current interest rate environment including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates and economic and political conditions in the united states europe and elsewhere 

 

competitive landscape 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future sources of competition for us will continue to include among others bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multidealer trading companies competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including among others the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform and the quality and speed of execution we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the past five years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

regulatory environment 

 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of finra our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as a multilateral trading facility dealer with the fsa in the uk both us and uk regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary that we incorporated in may 2003 has applied for registration as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is in the process of seeking approval for membership with the investment dealers association of canada 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

 

rapid technological changes 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services develop andor license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a costeffective and timely basis 

 

trends in our business 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions earned by us 

 

  

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

 

the second half of 2007 was a period of significant turmoil in the us and european credit markets especially in shortterm funding and floating rate note instruments a widespread retrenchment in the credit markets resulted in increased credit spreads and significantly higher credit spread volatility across a wide range of asset classes the average daily trading volume of us highgrade corporate bonds for the second half of 2007 decreased by 14 compared to the second half of 2006 we believe the resultant lack of liquidity in the credit markets led institutional investors to reduce overall bond trading activity and conduct a higher percentage of their trades directly with their brokerdealer counterparties resulting in lower volumes on our platform we also believe that a stabilization in credit market conditions at higher overall levels of credit spreads is likely to favorably impact the volume of trades conducted over our platform 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions and overall revenues from brokerdealer clients that are or whose affiliates are our stockholders for 2007 a total of seven dealers and for 2006 and 2005 a total of nine dealers were considered to be stockholder brokerdealer clients the percentage of our revenues derived from our stockholder brokerdealer clients has been declining due to the sale of shares of our common stock since our initial public offering in november 2004 by several of our founding dealers for the year ended december 31 2007 the percentage decreased to 371 from 460 for the year ended december 31 2006 

affiliates of most of our brokerdealer clients are also among our institutional investor clients a table detailing the amount of our revenues generated by the stockholder brokerdealer clients and their respective affiliates as well as the corresponding percentage of the respective revenue line item is provided below for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

commission revenue trends 

 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

us highgrade corporate bond commissions on june 1 2005 we introduced a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in us highgrade corporate bonds executed on our institutional client to multidealer electronic trading platform the fee plan incorporates higher fixed monthly fees and lower variable fees for our brokerdealer clients than the previous us highgrade corporate transaction fee plans and incorporates volume incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform under the fee plan we electronically add the variable fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client but do not charge for inquiries that an institutional investor client sends to a single brokerdealer client the combination of higher fixed and lower variable fees in the plan results in higher total revenue to us at current or lower volume levels if volume grows total revenues could be less under the new plan than the previous plan due to the lower variable fees for trades on our dealeraxess ® dealertodealer electronic trading platform we typically charge a fee to the brokerdealer client involved in the transaction that is based on the size of the transaction and the maturity of the bond traded monthly minimum fees applied to certain dealers participating on the dealeraxess ® platform in their first year of trading the majority of the dealeraxess ® monthly minimum commitments expired as of june 30 2007 

 

european highgrade corporate bond commissions on june 1 2007 we introduced a new fee plan for european highgrade corporate bond trades for the majority of our european dealers similar to the us highgrade plan the new european highgrade corporate bond fee plan incorporates fixed monthly fees and a variable fee that is lower than the transaction fee under the previous european highgrade plan and incorporates incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform the variable 

fee under the new plan is dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue the combination of the fixed and variable fees in the new plan results in higher total revenue to us at current or lower volume levels if volume grows total revenues could be less under the new plan than the previous plan due to the lower variable fees under the fee plan in effect prior to june 1 2007 brokerdealer transaction fees varied based on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue this fee schedule applied a tiered fee structure which reduced the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a particular brokerdealer and did not carry a fixed monthly fee 

 

other commissions commissions for other bond and credit default swap trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the instrument traded we generally operate using standard fee schedules that may include both variable transaction fees and fixed monthly fees that are charged to the participating dealers 

 

we anticipate that some reduction in average fees per million may occur in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

 

other revenue trends 

 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from information services fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients license fees income on investments and other services 

 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker tm to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our us highgrade corporate bond platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

 

license fees license fees consist of fees received from brokerdealer clients for access to our trading platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients generally pay an initial license fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial setup costs incurred to enable a brokerdealer to begin using our electronic trading platform the license fee is recognized in the first three months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the setup costs that we incur and the remaining amount is amortized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally three years we anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant source of revenues for us on a goingforward basis 

 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments 

 

other other revenues consist of telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients and other miscellaneous revenues in 2007 we also began providing technology consulting services and through our acquisition of tws in november 2007 certain connectivity solutions 

 

expense trends 

 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stock compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes effective january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees based on estimated fair values 

 

depreciation and amortization we depreciate our computer hardware and related software office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over a threeyear period we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

 

occupancy occupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent utilities and commercial rent tax 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment board of directors expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

 

we anticipate expense growth in the future primarily due to investment in new products notably in employee compensation and benefits professional and consulting fees and general and administrative expense but we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

use of estimates 

 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified 

 

software development costs 

 

we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we 

capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from monthly distribution fees and commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and user access fees license fees investment income and other services other income includes revenues from technology licenses maintenance and consulting services commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients generally pay an initial license fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial setup costs incurred to enable a brokerdealer to begin using our electronic trading platform revenue is recognized in the first three months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the setup costs incurred 50 in the first month 40 in the second month and 10 in the third month and the remaining amount is deferred and recognized ratably over the initial term of the agreement which is generally three years we anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant source of revenues on a goingforward basis 

 

revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services are recognized on the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with statement of position 811 “accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts” percentageofcompletion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract there were no contract loss provisions recorded as of december 31 2007 revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we measure and recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards in accordance with sfas 123r this statement requires that compensation expense for all sharebased awards be recognized based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date these costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period with an offsetting increase to additional paidin capital we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method effective january 1 2006 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas 109 a “tax position” includes current or future reductions in taxable income reported or expected to be reported on a tax return fin 48 supplements sfas 109 by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the interpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “morelikelythannot” ie greater than 50 likelihood to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date in making this assessment a company must assume that the taxing authorities will examine the position as a result of the implementation of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we recognized an increase in deferred tax assets of 30 million related to previously unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to additional paidin capital of 03 million and an increase in accrued expenses of 27 million unrecognized tax benefits as of january 1 2007 and december 31 2007 were 27 million if recognized this entire amount would impact the effective tax rate in accordance with fin 48 certain deferred tax assets aggregating 141 million were no longer recognized and the related valuation allowance was reversed 

 

business combinations goodwill and intangibles assets 

 

we account for business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” the total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates growth rates and asset lives 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we no longer amortize goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives we perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances change intangible assets with definite lives including purchased technology and other intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives of five years intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of” 

 

segment results 

 

as an electronic multidealer platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment pursuant to sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business

total revenues increased by 103 million or 124 to 936 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 833 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to increases in total commissions of 88 million other income of 07 million and investment income of 06 million 

 

total expenses increased by 17 million or 22 to 764 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 747 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits of 10 million

commissions total commissions increased by 88 million or 123 to 802 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 714 million for 2006 the following table shows the extent to which the increase in commissions for the year ended december 31 2007 was attributable to changes in transaction volumes variable fees per million fixed monthly distribution and dealeraxess ® minimum fees 

 

 

 

our average fee per million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 were as follows 

 

 

us highgrade volume increased by 71 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase in us highgrade volume was due primarily to an improvement in the company’s estimated market share of total us highgrade corporate bond volume as reported by finra trace from 85 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 94 for the year ended december 31 2007 offset by a decline in overall market volume as measured by finra trace estimated finra trace us highgrade volume decreased by 30 from 2295 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 to 2227 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 we believe that the credit market turmoil experienced in the second half of 2007 negatively impacted overall finra trace volume the fixed monthly us highgrade distribution fees were 315 million for the year ended december 2007 compared to 298 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the dealeraxess ® monthly minimum fees were 35 million and 28 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the majority of the dealeraxess ® minimum fee commitments expired as of june 30 2007 the total us highgrade average fee per million is calculated for each period presented using both the variable transaction fees and the fixed monthly distribution fees including the dealeraxess ® monthly minimum fees paid by our brokerdealer clients the variable us highgrade average fee per million increased due to the longer maturity of trades executed on the platform for which we charge higher commissions 

 

european highgrade volume decreased by 116 net of the favorable effect of foreign currency changes for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 during the second half of 2007 we believe that the european credit markets experienced market conditions similar to the us on june 1 2007 we introduced a new fee plan for european highgrade corporate bond trades similar to the us highgrade plan the new european highgrade corporate bond fee plan incorporates a fixed monthly fee and a variable fee that is dependent on the type of bond traded and the maturity of the issue the fixed monthly european highgrade distribution fee was 81 million for year ended december 31 2007 the total european highgrade average fee per million is calculated for each period presented using both the variable transaction fees and the fixed monthly distribution fees paid by our brokerdealer clients the decrease in the variable european highgrade average fee per million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 resulted principally from the introduction of the new european highgrade fee plan 

 

other volume increased by 295 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily due to higher credit default swap highyield and agencies volume other average fee per million declined primarily due to higher volume in products which carry lower fees per million including credit default swap indexes and agencies 

 

information and user access fees information and user access fees increased by 04 million or 73 to 59 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 55 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of data sales and higher pricing for our corporate bondticker tm service 

 

license fees license fees decreased by 02 million or 206 to 07 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 09 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this decrease was attributable to a decline in the amortization of previously received license fees we anticipate that license fees will be an insignificant source of revenues for us on a goingforward basis 

 

investment income investment income increased by 06 million or 141 to 52 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 46 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents and securities availableforsale balances and a rise in interest rates during the year ended december 31 2007 

 

other other revenues increased by 07 million or 711 to 16 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 09 million for the year ended december 31 2006 other revenues in 2007 included 06 million in revenue recognized under a technology development contract with a brokerdealer client 

expenses 

 

our expenses for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 and the resulting dollar and percentage changes were as follows 

 

 

 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 10 million or 23 to 431 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 421 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs of 26 million and employee benefits and payroll taxes of 10 million offset by a reduction in employee severance costs of 13 million salary expense of 11 million and stock compensation costs of 07 million the total number of employees increased to 182 as of december 31 2007 from 176 as of december 31 2006 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense decreased to 460 for the year ended december 31 2007 from 505 for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 04 million or 66 to 72 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 67 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was attributable to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs for our credit default swap and dealeraxess ® products for the year ended december 31 2007 we capitalized 34 million of software development costs and 15 million of computer and related equipment purchases 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense decreased by 02 million or 31 to 75 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 77 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this decrease was attributable to lower maintenance and office hardware costs 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees decreased by 04 million or 54 to 76 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 81 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in audit and tax fees of 09 million and technology and nontechnology consulting costs of 06 million offset by higher recruiting fees of 07 million and legal costs of 06 million 

 

occupancy occupancy costs increased by 02 million or 80 to 33 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 30 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to rent expense for additional leased space in new york city 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense increased by 01 million or 77 to 19 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 18 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher promotion and public relations costs 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 06 million or 105 to 59 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 53 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment expenses of 05 million and relocation expenses of 04 million offset by reduced sales tax of 04 million and provision for bad debts of 02 million 

provision for income tax 

 

we recorded an income tax provision of 69 million and 32 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the 86 million increase in pretax income with the exception of the payment of certain state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was a noncash expense since we had available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of taxes 

 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2007 was 402 compared to 370 for the year ended december 31 2006 the 2007 provision includes an adjustment to the deferred tax asset balance of 05 million to reflect the tax rate anticipated to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse as well as changes in enacted state and foreign tax rates due to our net deferred tax asset balance a decrease in tax rates results in a reduction in our deferred tax balance and an increase in tax expense our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings and changes in tax legislation and tax rates 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of 1091 million we have recorded a valuation allowance of 06 million against the gross deferred tax assets of 403 million arising from tax loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients seven of which are also our stockholders who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform the loss of or a significant reduction in the use of our electronic platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce our cash flows affect our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had 131 million invested in municipal auction rate securities liquidity for these securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals auctions for 110 million of these securities failed in february 2008 and as a result we were unable to liquidate these holdings however we believe that other cash cash equivalents and securities balances are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for expected growth and investment needs all of the municipal auction rate securities that we hold are rated aaa by standard  poor’s and we do not believe that the value of these investments have been impaired 

 

we have two regulated subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer in the us and marketaxess europe limited is a registered multilateral trading facility in the uk as such they are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity based on certain minimum capital requirements the us and the uk regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying borrowings from its parent or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification to or approval from its principal regulator the capital structures of our subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements as of december 31 2007 marketaxess corporation had net capital of 215 million which was 203 million in excess of its required minimum net capital of 11 million marketaxess europe limited had financial resources as defined by the fsa of 171 million which was 101 million in excess of its required financial resources of 70 million we believe that marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited were required to maintain approximately 185 million and 80 million respectively in cash as of december 31 2007 to support their minimum regulatory capital requirements 

 

in june 2006 our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation commenced operating an anonymous matching service for its brokerdealer clients marketaxess corporation executes bond trades on a riskless principal basis which are cleared and settled by an independent clearing broker the securities clearing agreement that marketaxess corporation maintains with the independent clearing broker commenced in december 2004 under the securities clearing agreement marketaxess corporation maintains a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash or us government securities as of december 31 2007 the collateral deposit included in securities and cash provided as collateral on the consolidated statements of financial condition was 05 million marketaxess corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a contraparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreement between marketaxess corporation and the independent clearing broker the clearing broker has the right to charge marketaxess corporation for losses resulting from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker at december 31 2007 marketaxess corporation had not recorded any liabilities with regard to this right cds transactions are conducted on the dealeraxess ® platform on a name giveup basis and are directly settled between the two trading counterparties 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

 

effects of inflation 

 

because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had the following contractual obligations and commitments 

 

 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had unrecognized tax benefits of 27 million due to the nature of the underlying positions it is not currently possible to schedule the future payment obligations by period

 item 1   business tableend  

marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities through our platform 689 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2006 and december 2006 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 25 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform our active institutional investor clients include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds we also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us and european highgrade corporate bonds 

 

our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and credit default swaps our dealeraxess ® trading service allows dealers to trade fixedincome securities with each other on our platform 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and user access fees license fees investment income and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

 

traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues in recent years an increasing number of corporate bond trading participants have utilized email and other electronic means of communication for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

 

through our electronic platform our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 19 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we are not a party to the actual trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and brokerdealer clients rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other 

 

in june 2006 we introduced our dealeraxess ® service which allows our brokerdealer clients to transact us corporate and emerging markets bond trades on our platform with other brokerdealer clients our brokerdealer clients can execute these trades in a more efficient manner and at lower transaction costs than in the traditional voicebrokered interdealer market although dealeraxess ® is a completely segregated trading platform it shares the same core technology as our clienttodealer platform marketaxess corporation our us subsidiary acts as intermediary in these transactions between brokerdealer clients by serving as counterparty to the two brokerdealer clients involved 

 

our client base includes 25 of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and 689 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2006 and december 2006 our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 96 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and approximately 75 of the underwriting of newly issued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2006 we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by traditional means including telephone email and proprietary singledealer systems in addition to our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future we believe that these traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented 85 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2006 as reported by the national association of securities dealers inc “nasd” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to either the total volume of clienttodealer trading or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

 

results for calendar years 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

our trading volume commissions and total revenues remained relatively constant from 2004 to 2005 from 2005 to 2006 our trading volume increased by 135 commissions increased by 67 and total revenues increased by 61 income before taxes declined in both 2005 and 2006 compared to the prior years as a result of higher expenses expenses increased between 2005 and 2006 by 77 million or 115 incremental stock compensation expense as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” in january of 2006 accounted for 32 million of this expense increase our summary results for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 are provided in the following table 

 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 575 of our total volume was in us highgrade corporate bonds 258 was in european highgrade corporate bonds and 167 was in other most of which was emerging markets and agency bonds 

 

industry background 

 

fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of december 31 2006 there were approximately 267 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 54 trillion of us corporate bonds we are primarily active in six segments of the global fixedincome securities market us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds and credit default swaps 

 

us highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 30 trillion as of december 31 1999 to 54 trillion as of december 31 2006 the average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds increased from approximately 179 billion in 2002 the first calendar year for which such data are available to 227 billion in 2006 

 

the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb− or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb− by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

 

the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last several years which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 

 3 

  

  

 

european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe 

 

we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

 4 

  

  

emerging markets bond market 

 

we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar or eurodenominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

 

the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds has recently expanded to include many crossover investors from the highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential as well as by a general trend toward positive economic and political reforms and improving economic performance in many emerging markets countries 

 

crossover and highyield bond market 

 

we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds yearly issuance has grown from 1309 billion for the year ending december 31 2003 to approximately 1491 billion for the year ending december 31 2006 

 

the nasd began publicly disseminating realtime price information on approximately 12000 highyield corporate bond issues in 2005 trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the disseminated set was expanded on february 1 2005 to include reporting of certain transactions on a delayed basis the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds reported by the nasd for the year ended december 31 2006 was 48 billion 

 

agency bond market 

 

we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored agency the offerings of these agencies are backed by but not guaranteed by the us government some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the student loan marketing association “sallie mae” federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of us agency bonds outstanding has grown from 19 trillion as of december 31 2000 to 27 trillion as of december 31 2006 

 

the federal reserve bank of new york reported average daily trading volume in federal agency and government sponsored enterprise securities excluding mortgagebacked securities for 2006 of 156 billion 

 

credit default swap market 

 

credit default swaps “cds” are contracts that transfer an asset’s risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations they are often designed to hedge other exposures and can be tied to particular events such as a default bankruptcy or ratings downgrade cds provide increased flexibility and liquidity for investors and lenders to diversify their credit risk approximately half of the volume traded in cds is index products which give exposure to a defined basket of underlying credit default swaps the remainder is traded in singlename cds the appeal of these products is apparent in the growth in the total notional amount of outstanding cds as illustrated in the chart below 

 

 

our competitive strengths 

 

our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

 

  

we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

 

significant trading volumes with participation by leading brokerdealers and institutional investors 

 

our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 25 of the leading global securities brokerdealers and 689 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2006 and december 2006 we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the 

platform of our large network of institutional investor clients we believe that if we continue to grow the participation of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform the benefits in liquidity on the platform to both brokerdealers and institutional investors will be amplified further motivating them to use our platform the growth of our active institutional investor clients for the past five years has been as follows 

 

 

our total trading volume has grown over the past five years as indicated below 

 

our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds grew from 64 of total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds in 2004 as reported by nasd trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers to 85 in 2006 as shown in the chart below 

 

 

we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to either the total volume of clienttodealer trading or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

 

execution benefits to clients 

 

benefits to institutional investor clients 

 

we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 75000 

 

transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 136 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the investor 

 

improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists 

inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

 

benefits to brokerdealer clients 

 

we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

 

greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

 

more efficient inventory management for brokerdealers the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

 

benefits to both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

 

we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

 

greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from information being manually entered into different systems 

 

efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixed income trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform these data also represent a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

 

other service offerings 

 

in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including

our strategy 

 

our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

 

enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our platform and broaden our client base in our existing markets 

 

we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to make our current product offerings on our european electronic trading platform available to our 460 active us institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2006 and december 2006 and to increase the number of active european institutional investor clients 229 firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2006 and december 2006 using our us electronic trading platform in each case subject to regulatory requirements 

 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new sectors of the fixedincome securities market 

 

we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities market due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter new markets efficiently 

 

leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new client segments 

 

we intend to leverage our technology and client relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into new client segments for example we believe that the launch of cds index trading on our platform will enable us to increase volumes from our hedge fund clients as this client segment is an active user of cds as another example in june 2006 we introduced our dealeraxess ® service which allows our brokerdealer clients to transact us corporate and emerging markets bond trades on our platform with other brokerdealer clients 

 

continue to strengthen and expand our traderelated service offerings 

 

we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we also plan to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we are continually considering the introduction of new trading techniques as an example we have the technology necessary to offer an anonymous trading protocol that could be exported to other markets and sectors of fixedincome securities if and when client demand for such a product arises 

 

expand our data and information services offerings 

 

we regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondticker in order to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients examples of added content include pricing for syndicated loans and credit derivatives and independent credit research we intend to enter into distribution agreements with information and data services companies in order to widen the user base of our data products and to continue adding new content and analytical capabilities in july 2005 we entered into an agreement with interactive data corporation through its subsidiary ft interactive data to promote and market corporate bondticker we expect this and other distribution partnerships to broaden our presence in the marketplace and increase our brand awareness we intend to seek out additional market leaders in various segments of the securities industry and leverage their existing customer bases and distribution channels to further our data services market penetration 

 

we introduced compliance reporting tools for our institutional investor clients in november 2006 that assist them in monitoring best execution requirements for fixed income trades 

 

as the use of our electronic trading platform continues to grow we believe that the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will also increase further enhancing the value of our information services offerings to our clients 

 

pursue strategic alliances and select acquisitions 

 

we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients

board of directors 

 

we currently have nine directors eight of whom are not our employees of the eight nonemployee directors two are employees of entities that are affiliates of brokerdealer clients and stockholders of marketaxess although these entities do not have the contractual right to designate members of our board of directors 

 

other businesses 

 

our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by means other than our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including telephone conversations email messaging and other electronic means of communication including proprietary singledealer systems 

 

we cannot be assured that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors other companies including some in which certain of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us

competition 

 

the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 

 

  

competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

 19 

 

  

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown over the past three years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

our brokerdealer clients have invested in building application programming interfaces with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

 

furthermore approximately 100 of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the commitment of these institutional investor clients to our services 

 

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

 

any combination of our competitors or our current brokerdealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future are potential competitors of ours

we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface through a secure single signon our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention

risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients nine of which were also our stockholders as of january 1 2006 who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

 

we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries although each brokerdealer client is currently a party to an agreement with us the obligations of each brokerdealer under these agreements are minimal none of these agreements is exclusive and brokerdealers may terminate such agreements andor enter into and in some cases have entered into similar agreements with our competitors for example some of our brokerdealer clients are also clients of thomson tradeweb a multidealer to institutional investor trading platform that operates an online corporate bond trading platform 

 

our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including telephone conversations email messaging and other electronic means of communication currently the preponderance of trading of us highgrade corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading methods most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as equity holders and such ventures or newly created ventures may compete with us and our electronic trading platform now and in the future 

 

some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading networks these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us including either individually or collectively organizing or investing in a separate company similar to us for the purpose of competing with us or pursuing corporate opportunities that might be attractive to us accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

 

any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions from the nine brokerdealer clients that were our stockholders as of january 1 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 356 million or 499 of our commissions for the year ended december 31 2005 366 million or 547 of our commissions and for the year ended december 31 2004 393 million or 577 of our commissions were generated by these nine brokerdealer clients none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform reduced involvement of these brokerdealer clients due to their lack of a right to designate a member of our board of directors or the potential reduction in the level of their equity ownership if these entities should sell shares of our common stock may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the loss of or a significant reduction of participation on our platform by these brokerdealer clients may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

several of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that differ from those of our other stockholders 

 

as of january 1 2006 nine of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates owned in the aggregate a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that are different from ours and those of our other stockholders for example in their capacity as brokerdealer clients they would presumably favor lower commissions andor commission caps furthermore as stockholders in other consortia that have developed competitive electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of competitive electronic trading networks they may decide to direct some or all of their electronic trading business to one or more of our competitors while these actions if taken would presumably reduce our revenues and our market capitalization and therefore the value of their ownership position in us there can be no assurance that they will not decide to take such actions for their own strategic reasons 

 

we are not a party to any voting agreement with any of our stockholders and are not aware of any voting agreements among our brokerdealer clients however they may enter into a voting agreement in the future or otherwise vote in a similar manner to the extent that all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote similarly they will be able to determine decisions requiring approval by our stockholders as a result they or their affiliates may be able to 

 

  

as a result of these factors we may be less likely to pursue relationships with strategic partners who are not stockholders of ours which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position furthermore these factors could also limit stockholder value by preventing a change in control or sale of marketaxess 

 

we may be limited in our use of our us net operating loss carryforwards 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had us net operating loss carryforwards of 916 million which will begin to expire in 2019 a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against future periods’ profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods 

 

section 382 of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an “ownership change” that company’s use of its net operating losses is limited annually in each subsequent year an “ownership change” occurs when as of any testing date the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company’s stock compared to that shareholder’s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding threeyear period exceeds 50 percentage points for purposes of this rule certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company’s stock are aggregated and treated as a single fivepercent shareholder 

 

in 2000 and 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation had an “ownership change” as a result net operating loss carryforwards of 392 million existing at the date of the ownership change are subject to significant limitations 

 

the issuance or repurchase of a significant number of shares of stock or purchases or sales of stock by significant shareholders could result in an additional “ownership change” we may issue a substantial number of shares of our stock in connection with offerings acquisitions and other transactions in the future although no assurance can be given that any such offering acquisition or other transaction will be undertaken and we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in connection with our stock repurchase program in addition the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock the extent of the actual future use of our us net operating loss carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn we cannot give any 

assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

 

the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

 

any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

 

we have experienced losses and may incur losses in the future 

 

our losses were 168 million from the period of inception through december 31 2000 651 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 361 million for the year ended december 31 2002 for the year ended december 31 2003 we reported net income of 42 million for the year ended december 31 2004 we reported net income of 576 million which included 461 million in income which was recognized upon our reassessment of the likelihood of realization of a portion of our deferred tax assets for the year ended december 31 2005 we reported net income of 81 million and for the year ended december 31 2006 we reported net income of 54 million we cannot predict whether we will be able to sustain profitability and we may incur losses in future periods if we are not able to sustain profitability our stock price may decline 

 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor our historical growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

 

the use of our electronic trading platform is relatively new the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our 

electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

 

our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive a majority of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds the percentage of our commissions from such trading remained relatively constant for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability 

 

our plans to pursue other opportunities for revenue growth are at an early stage and we cannot assure you that our plans will be successful or that we will actually proceed with them as described 

 

because we have a limited operating history it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

 

marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our electronic trading platform began in october 2000 with the commercial launch of the platform in january 2001 as a result we have only a limited operating history from which you can evaluate our business and our prospects we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by earlystage companies in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 

  

if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform could harm our business and profitability 

 

we have experienced decreases in overall trading volume in certain periods and may experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

 

likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers may be less likely to post prices electronically 

 

a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may enter into new fee plans the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate 

 

on june 1 2005 we introduced a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in us highgrade corporate bonds executed on our electronic trading platform most of our us highgrade brokerdealer clients signed new twoyear agreements in 2005 these agreements are scheduled for renewal at various times between june 2007 and december 2007 in addition we anticipate that from time to time we will introduce new fee plans for the other market segments in which we operate any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives 

 

we cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions effected on our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such plans furthermore resistance to new fee plans by our brokerdealer or institutional investor clients could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are exposed to risks resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to transactions executed between our brokerdealer clients in which we act as an intermediary in matching backto back trades 

 

in june 2006 we began executing riskless principal transactions between our brokerdealer clients through our subsidiary marketaxess corporation we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our brokerdealer clients executing trades on the dealeraxess ® platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk 

 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

 

due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 

 

our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to other factors including 

 

 27 

 

  

as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

 

our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

 

our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or 

insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

 

further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

 

we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

 

we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

 

in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

 

we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

 

  

in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

 

  

any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

 

in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

 

we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

 

our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause brokerdealers and clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

 

intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have filed six patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can make no assurances that any such patents will be issued or if issued will protect our business and processes from competition additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

 

we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

 

in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

 

  

we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we are unable to enter into additional marketing and strategic alliances or if our current strategic alliances are not successful we may not maintain the current level of trading or generate increased trading on our trading platform 

 

from time to time we may enter into strategic alliances that will enable us to enter new markets provide products or services that we do not currently offer or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients 

 

entering into joint ventures and alliances entails risks including 

 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into new strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us or at all these arrangements if entered into may not generate the expected number of new clients or increased trading volume we are seeking unsuccessful joint ventures or alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 

  

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

 

the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

 

our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options and restricted stock any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

 

because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

 

we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

 

the market for qualified personnel has grown more competitive in recent periods as electronic commerce has experienced growth domestic and international labor markets have tightened in concert with the continuing recovery in general economic conditions many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stock based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the implementation of sfas 123r relating to the expensing of stockbased compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stockbased compensation that job candidates may require to join our company 

 

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

termination of employees may result in additional costs 

 

we are currently involved in arbitration claims filed against us by two former employees we believe that both cases are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend them however an adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations regardless of the outcome of these claims we may incur significant expense and management time dealing with such claims 

 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

 

the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and the nasd as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

 

most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including

we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in the nasd and registration as a brokerdealer 

 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as an alternative trading system respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

 

changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

 

our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material our anonymous dealertodealer trading service dealeraxess ®  is regulated as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats 

 

as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealer competitors we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors in november 2000 we received a civil investigative demand from the us department of justice in connection with the antitrust division’s investigation of electronic bond and other consortia trading systems after compliance with all information requests we received notice from the us department of justice in 2004 that the investigation was officially closed as the use of our electronic trading platform grows and represents a greater share of the trading volume of fixedincome securities the risk that other regulatory investigations could commence in the future increases additionally the involvement of individuals affiliated with certain of our brokerdealer clients on our board of directors and as stockholders may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

 

the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

 

we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the united states these risks include 

 

 35 

 

  

our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

 

our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements historically we have satisfied these needs primarily through equity financing from certain of our brokerdealer clients our acquisition of trading edge inc internally generated funds and most recently our initial public offering although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

 

  

we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all our existing investors including our brokerdealer clients and their affiliates have no obligation to make further investments in us and we do not anticipate that they will do so if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may place undue strain on our systems and resources the securities exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting in order to maintain and 

improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors additionally we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage nasdaq rules also require that a majority of our board of directors and all of certain subcommittees of the board of directors consist of independent directors we cannot assure you that our board of directors will continue to include a majority of independent directors to comply with the requirements of these rules 

 

compliance with changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted and will continue to result in the incurrence of additional expenses associated with being a public company 

 

new and changing laws and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 impose stricter corporate governance requirements and greater disclosure obligations they have had the effect of increasing the complexity and cost of our corporate governance compliance diverting the time and attention of our management from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities and increasing the risk of personal liability for our board members and executive officers involved in our corporate governance process our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations has resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and increased professional fees in addition it may become more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance these laws and regulations may impose obligations that will increase the legal and financial costs required to consummate a business combination and increase the time required to complete a transaction furthermore in order to meet the new corporate governance and disclosure obligations we have been taking and will continue to take steps to improve our controls and procedures and related corporate governance policies and procedures to address compliance issues and correct any deficiencies that we may discover 

 

while we believe that the procedures and policies that we have in place are effective to address the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other regulatory requirements the expansion of our operations and the growth of our business may require us to modify and expand our disclosure controls and procedures and related corporate governance policies any unanticipated difficulties in preparing for and implementing these and other corporate governance and reporting reforms could result in material delays in compliance or significantly increase our costs also there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully comply with these new laws and regulations if we fail to prepare for and implement the reforms required by these new laws and regulations on a timely basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted our reputation may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected 

 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

 

many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our industry 

 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not continue to increase we will not be able to achieve our business objectives 

 

the success of our business plan depends on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

 

economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

  

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

in january 2007 two former employees commenced arbitration proceedings against us before the national association of securities dealers “nasd” arising out of the expiration of certain vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted shares issued to them the claims made by these two former employees total 45 million plus interest 

 

one former employee has alleged that we wrongfully prevented him from exercising his vested options when he sought to do so and that we wrongfully claimed that such options had expired on the previous day 

 

the other former employee has alleged that we wrongfully failed to accelerate the vesting of his then unvested options and restricted shares upon his termination and to waive the 90day time period within which he was required to exercise his vested options this former employee also alleges that he is entitled to a declaration that certain provisions in our 2004 stock incentive plan are invalid and unenforceable under applicable law he further alleges that he is entitled to a bonus for the approximately five months that he worked for us during 2006 

 

we believe that both cases are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend them we are required to answer move or otherwise respond to both arbitration claims during march 2007 based on currently available information we believe that the likelihood of a material loss is not probable accordingly no amounts have been provided in the accompanying financial statements however arbitration is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur

history 

 

marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our fully disclosed multidealer platform began in october 2000 we launched trading on our electronic platform in january 2001 with eight broker dealer clients since that time our brokerdealer clients have grown to include 25 leading securities firms our brokerdealer clients currently are abn amro banc of america securities barclays plc bear stearns bnp paribas citigroup global markets credit suisse deutsche bank securities dresdner bank ag dz bank ag ftn financial goldman sachs hsbc ing financial markets jpmorgan jefferies and company lehman brothers merrill lynch morgan stanley rbc capital markets the royal bank of scotland santander investment securities sg corporate  investment banking ubs and wachovia securities 

 

in march 2001 we acquired trading edge inc “trading edge” the operator of an anonymous trading platform for us corporate bonds convertible bonds municipal bonds and emerging markets bonds in 2001 we decided to terminate the anonymous convertible and municipal bond trading platforms and currently offer us corporate bond and emerging markets bond trading on a fully disclosed basis only the technology platform developed by trading edge and obtained by us through the acquisition is now the core of our product offerings 

 

in august 2001 one of our uk subsidiaries marketaxess europe limited began operations with secondary electronic trading in us dollardenominated and eurodenominated corporate bonds 

 

in february 2002 we reorganized into marketaxess holdings inc a holding company that operates primarily through two operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation is registered as a brokerdealer and marketaxess europe limited is regulated as an alternative trading system with applicable market regulators in the us and the uk respectively in may 2003 we incorporated a canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada limited which has applied for registration under the securities act in ontario and is in the process of seeking approval for membership with the investment dealers association of canada 

 

we launched our information service corporate bondticker in july 2002 corporate bondticker combines nasd trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide trading professionals research firms rating and news agencies and other market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond information 

 

on november 4 2004 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock specifically 5750000 shares of common stock including an aggregate of 750000 shares of common stock covered by an overallotment option granted by us to the underwriters were sold at a price to the public of 1100 per share the aggregate proceeds to us from the offering were 632 million before deducting 44 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and an estimated 49 million in other expenses incurred in connection with the offering 

 

in september 2005 we launched electronic credit default swap trading on our platform 

 

in june 2006 we introduced dealeraxess ®  which allows brokerdealer clients to transact us corporate emerging markets and highyield bond trades on our platform with other brokerdealer clients marketaxess corporation acts as intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to the two brokerdealer clients involved 

 

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

 

economic political and market factors 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

 

  

any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced trading activity in the fixedincome securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global fixedincome securities markets 

 

competitive landscape 

 

the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 

  

competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that may compete with us 

 

in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

 

 48 

 

  

we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the past five years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

 

our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

 

many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have a substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wide range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

 

any combination of our competitors or our current brokerdealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future are potential competitors of ours 

 

regulatory environment 

 

our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

 

our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of the nasd our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as an alternative trading system dealer with the fsa in the uk both us and uk regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator marketaxess canada limited a canadian subsidiary that we incorporated in may 2003 has applied for registration as an alternative trading system dealer under the securities act of ontario and is in the process of seeking approval for membership with the investment dealers association of canada 

 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

 

rapid technological changes 

 

we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new 

industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 

  

trends in our business 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platform between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platform and the amount of commissions earned by us 

 

  

we believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability 

 

we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions and overall revenues from brokerdealer clients that are or whose affiliates are our stockholders the percentage of our revenues derived from our brokerclients that are also our stockholders has been declining for the year ended december 31 2006 the percentage decreased to 460 from 497 for the year ended december 31 2005 affiliates of most of our brokerdealer clients are also among our institutional investor clients a table detailing the amount of revenues generated by the nine brokerdealer clients that were also stockholders as of january 1 2006 abn amro banc of america securities bear stearns bnp paribas credit suisse deutsche bank securities jpmorgan lehman brothers and 

ubs and their respective affiliates as well as the corresponding percentage of total revenues is provided below for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

commission revenue trends 

 

commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type size yield and maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone and the trading volume executed through our platform by the brokerdealer completing the trade under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

us highgrade corporate bonds on june 1 2005 we introduced a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in us highgrade corporate bonds executed on our institutional client to multidealer electronic trading platform most of our us highgrade brokerdealer clients signed new twoyear agreements in 2005 the agreements incorporate higher fixed monthly fees and lower variable fees for our brokerdealer clients than the previous us highgrade corporate transaction fee plans and incorporate volume incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform under the fee plan we electronically add the variable fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client but do not charge for inquiries that an institutional investor client sends to a single brokerdealer client the combination of higher fixed and lower variable fees in the plan results in higher revenue to us at lower volume levels but will limit revenue growth in the future for us highgrade corporate bond trading as volume levels increase for trades on our dealeraxess ® dealertodealer electronic trading platform we charge a fee to the brokerdealer client involved in the transaction that is based on the size of the transaction and the maturity of the bond traded monthly minimum fees apply to certain dealers participating on the dealeraxess ® platform in their first year of trading which are due to expire in july 2007 

 

european highgrade corporate bonds for european highgrade corporate bond trades brokerdealer transaction fees vary based on the type of bond traded different fee schedules apply to fixed rate and floating rate bonds within the schedule for fixed rate bonds the fee varies depending on whether the bond is a corporate or a sovereign issue for corporate bonds the fee also varies depending on the maturity of the issue this fee schedule 

applies a tiered fee structure which reduces the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a particular brokerdealer and does not carry a fixed monthly fee or fee cap 

 

other commissions commissions for other bond trades generally vary based on the type and the maturity of the bond traded factors that we consider when setting commission rates include those charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we serve and transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone for credit default swap index trades we charge commissions to both brokerdealer and institutional investor clients calculated as a percentage of the notional volume of transactions traded brokerdealer clients are able to select between standard fee schedules that contain monthly minimum commissions and in some cases monthly fee caps 

 

we anticipate that some reduction in average fees per million may occur in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

 

other revenue trends 

 

in addition to the commissions discussed above we earn revenue from certain fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients from license fees and from income on investments 

 

information and user access fees we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our us highgrade corporate bond platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

 

license fees license fees consist of fees received from brokerdealer clients for access to our trading platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients other than those that made equity investments in the company typically pay an initial license fee which is due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is generally intended to cover the initial setup costs incurred to enable a brokerdealer to begin using our electronic trading platform the license fee is recognized in the first three months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the setup costs that we incur and the remaining amount is amortized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally three years we anticipate that license fees will be a less material source of revenues for us on a goingforward basis 

 

investment income investment income consists of income earned on our investments in november 2006 we commenced a 40 million share repurchase program investment income will decline as we use our cash to purchase our common stock under the share repurchase program 

 

other other revenues consist of telecommunications line charges to brokerdealer clients and other miscellaneous revenues 

 

expense trends 

 

in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

 

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries stock compensation costs other incentive compensation employee benefits and payroll taxes effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees based on estimated fair values 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets which consist of computer hardware furniture and fixtures and the amortization of software capitalized software development costs and leasehold improvements we depreciate our fixed assets and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straightline basis over a threeyear period we amortize leasehold 

improvements on a straightline basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware our internal network connections data center hosting costs and data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer we charge our brokerdealer clients a monthly fee for these connections which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees legal fees and fees paid to information technology and noninformation technology consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platform and information services products 

 

warrantrelated expense warrantrelated expense is the expense associated with the allocation of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to warrants issued to six of our brokerdealer clients at the time they made an equity investment in us the warrant program was put in place in april 2000 and was designed to motivate brokerdealers to trade on our platform the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march 1 2004 accordingly we no longer record any expense related to this program 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industrysponsored seminars conferences and conventions and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 

 

moneyline revenue share moneyline revenue share expense consists of expenses incurred pursuant to our agreement with moneyline telerate “moneyline” formerly an independent technology and data company which assisted us in the development of our us highgrade corporate bond and european trading platforms pursuant to the agreement a revenue share was paid quarterly to moneyline based on a percentage of revenues generated on our us highgrade corporate bond and european trading platforms after deduction of identified development costs in the first quarter of 2005 we ceased using the moneyline technology and have therefore incurred no revenue share expense since that date 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of occupancy and utilities general travel and entertainment board of directors expenses charitable contributions provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and uk valueadded taxes 

 

we anticipate expense growth in the future primarily due to investment in new products notably in employee compensation and benefits professional and consulting fees and general and administrative expense but we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

use of estimates 

 

on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to 

the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the historical collection experience and specific collection issues that have been identified additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to bad debt expense which is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

software development costs 

 

in accordance with statement of position no 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” we capitalize certain costs associated with the development of internal use software at the point at which the conceptual formulation design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed we capitalize employee compensation and related benefits and third party consulting costs incurred during the preliminary software project stage once the product is ready for its intended use such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over three years we review the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 

 

revenue recognition 

 

the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on its platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type and maturity of the bond traded under the our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

 

we also derive revenues from information and user access fees license fees investment income and other income 

 

we enter into agreements with our brokerdealer clients pursuant to which we provide access to our platform through a nonexclusive and nontransferable license brokerdealer clients other than those that previously made equity investments in us generally pay an initial license fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial setup costs incurred to enable a brokerdealer to begin using our electronic trading platform revenue is recognized in the first three months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the setup costs incurred 50 in the first month 40 in the second month and 10 in the third month and the remaining amount is deferred and recognized ratably over the initial term of the agreement which is generally three years we anticipate that license fees will be a less material source of revenues on a goingforward basis 

 

stockbased employee compensation 

 

prior to january 1 2006 we have accounted for stockbased employee compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” as permitted by sfas no 123 in accordance with apb 25 compensation expense is recognized for stock awards that have intrinsic value on the date of grant unearned compensation is amortized and charged to income over the vesting schedule our employee option grants usually vest over a threeyear period from the date of issuance 

 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees based on estimated fair values in accordance with sfas 123r nonemployee members of the board of directors are treated as employees 

sfas 123r supersedes our previous accounting under apb 25 for periods beginning in fiscal 2006 in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” relating to sfas 123r we have applied the provisions of sab 107 in our adoption of sfas 123r 

 

we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january 1 2006 in accordance with the modified prospective transition method our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of sfas 123r 

 

income taxes 

 

income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years 

 

segment results 

 

as an electronic multidealer to client platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment pursuant to sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business 

 

stock repurchase program 

 

on october 26 2006 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 40 million of the our common stock we intend to repurchase the shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us shares repurchased under the program will be held in treasury for future use as of december 31 2006 we had repurchased 190500 shares at a purchase price of 27 million through march 9 2007 a total of 1475756 shares had been repurchased at a cost of 194 million

overview 

 

total revenues increased by 48 million or 61 to 833 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 786 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to increases in total commissions of 45 million investment income of 14 million and information and user access fees of 10 million offset in part by a decrease of 21 million in license fees 

 

total expenses increased by 77 million or 115 to 747 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 670 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to increases of 66 million in employee compensation and benefits 17 million in general and administrative expense 11 million in depreciation and amortization and 03 million in technology and communications these increases were offset by decreases in professional and consulting fees of 13 million and in marketing and advertising of 08 million excluding the impact of the incremental noncash sfas 123r stock option expense of 32 million total expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 45 million or 67 to 715 million from 670 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 income before taxes which includes the incremental noncash impact of sfas 123r stock option expense decreased by 30 million or 256 to 86 million compared to income before taxes of 116 million for the year ended december 31 2005 net income decreased by 27 million or 334 to 54 million compared to net income of 81 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

revenues 

 

our revenues and percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 and the resulting dollar and percentage changes are as follows 

 

 

 

commissions total commissions increased by 45 million or 67 to 714 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 669 million for 2005 the following table shows the extent to which the increase in commissions for the year ended december 31 2006 was attributable to transaction volumes fixed monthly distribution and dealeraxess ® minimum fees as well as the average level of variable transaction fees 

 

 

 

our average fees per million traded for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

 

the us highgrade average fee per million is calculated for each period presented using both the variable transaction fees and the fixed monthly fees paid by our brokerdealer clients 

 

the average us highgrade fee per million decreased due to the introduction in june 2005 of our new fee plan which has higher fixed monthly distribution fees and lower transaction fees resulting in lower average fees per million at higher trading volumes as well as the shorter maturity of trades executed on the platform this has been partially offset by the introduction of bond trading between brokerdealer clients through our dealeraxess ® product in june 2006 the fixed monthly us highgrade fixed distribution fees and the dealeraxess ® monthly minimum fees were 326 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 246 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

the decrease in the average european highgrade fee per million from 2005 to 2006 resulted from higher trading volumes in floatingrate notes which have lower fees per million the decrease in the average other fees per million resulted primarily from a change in the mix of business 

 

information and user access fees information and user access fees increased by 10 million or 235 to 55 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 44 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers to our corporate bondticker service from 2942 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 4629 for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

license fees license fees decreased by 21 million or 710 to 09 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 30 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this decrease was attributable to a decline in the amortization of previously received license fees we anticipate that license fees will be a less material source of revenues for us on a goingforward basis 

 

investment income investment income increased by 14 million or 454 to 46 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 32 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents and securities availableforsale balances and a rise in interest rates during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 

 

other other revenues decreased by 01 million or 105 to 09 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 11 million for the comparable period in 2005

employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 66 million or 187 to 421 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 354 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily attributable to incremental stock option compensation costs of 32 million due to 

the adoption of sfas 123r effective january 1 2006 higher salary expense of 20 million employee severance costs of 17 million and other stock compensation costs of 06 million offset by a reduction in employee benefits and payroll taxes of 05 million and lower incentive compensation costs of 04 million the total number of employees decreased to 176 as of december 31 2006 from 182 as of december 31 2005 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense increased to 505 for the year ended december 31 2006 from 451 for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 11 million or 191 to 67 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 56 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was attributable to increased amortization of capitalized software development costs for our credit default swap and dealeraxessproducts for the year ended december 31 2006 we capitalized 41 million of software development costs and 27 million of computer and related equipment purchases 

 

technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 03 million or 41 to 77 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 74 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was attributable to increased cost relating to the purchase of market data 

 

professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees decreased by 13 million or 137 to 81 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 94 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this decrease was primarily due to 09 million in recruiting fees and 08 million in information technology consulting costs 

 

marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense decreased by 08 million or 315 to 18 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 26 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in advertising expenditures of 07 million 

 

general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 17 million or 263 to 84 million for the year ended december 31 2006 from 66 million for the comparable period in 2005 this increase was primarily due to increases in franchise and sales taxes of 07 million occupancy costs of 06 million provision for bad debts of 02 million and 02 million in foreign currency translation losses 

 

provision for income tax 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded an income tax provision of 32 million the provision consists principally of 18 million in federal taxes 11 million in state and local taxes and 03 million in foreign taxes for the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded an income tax provision of 34 million the provision consists principally of 16 million in federal taxes 10 million in state and local taxes and 08 million in foreign taxes for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 with the exception of the payment of certain state and local taxes the provision for income taxes was a noncash expense since we had available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to offset the cash payment of taxes 

 

our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 was 370 and for the year ended december 31 2005 was 296 the 2005 tax provision included a 29 million reduction in our valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on among other factors the geographic and business mix of our earnings 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of 1016 million we have recorded a valuation allowance of 148 million against the gross deferred tax assets of 566 million arising from the net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

 

overview 

 

total revenues increased by 28 million or 36 to 786 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 758 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 23 million and information and user access fees of 17 million offset in part by a decrease of 13 million in total commissions 

 

total expenses increased by 85 million or 146 to 670 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 585 million for the comparable period in 2004 this increase was primarily due to increases of 44 million in professional and consulting fees 24 million in general and administrative expense 23 million in employee compensation and benefits 20 million in technology and communications and 11 million in depreciation and amortization expense offset by decreases in warrantrelated expense and moneyline revenue share in each case compared to the comparable period in 2004 

 

income before taxes decreased by 58 million to 116 million compared to income before taxes of 173 million for the year ended december 31 2004 net income decreased by 494 million to 81 million compared to net income of 576 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this decrease was primarily due to a net income tax benefit of 403 million that was recorded for the year ended december 31 2004 due to the reduction of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

 

during the year ended december 31 2005 we reduced the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets by 29 million to 152 million based on management’s assessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded in addition we adjusted the income tax rate used for recording the deferred tax assets resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense of 18 million without giving effect to the adjustment to the income tax rate used for recognizing the deferred tax assets and the reduction in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets our net income for the year ended december 31 2005 would have been 70 million

other factors influencing liquidity and capital resources 

 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients nine of which are also our stockholders who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform the loss of or a significant reduction in the use of our electronic platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce our cash flows affect our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

 

we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer in the us and marketaxess europe limited is a registered alternative trading system in the uk as such they are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity based on certain minimum capital requirements the us and the uk regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying borrowings from its parent or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification to or approval from its principal regulator the capital structures of our subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements as of december 31 2006 marketaxess corporation had net capital of 150 million which was 140 million in excess of its required minimum net capital of 10 million marketaxess europe limited had financial resources as defined by the fsa of 149 million which was 105 million in excess of its required financial resources of 44 million 

 

in june 2006 our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation commenced operating an anonymous matching service for its brokerdealer clients marketaxess corporation executes trades on a riskless principal basis which are cleared and settled by an independent clearing broker the securities clearing agreement that marketaxess corporation maintains with the independent clearing broker commenced in december 2004 under the securities clearing agreement marketaxess corporation maintains a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash or us government securities as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 the collateral deposit included in securities and cash provided as collateral on the consolidated statements of financial condition was 05 million marketaxess corporation is exposed to credit risk in the event a contraparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreement between marketaxess corporation and the independent clearing broker the clearing broker has the right to charge marketaxess corporation for losses resulting from a counterparty’s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations the losses are not capped at a maximum amount and apply to all trades executed through the clearing broker at december 31 2006 marketaxess corporation recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to this right in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications 

our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

 

effects of inflation 

 

because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

 

market risk 

 

the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had a 490 million investment in securities availableforsale adverse movements such as a 10 decrease in the securities underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss in addition principal gains and losses resulting from theses positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect positive or negative on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 

 

see item 1a  risk factors  “risks related to our industry — economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer ” 

 

interest rate risk 

 

interest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to the money market instruments us treasury obligations and shortterm fixedincome securities in which we invest as of december 31 2006 we invested in primarily federal agency issues and municipal securities of 490 million we do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform 

 

derivative risk 

 

our limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market we use this market to mitigate our us dollar versus pound sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our uk subsidiaries as of december 31 2006 the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts was 174 million we do not speculate in any derivative instruments 

 

credit risk 

 

in june 2006 we began executing riskless principal transactions between our brokerdealer clients through our subsidiary marketaxess corporation we act as an intermediary in these transactions by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching backtoback trades which are then settled through a thirdparty clearing organization settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in our role as trading counterparty to our brokerdealer clients executing trades on the dealeraxess ® platform we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us the policies and procedures we use to manage this credit risk are new and untested there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk

 item 1 business tableend   marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities our electronic trading platform is accessed by our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients either via a direct connection or over the internet our 657 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2005 and december 2005 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 25 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform we also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties since our inception the majority of our revenues have been generated from the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds although an increasing percentage of our revenues has recently been derived from the trading of european highgrade corporate and emerging markets bonds from our data and analytical tools and from interest income our trading commissions are generated from transactions between a brokerdealer client and an institutional investor client 

  our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds new issues and credit default swap indices to date however crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds new issues and credit default swap indices do not represent a significant component of our revenues 

  we derive our revenues primarily from commissions paid by our brokerdealer clients for trades executed on our platform which represented 852 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 and to a lesser extent from information and user access fees charged to our clients which represented 56 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 interest income earned on our cash cash equivalent and securities balance which represented 40 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 and license fees for access to our trading platform charged to certain of our brokerdealer clients which represented 38 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 

  traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process which is still how most corporate bonds 

1   are traded has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues in recent years an increasing number of corporate bond trading participants have utilized email and other electronic means of communication including proprietary singledealer systems for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

  through our electronic platform our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadto treasury data search capabilities and independent credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 19 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

  we are not a party to the actual trades that occur on our platform and we do not at any time take title to the traded securities or the proceeds from the sale of such securities rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other 

  our client base includes 25 of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and 657 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2005 and december 2005 including 80 of the top 100 global holders of us corporate bonds as measured by thomson financial our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 97 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and in excess of 60 of the underwriting of newly issued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2005 and include 16 of the top 20 brokerdealers as ranked by 2005 new issue underwriting volume of european highgrade corporate bonds we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the other markets in which we operate secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by traditional means including telephone email and proprietary singledealer systems in addition to our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future we believe that these traditional means of trading remain the manner in which the majority of bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented 76 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2005 as reported by the national association of securities dealers inc “nasd” trade reporting and compliance engine “trace” which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to either the total volume of clientto dealer trading or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

2   

   we experienced significant growth in total trading volume total commissions and income before taxes from 2003 to 2004 however total trading volume and total commissions remained relatively constant from 2004 to 2005 and income before taxes declined as a result of higher expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004 as illustrated in the following table 

   for the year ended december 31 2005 594 of our trading volume was in us highgrade corporate bonds 245 of our trading volume was in european highgrade corporate bonds and 161 of our trading volume was in other bonds most of which are emerging markets bonds 

industry background 

  fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return as of december 31 2005 there were approximately 253 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding in the us market including 50 trillion of us corporate bonds we are primarily active in seven segments of the global fixedincome securities market us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds new issues and credit default swap indices 

   the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 30 trillion as of december 31 1999 to 50 trillion as of december 31 2005 the average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds increased from approximately 190 billion in 2002 the first calendar year for which such data are available to approximately 210 billion at the end of 2005 

  the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

  the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has undergone significant change over the last several years which has been driven by a number of factors including 

 3   

 

   the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe 

  we believe that the european highgrade corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors are unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market 

 

   we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar or eurodenominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

  the institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds has recently expanded to include many crossover investors from the more mainstream highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential as well as by a general trend toward positive economic and political reforms and improving economic performance in many emerging markets countries 

   we define the highyield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service we define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment grade by one agency but investment grade by the other the total amount of highyield corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 875 billion as of december 31 2003 to approximately 10 trillion as of december 31 2005 

4     the nasd began publicly disseminating realtime price information on approximately 12000 highyield corporate bond issues in 2005 trades in bonds rated bb and lower are subject to immediate dissemination if the trade size is less than 1 million or greater than 1 million and trades an average of once or more a day the disseminated set was expanded on february 1 2005 to include reporting of certain transactions on a delayed basis the average daily trading volume of highyield bonds reported by the nasd for the year ended december 31 2005 was 526 billion 

  we believe that the average daily trading volume in the highyield corporate bond market has grown during 2005 partly as the result of downgrades of some large corporate bond issuers including ford and general motors 

   we define the agency bond market to include debt issued by a us governmentsponsored agency the offerings of these agencies are backed by but not guaranteed by the us government some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the student loan marketing association “sallie mae” federal national mortgage association “fannie mae” and federal home loan mortgage corporation “freddie mac” the total amount of long term debt issued by us federal agencies declined from 12 trillion in 2003 to 670 billion in 2005 

  the federal reserve bank of new york reported average daily trading volume in federal agency coupon securities for 2005 of 171 billion 

   the new issues market for fixedincome securities also referred to as the primary market refers to that part of the capital markets that deals with the issuance of new securities a process whereby companies governments or public sector institutions obtain funding through the sale of a new bond issue the new issuance process typically involves a syndicate of securities dealers who purchase the newlyissued bonds from the issuer after arranging for placement of the bonds with institutional and other investors 

  total debt outstanding in the us bond markets as of december 31 2005 was 253 trillion with corporate bonds accounting for 198 or 50 trillion of the total total bond issuance in the us bond markets in 2005 reached 55 trillion a 05 increase from 2004 

  corporate bond issuance decreased to 7017 billion in 2005 compared to 7279 billion in 2004 and 7627 billion in 2003 in 2005 investmentgrade debt accounted for 89 of the corporate bond issuance with the highyield sector accounting for 11 of the issuance 

  the level of corporate bond issuance is dependant on a number of factors including the funding needs of issuers investor demand for corporate bonds and the level of interest rates 

   credit default swaps are contracts that transfer an asset’s risk and return from one party to another without transferring ownership of the underlying asset allowing market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixedincome securities and other debt obligations they are often designed to hedge other exposures and can be tied to particular events such as a default bankruptcy or ratings downgrade credit default swaps provide increased flexibility and liquidity for investors and lenders to diversify their credit risk the appeal of these products is apparent in the growth in the total notional amount of outstanding credit default swaps which increased from approximately 900 billion at december 31 2001 to approximately 124 trillion at june 30 2005 

5   our competitive strengths 

  our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

   we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

   our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 25 of the leading global securities brokerdealers and 657 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2005 and december 2005 we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients which includes 80 of the top 100 global holders of us corporate bonds as measured by thomson financial we believe that if we continue to grow the participation of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform the benefits in liquidity on the platform to both brokerdealers and institutional investors will be amplified further motivating them to use our platform currently the majority of trading of us highgrade corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading methods implying significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our trading volume our trading volume across all of our products increased from 1922 billion in 2003 to 2981 billion in 2004 and to 2992 billion in 2005 our volume in us highgrade corporate bonds represented 76 of the total us highgrade corporate bond volume excluding convertible bonds for 2005 as reported by nasd trace which includes interdealer and retail trading as well as trading between institutional investors and brokerdealers we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to either the total volume of clientto dealer trading or the size of the other markets we serve and therefore we are unable to accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

 

   we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

  competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadto treasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 75000 

  transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 130 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in 

6   inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadto treasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the investor 

  improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

   we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional fixedincome trading methods including 

  greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

  more efficient inventory management for brokerdealers the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

   we offer additional benefits over traditional fixedincome trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

  greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from information being manually entered into different systems 

  efficient risk monitoring and compliance institutional investors and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixed income trades our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadto treasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform these data also represent a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

   in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including 

7     information services the information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions our corporate bondticker provides access to realtime and historical price yield and marketaxess estimated spreadto treasuries for publicly disseminated nasd traceeligible bonds corporate bondticker combines publiclyavailable trace data with the prices for trades executed on our us highgrade electronic trading platform integrating the two data sources and providing realtime trace data with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available in addition corporate bondticker provides indicative prices for secondary loans and credit default swaps through arrangements with certain of our brokerdealer clients and independent credit research our electronic trading platform allows institutional investors to compile sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual information gathering process or other electronic services 

  straightthrough processing straightthrough processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from endto end — trade execution confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention our electronic trading platform provides brokerdealers and institutional investors with the ability to automate portions of their transaction processing requirements improving accuracy and efficiency through electronic messaging institutional investors can submit inquiries to and receive electronic notices of execution from marketaxess in industry standard protocols complete with all relevant trade details institutional investors can download trade messages allocate trades to subaccounts on whose behalf the trades were made and send the allocations to brokerdealers for confirmation 

   we have developed proprietary technology that is highly secure faulttolerant and provides adequate capacity for our current operations as well as for substantial growth our highly scalable systems are designed to accommodate additional volume products and clients with relatively little modification and low incremental costs 

   since our inception we have been an innovator in the fixedincome securities markets our management team is comprised of executives with an average of more than 20 years’ experience in the securities industry we have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of fixedincome trading including the existing relationships between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional trading methods euromoney magazine recognized marketaxess as offering the best multidealer trading platform for corporate bonds in 2003 and 2004 

  some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include 

 our strategy 

  our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

8   

   we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client fixedincome platform our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to make our current product offerings on our european electronic trading platform available to our 432 active us institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2005 and december 2005 and to increase the number of active european institutional investor clients 225 firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january and december 2005 using our us electronic trading platform in each case subject to regulatory requirements 

   we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities market due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter into new markets with relatively little technology modification and incremental cost 

   we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is more fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we also plan to continue to add functionality to enhance the ability of our clients to achieve a fully automated endto end straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we are continually considering the introduction of new trading techniques as an example we have the technology necessary to offer anonymous trading of fixedincome securities if and when the market opportunity for such a product arises 

   we regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondticker in order to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients examples of added content include pricing for syndicated loans and credit derivatives and independent credit research we intend to enter into distribution agreements with information and data services companies in order to widen the user base of our data products and to continue adding new content and analytical capabilities in july 2005 we entered into an agreement with interactive data corporation through its subsidiary ft interactive data to promote and market corporate bondticker we expect this and other distribution partnerships to broaden our presence in the marketplace and increase our brand awareness we intend to seek out additional market leaders in various segments of the securities industry and leverage their existing customer bases and distribution channels to further our data services market penetration 

  as the use of our electronic trading platform continues to grow we believe that the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will also increase further enhancing the value of our information services offerings to our clients 

   we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients 

  in december 2005 we announced an arrangement with bloomberg lp “bloomberg” to establish a direct interface between the marketaxess electronic credit trading platform and the bloomberg portfolio order management system “poms” on the bloomberg professionalr service the interface between the 

9   company and bloomberg allows marketaxess users of bloomberg poms to send trade inquiries from their poms fixedincome blotter directly into the marketaxess trading platform upon execution of a trade marketaxess will then transmit the filled orders back to bloomberg poms this new workflow eliminates several manual rekeying steps in the trade processing cycle enhancing straightthrough processing for marketaxess clients who are also users of bloomberg poms 

   we plan to continue to actively market our trading platform to hedge funds we are investing in products that suit the needs of this client segment and we have reconfigured our sales teams to improve our service to hedge funds we believe that the launch of credit default swap index trading on our platform will enable us to increase volumes from our hedge fund clients as this client segment is an active user of credit default swaps

   we currently have nine directors eight of whom are not our employees of the eight nonemployee directors two are employees of entities that are affiliates of brokerdealer clients and stockholders of marketaxess although these entities do not have the contractual right to designate members of our board of directors 

15   

   our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by means other than our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including telephone conversations email messaging and other electronic means of communication including proprietary singledealer systems 

  we cannot be assured that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors other companies including some in which certain of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

   as of december 31 2005 nine of our brokerdealer clients abn amro bnp paribas banc of america bear stearns credit suisse deutsche bank jpmorgan lehman brothers and ubs or their affiliates were stockholders of ours as of december 31 2005 these nine brokerdealer clients owned 17860982 shares of our common stock our nonvoting common stock and shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants including approximately 387 of our outstanding common stock to the extent that some or all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote similarly they are likely to be able to influence decisions requiring approval by our stockholders

competition 

  the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 

 16   

   competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

  in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

   we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown over the past three years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

  our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

  our brokerdealer clients have invested in building application programming interfaces with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

  furthermore a number of our institutional investors clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order portfolio management and accounting systems we believe that this increases the commitment of these institutional investor clients to our services 

17     many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

  any combination of our competitors or our current brokerdealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future are potential competitors of ours 

technology 

  the design and quality of our technology are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies 

  all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in case the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated highspeed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

  we have designed our application with an easyto use windowsbased interface through a secure single signon our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform we provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention 

  in february 2005 we completed the transition to new internallydeveloped software that integrated our emerging markets and european bond platforms with our us highgrade corporate bond platform the new trading platforms incorporate the feedback we received from our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients the new platforms offer enhanced functionality and greater easeof use additionally they consolidate separate trading protocols and systems thereby reducing the ongoing development and maintenance costs associated with maintaining multiple technology platforms the new platforms have been designed to handle six times our current trading volume

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients 

who are also our stockholders 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients nine of which were also our stockholders as of december 31 2005 who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

  we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries although each brokerdealer client is currently a party to an agreement with us the obligations of each brokerdealer under these agreements are minimal none of these agreements is exclusive and brokerdealers may terminate such agreements andor enter into and in some cases have entered into similar agreements with our competitors for example some of our brokerdealer clients are also clients of thompson tradeweb a multidealer to institutional investor trading platform that operates an online corporate bond trading platform 

  our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including telephone conversations email messaging and other electronic means of communication currently the preponderance of trading of us highgrade corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading methods most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are 

20   involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as equity holders and such ventures or newly created ventures may compete with us and our electronic trading platform now and in the future 

  some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading networks these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us including either individually or collectively organizing or investing in a separate company similar to us for the purpose of competing with us or pursuing corporate opportunities that might be attractive to us accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

  any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

  we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions from the nine brokerdealer clients that were our stockholders as of december 31 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 366 million or 547 of our commissions for the year ended december 31 2004 393 million or 577 of our commissions and for the year ended december 31 2003 330 million or 625 of our commissions were generated by these nine brokerdealer clients none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform reduced involvement of these brokerdealer clients due to their loss of a right to designate a member of our board of directors or the potential reduction in the level of their equity ownership if these entities should sell shares of our common stock may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the loss of or a significant reduction of participation on our platform by these brokerdealer clients may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

several of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that differ from those of our other stockholders 

  as of december 31 2005 nine of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates owned in the aggregate a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that are different from ours and those of our other stockholders for example in their capacity as brokerdealer clients they would presumably favor lower commissions andor commission caps furthermore as stockholders in other consortia that have developed competitive electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of competitive electronic trading networks they may decide to direct some or all of their electronic trading business to one or more of our competitors while these actions if taken would presumably reduce our revenues and our market capitalization and therefore the value of their ownership position in us there can be no assurance that they will not decide to take such actions for their own strategic reasons 

  we are not a party to any voting agreement with any of our stockholders and are not aware of any voting agreements among our brokerdealer clients however they may enter into a voting agreement in the future or otherwise vote in a similar manner to the extent that all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote 

21   similarly they will be able to determine decisions requiring approval by our stockholders as a result they or their affiliates may be able to 

   as a result of these factors we may be less likely to pursue relationships with strategic partners who are not stockholders of ours which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position furthermore these factors could also limit stockholder value by preventing a change in control or sale of marketaxess 

future sales of shares by our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly andor limit our ability to utilize certain income tax benefits 

  subject to compliance with the federal securities laws all of the shares of common stock and nonvoting common stock owned by our brokerdealer clients are eligible for resale in the public market subject in the case of “affiliates” of marketaxess to volume limitations on resale 

  in addition to the extent any future sales of common stock by our brokerdealer clients result in an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code “section 382” we may not be able to realize certain income tax benefits resulting from our net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of such ownership change an ownership change as defined in section 382 occurs when there is a 50 or greater change in a company’s stock ownership over a rolling threeyear period for more information regarding these potential income tax benefits and our net operating loss carryforwards see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — revenues and expenses — income taxes” 

risks related to our business 

we face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 

  the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

   many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing 

22   and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

  any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we have experienced losses and may incur losses in the future 

  our losses were 168 million from the period of inception through december 31 2000 651 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 361 million for the year ended december 31 2002 for the year ended december 31 2003 we reported net income of 42 million for the year ended december 31 2004 we reported net income of 576 million which included 461 million in income which was recognized upon our reassessment of the likelihood of realization of a portion of our deferred tax assets and for the year ended december 31 2005 we reported net income of 81 million we expect that our expenses will increase in the near term as we continue to expand our business and in order to meet the requirements related to being a public company we cannot predict whether we will be able to sustain profitability and we may incur losses in future periods if we are not able to sustain profitability our stock price may decline 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor our historical growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

  the use of our electronic trading platform is relatively new the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

  our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive a majority of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our trading volume for us highgrade corporate bonds has remained relatively constant since 2004 and our commissions from such trading have also remained relatively constant for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability 

  our plans to pursue other opportunities for revenue growth are at an early stage and we cannot assure you that our plans will be successful or that we will actually proceed with them as described 

because we have a limited operating history it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

  marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our electronic trading platform began in october 2000 with the commercial launch of the platform in january 2001 as a result we have only a limited operating history from which you can evaluate our business and our prospects we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by earlystage companies in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

 23   

   if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform could harm our business and profitability 

  we have experienced decreases in overall trading volume in certain periods and may experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

  likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers may be less likely to post prices electronically 

  a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because our commissions are largely variable but a significant portion of our costs is fixed 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

  due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 

  our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to other factors including 

 24   

   as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

  our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

  our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

  we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

   developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform 

25   information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outof date or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

  further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

  we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or a deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

  we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

  in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow 

26   delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

  we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

   in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

   any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

27     in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

  we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

  our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause brokerdealers and clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform this could adversely affect our ability to compete 

  intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have filed 24 patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can make no assurances that any such patents will be issued or if issued will protect our business and processes from competition additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

  we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

28   defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

  in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

   we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to enter into additional marketing and strategic alliances or if our current strategic alliances are not successful we may not maintain the current level of trading or generate increased trading on our trading platform 

  from time to time we may enter into strategic alliances that will enable us to enter new markets provide products or services that we do not currently offer or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients 

  entering into joint ventures and alliances entails risks including 

   we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into new strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us or at all these arrangements if entered into may not generate the expected number of new clients or increased trading volume we are seeking unsuccessful joint ventures or alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

29   if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

  if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

   these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outof pocket costs 

  the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

  our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey our president chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

30   because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

  we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

  the market for qualified personnel has grown more competitive in recent periods as electronic commerce has experienced growth domestic and international labor markets have tightened in concert with the continuing recovery in general economic conditions many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees the implementation of sfas 123r relating to the expensing of share based compensation may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates may require to join our company 

  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

  the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the sec and the nasd as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

  most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

   we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in the nasd and registration as a brokerdealer 

  we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited are subject to us and uk regulations as a registered brokerdealer and as an alternative trading system respectively which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the company or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to the company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator 

31     changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

  our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats or a decision by us to reactivate our anonymous trading platform which is regulated as an alternative trading system would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material 

  as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealer competitors we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors in november 2000 we received a civil investigative demand from the us department of justice in connection with the antitrust division’s investigation of electronic bond and other consortia trading systems after compliance with all information requests we received notice from the us department of justice in 2004 that the investigation was officially closed as the use of our electronic trading platform grows and represents a greater share of the trading volume of fixedincome securities the risk that other regulatory investigations could commence in the future increases additionally the involvement of individuals affiliated with certain of our brokerdealer clients on our board of directors and as stockholders may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

  the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

  we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the united states these risks include 

 32   

   our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

  our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements historically we have satisfied these needs primarily through equity financing from certain of our brokerdealer clients our acquisition of trading edge inc internally generated funds and most recently our initial public offering although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

   we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all our existing investors including our brokerdealer clients and their affiliates have no obligation to make further investments in us and we do not anticipate that they will do so if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

  as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may place undue strain on our systems and resources the securities exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors additionally we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage nasdaq rules also require that a majority of our board of directors and all of certain subcommittees of the board of directors consist of 

33   independent directors we cannot assure you that our board of directors will continue to include a majority of independent directors to comply with the requirements of these rules 

compliance with changing laws and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure has resulted and will continue to result in the incurrence of additional expenses associated with being a public company 

  new and changing laws and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 impose stricter corporate governance requirements and greater disclosure obligations they have had the effect of increasing the complexity and cost of our corporate governance compliance diverting the time and attention of our management from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities and increasing the risk of personal liability for our board members and executive officers involved in our corporate governance process our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations has resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and increased professional fees in addition it may become more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance these laws and regulations may impose obligations that will increase the legal and financial costs required to consummate a business combination and increase the time required to complete a transaction furthermore in order to meet the new corporate governance and disclosure obligations we have been taking and will continue to take steps to improve our controls and procedures and related corporate governance policies and procedures to address compliance issues and correct any deficiencies that we may discover 

  while we believe that the procedures and policies that we have in place are effective to address the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other regulatory requirements the expansion of our operations and the growth of our business may require us to modify and expand our disclosure controls and procedures and related corporate governance policies any unanticipated difficulties in preparing for and implementing these and other corporate governance and reporting reforms could result in material delays in compliance or significantly increase our costs also there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully comply with these new laws and regulations if we fail to prepare for and implement the reforms required by these new laws and regulations on a timely basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted our reputation may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

  many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our industry 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not continue to increase we will not be able to achieve our business objectives 

  the success of our business plan depends on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

34   economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

  the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

   any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets

executive summary 

  marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities through our platform 657 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2005 and december 2005 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 25 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform our active institutional investor clients include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds we also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us and european highgrade corporate bonds 

  our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds including both highgrade and noninvestment grade debt we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and highyield bonds agency bonds new issues and credit default swap indices 

  the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and user access fees license fees and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

  based on our limited operating history we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

   we operate in a highly competitive business environment in particular we compete with bond trading business conducted over the telephone between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients institutional investors have historically purchased fixedincome securities by contacting bond sales professionals at one or more brokerdealers by telephone or email and inquiring about the price and availability of individual bonds this remains the manner in which the majority of corporate bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers in addition there are numerous other electronic trading platforms 

41   currently in existence these include thomson tradeweb a multidealer to institutional investor trading platform and bloomberg which provides electronic trading functionality 

  we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of several factors including the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform the quality and speed of execution total transaction costs technological capabilities including the ease of use of our trading platform and the range of our products and services we also believe that we are well positioned to respond to future challenges due to the experience and continuity of our senior management team 

  we seek to grow and diversify our revenues by capitalizing on our status as the operator of a leading platform for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities the key elements of our strategy are 

 history 

  marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our fully disclosed multidealer platform began in october 2000 we launched trading on our electronic platform in january 2001 with eight brokerdealer clients since that time our brokerdealer clients have grown to include 25 of the leading securities firms our brokerdealer clients currently are abn amro banc of america securities barclays bear stearns bnp paribas citigroup credit suisse deutsche bank dresdner bank ag dz bank ag first tennessee national goldman sachs hsbc ing financial markets jeffries  company jpmorgan lehman brothers merrill lynch morgan stanley royal bank of canada the royal bank of scotland santander investment securities société générale ubs and wachovia 

  in march 2001 we acquired trading edge inc “trading edge” the operator of an anonymous trading platform for us corporate bonds convertible bonds municipal bonds and emerging markets bonds 

  in 2001 we decided to terminate the anonymous convertible and municipal bond trading platforms and currently offer us corporate bond and emerging markets bond trading on a fully disclosed basis only however the technology platform developed by trading edge and obtained by us through the acquisition is now the core of our product offerings 

  in august 2001 one of our uk subsidiaries marketaxess europe limited began operations with secondary electronic trading in us dollardenominated and eurodenominated corporate bonds 

  in february 2002 we reorganized into marketaxess holdings inc a holding company that operates primarily through two operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation is registered as a brokerdealerand marketaxess europe limited is regulated as an alternative trading system with applicable market regulators in the us and the uk respectively in may 

42   2003 we incorporated a canadian subsidiary marketaxess canada limited which has applied for registration under the securities act in ontario and is in the process of seeking approval for membership with the investment dealers association of canada 

  we launched our information service corporate bondticker in july 2002 corporate bondticker combines nasd trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide trading professionals research firms rating and news agencies and other market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond information 

  we have been funded by nine of our 25 brokerdealer clients through purchases of equity securities primarily convertible preferred stock for a total purchase price of 798 million in addition we acquired cash and investments at fair value totaling 364 million in connection with the acquisition of trading edge we also received net proceeds of 539 million from the sale of shares of our common stock in our november 2004 initial public offering as of december 31 2005 we had cash and cash equivalents and securitiesavailableforsale totaling 1181 million we have no debt outstanding 

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

   the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

   any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced trading activity in the fixedincome securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global fixedincome securities markets 

   the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

 43   

   competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that compete or will compete with us 

  in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

   we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the past three years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

  our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

  many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have a substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wide range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

  any combination of our competitors or our current brokerdealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future are potential competitors of ours 

   our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

  our us subsidiary marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer with the sec and is a member of the nasd our uk subsidiary marketaxess europe limited is registered as an alternative trading system dealer with the fsa in the uk both us and uk regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator 

44     the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

   we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 trends in our business 

  the following table identifies changes in key financial measures of our business for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

 45      the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions in us and european highgrade corporate bonds executed on our platform most transactions executed on our platform are originated by our active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2005 and december 2005 consisting of 657 institutions as of december 31 2005 the volume of transactions executed across our platform is largely determined by the number of transaction inquiries originated by our institutional investor clients and the competitiveness of the prices they receive from our brokerdealer clients in response to these inquiries 

  the notional value of bonds traded over our platform has grown rapidly since the commercial launch of the platform in january 2001 to 2981 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 but has remained relatively constant from 2004 to 2005 with volume for the year ended december 31 2005 totaling 2992 billion 

  our overall trading volume is impacted by volume in the corporate bond market generally various factors that have historically impacted overall corporate bond market trading volume include the absolute level of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of us highgrade corporate bonds volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities economic conditions the geopolitical environment market psychology relative prices of competing asset classes and more importantly changes in expectations about inflation if interest rates continue to rise it is possible that our trading volumes will continue to be adversely impacted because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on our future profitability we believe that overall us and european highgrade corporate bond trading volumes declined between 2004 and 2005 based on nasd trace data volume in the 100000 to 5 million range a trade size category where nasd trace data reports the actual volume numbers fell by 12 between 2004 and 2005 

  we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients nine of which were also stockholders as of december 31 2005 who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or third party platforms with institutional investors our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type and the maturity of the bond traded commission revenues grew from 528 million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 682 million for the year ended december 31 2004 but declined to 669 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

  we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of bonds traded on our platform and the amount of commissions earned by us 

 46   

   growth in the notional value of trades executed over our platform has been driven by an increase in the base of institutional investor clients our active institutional investor client base clients that executed trades through our electronic trading platform in the preceding year has increased from 432 as of december 31 2003 to 539 as of december 31 2004 and to 657 as of december 31 2005 however as the number of institutional investor clients has increased our volumes have been and will in the future be increasingly driven not only by new clients but also by existing clients executing a larger portion of their trading activity through our platform we believe that our ability to continue to deliver enhanced functionality and to provide reliable realtime access to our platform will be important factors in increasing usage of the platform by existing clients 

  our brokerdealer client base has also increased from 18 as of december 31 2003 to 22 as of december 31 2004 and to 25 as of december 31 2005 we believe that these brokerdealer clients represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate historical growth in the number of our brokerdealer clients is not necessarily indicative of future growth although it is likely that the majority of our future growth will be derived from additional trading by existing brokerdealer clients rather than from the addition of new brokerdealer clients 

  we commenced commercial operations in january 2001 with the launch of our us highgrade corporate bond platform we expanded the markets we serve to emerging markets bonds and highyield bonds in march 2001 and to european highgrade corporate bonds in september 2001 in 2005 we introduced trading in agency bonds and in credit default swap indices in the future we expect to leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new segments of the fixedincome securities market 

  as the notional value of bonds traded over our platform has grown we have also been more dependent on the overall level of activity in the markets in which we operate while we believe that trading activity in the fixedincome markets in which we operate has generally increased since our inception there have been periods including the year ended december 31 2005 in which such trading activity was flat or actually declined we have also experienced fluctuations in trading volumes between quarters as a result of general economic conditions as well as factors specific to the fixedincome markets in which we operate these quarterly fluctuations have in the past created and may in the future create some variability in our revenues 

  our average commission on trades executed over our platform excluding singledealer inquiries has declined from 275 per million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 229 per million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2005 under the fee plans currently in place for secondary us highgrade corporate bond trading and european highgrade corporate bond trading the average fees per million will decline as trading volumes increase we also anticipate that some reduction in average fees per million for other products may occur in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

   in addition to the commissions discussed above we have also earned revenue from certain fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients and income earned on investments 

  institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our us highgrade corporate bond platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 

47     we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker to our brokerdealer clients institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers corporate bondticker combines nasd trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide a comprehensive set of corporate bond information the information services fee is a flat monthly fee based on the level of service we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and dataonly subscribers 

  brokerdealer clients other than those that previously made equity investments in the company pay an initial license fee which is typically due and payable upon execution of the brokerdealer agreement the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial setup costs incurred to enable a brokerdealer to begin using the company’s electronic trading platform 

  revenues from these sources totaled 57 million for the year ended december 31 2003 76 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 116 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we anticipate that revenues other than commissions will grow as we expand our data and information services offerings 

   our total expenses were 541 million for the year ended december 31 2003 585 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 670 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

  in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

   we anticipate expense growth in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits as a result of increases in the number of staff as we introduce new products however we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure in addition beginning in the 2006 fiscal year we are required pursuant to sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which became effective on january 1 2006 to record compensation expense based on the fair value of stock and options issued to employees previously we were only required to record compensation expense to the extent that the fair value of our common stock exceeded the exercise price of the options on the measurement date 

  as a public company we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which requires us to incur significant expenditures to comply with these requirements 

48   revenues and expenses 

   we derive our revenues from commissions for trades executed over our platform information and user access fees license fees interest income and other income a table detailing the amount and percentage of revenue generated from each of these sources is provided below 

   the following table shows the extent to which the changes in revenue for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 were attributable to increases and decreases in volumes average level of commissions charged information services license fees interest income and other factors 

   a table detailing the amount of revenues generated by the nine brokerdealer clients that were also stockholders as of december 31 2005 abn amro banc of america securities bear stearns bnp paribas credit suisse deutsche bank jpmorgan lehman brothers and ubs and their respective affiliates as well 

49   as the corresponding percentage of total revenues is provided below for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

   we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients that are also our stockholders commissions from these brokerdealer stockholders have decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to increased volume from existing brokerdealer clients that are not stockholders as well as the addition of new brokerdealer clients that are not stockholders potential reduction in the level of their equity ownership if these brokerdealer shareholders sell shares of our common stock in the future may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients and result in a reduction in our revenues and net income 

  our current fee plans may result in a reduction in average fees as trading volume increases we may also introduce new plans that could result in lower fees particularly where we believe that fee reductions will be offset by higher trading volumes historical trading volume and revenue are not necessarily indicative of future trading volume and revenue 

   while the vast majority of our commissions are generated from transactions between a brokerdealer client and an institutional investor client we have generated a de minimis amount of our commissions from transactions between two brokerdealer clients commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type and the maturity of the bond traded the commission rates are generally set at levels that are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone and the trading volume executed through our platform by the brokerdealer completing the trade under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

50     overall trading volumes and the average fee per million traded for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 are detailed in the table below 

   for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the day the transactions were executed 

  singledealer inquiries represent us highgrade trades for which no fees were charged in accordance with the new us highgrade fee plan that went into effect on june 1 2005 

   prior to august 2003 all of our brokerdealer clients operated under a standard transaction fee plan for the secondary trading of us highgrade corporate bonds under the standard transaction fee plan commissions were calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of the bonds traded on our platform varied based on the type and maturity of the bond and were generally higher on bonds with longer maturities under this plan there was no fixed monthly fee and no cap on the aggregate amount of commissions payable by a brokerdealer client 

  our standard fee schedule for us highgrade corporate bonds was revised in august 2003 to provide lower average transaction commissions for dealers that transacted higher us highgrade volumes through our platform while at the same time providing us with an element of fixed commissions over the twoyear term of the plans one of the revised plans that was well suited for our most active brokerdealer clients included a fee cap that limited the potential growth in us highgrade revenue the fee caps were set to take effect at volume levels significantly above those being transacted at the time the revised transaction fee plans were introduced most of our brokerdealer clients entered into fee arrangements with respect to the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds that included both a fixed component and a variable component these agreements had been scheduled to expire during the third quarter of 2005 

51     on june 1 2005 we introduced a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in us highgrade corporate bonds executed on our electronic trading platform as of december 31 2005 17 of our us highgrade brokerdealer clients have signed new twoyear agreements that supersede the fee arrangements that we entered into with many of our brokerdealer clients during the third quarter of 2003 the new plan incorporates higher fixed monthly fees and lower variable fees for our brokerdealer clients than the previous us highgrade transaction fee plans described above and incorporates volume incentives to our brokerdealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform under the new fee plan we electronically add the variable fee to the spread quoted by the brokerdealer client but do not charge for inquiries that an institutional investor client sends to a single brokerdealer client the variable fee varies depending on the size of the trade as well as the maturity and yield of the bond traded the combination of higher fixed and lower variable fees in the new plan results in higher revenue to us at lower volume levels but will limit revenue growth in the future for us highgrade corporate bond trading as volume levels increase 

  the average commission on us highgrade transactions declined for the year ended december 31 2003 from 287 to 248 per million traded for the year ended december 31 2004 but increased to 268 per million traded for the year ended december 31 2005 following the introduction of the latest fee plan in june 2005

   brokerdealer clients pay a commission for transactions in emerging markets bonds based on the type and amount of the security traded the commission is calculated on a standard schedule that applies to all brokerdealer clients and varies depending on whether the transaction is in an actively traded sovereign issue a less actively traded sovereign issue or a corporate issue a lower commission rate is charged for actively traded sovereign issues while a higher commission rate is charged for corporate issues the average commission on emerging markets transactions for the year ended december 31 2004 was 205 per million traded and for the year ended december 31 2005 was 188 per million traded

  shares allocated under the warrant program were expensed each quarter at fair market value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” “sfas no 123” we determined the fair market value of the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant using the blackscholes optionpricing model the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march 1 2004 accordingly we will no longer record any expense related to this warrant

   income taxes are accounted for on the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets arise as a result of our net operating losses and from the tax effect of various types of temporary differences including in our case differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and for financial statement purposes 

  as of december 31 2005 we had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of 1041 million the us net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2005 totaling 935 million will begin to expire in 2018 and the uk net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2005 totaling 106 million do not expire in 2000 and in 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation respectively had an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 as a result of section 382 and pertinent tax provisions the utilization of 342 million and 392 million on a tax basis and book basis respectively of our net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the ownership change is subject to significant limitations in addition our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to additional annual limitations if there is a 50 or greater change in our ownership as determined over a rolling threeyear period 

  a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against a future period’s profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods in periods when a company is generating operating losses its net operating loss carryforward will increase the income tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards is recorded as a deferred income tax asset if the company 

55   does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards it records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset additionally as defined in section 382 a change in control occurs and causes a limitation in the utilization of net operating losses when there is a 50 or greater change in the company’s ownership as determined over a rolling threeyear period 

  realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods we generated net operating loss carryforwards from inception through the first quarter of 2003 resulting from losses we incurred at each reporting period since inception we assessed the need for a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset from inception through march 31 2004 an allowance equal to 100 of the deferred tax asset was established as it was unlikely that we would be able to utilize such deferred tax assets 

   this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

   we charge certain of our institutional investor clients an information services fee and a monthly user access fee for the use of our trading platform the user access fees charged to an institutional investor client are reduced or eliminated if the institutional investor client meets certain minimum quarterly trading volumes 

  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the estimated collectibility of information and user access fees additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense which is included in the general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

   we recognize revenues relating to brokerdealer license fees in the first three months of the applicable agreement in the estimated amount of the setup costs incurred and the remaining amount is amortized over the initial term of the agreement which is generally three years 

   during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we have accounted for stockbased employee compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb no 25” as permitted by sfas no 123 in accordance with apb no 25 compensation expense is recognized for stock awards that have intrinsic value on the date of grant unearned compensation is amortized and charged to income over the vesting schedule our employee option grants usually vest over a threeyear period from the date of issuance 

56     had we adopted sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation transactions and disclosure” to expense the fair value of an employee grant over the appropriate vesting period we would have incurred stockbased employee compensation expense net of related tax effects of 14 million for the year ended december 31 2005 20 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 16 million for the year ended december 31 2003 

  the company will adopt sfas no 123r “share based payments” as of january 1 2006 which requires previously granted but unvested awards to be recorded as an expense on a prorated basis over the remaining vesting period had we adopted sfas no 123r we would have incurred additional stockbased employee compensation expense of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 14 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we expect the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 

   we allocated shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant to certain of our brokerdealer clients on a quarterly basis allocations under our warrant program were based on a percentage of the total quarterly commissions generated either on our us or our european trading platform by brokerdealer clients eligible for the warrant pool 

  we accounted for this warrant in accordance with sfas no 123 expense was recognized on the measurement date based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the warrant fair market value was determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model this pricing model requires the following inputs our underlying stock price the volatility of the underlying stock the expiration date of the warrant the riskfree rate of return and dividend payments on our stock the underlying stock price has been obtained using independent thirdparty valuations for the stock volatility factor we used a weighted average volatility over a 30month period for the nasdaq 100 index we determined the riskfree rate of return based on the interest rate of a threeyear us government obligation the expiration date of the warrant is november 30 2008 and we have assumed no dividend payments on our common stock the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march 1 2004 accordingly we will no longer record any warrantrelated expense

   as an electronic multidealer to client platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment pursuant to sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business

  total revenues increased by 28 million or 36 to 786 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 758 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase of interest income of 23 million and information and user access fees of 17 million offset in part by a decrease of 13 million in total commissions 

  total expenses increased by 85 million or 146 to 670 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 585 million for the comparable period in 2004 this increase was primarily due to increases of 44 million in professional and consulting fees 24 million in general and administrative expense 23 million in employee compensation and benefits 20 million in technology and communications and 11 million in depreciation and amortization expense offset by decreases in warrantrelated expense and moneyline revenue share in each case compared to the comparable period in 2004 

  during the year ended december 31 2005 we reduced the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets by 29 million to 152 million based on management’s current assessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded such factors include management’s expectation of continuing future profitable operations and judgment concerning future utilization of certain net operating losses that are subject to section 382 limitations prior to their expiration we believe it is likely but subject to some uncertainty that approximately 69 of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in 2018 in addition we adjusted the income tax rate used for recording the deferred tax assets resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense of 18 million without giving effect to the adjustment to the income 

59   tax rate used for recognizing the deferred tax assets and the reduction in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets our net income for the year ended december 31 2005 would have been 70 million

   commissions total commissions decreased by 13 million or 18 to 669 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 682 million for the comparable period in 2004 this decrease was primarily due to decreases in european highgrade commissions us highgrade commissions increased by 02 million or 03 to 456 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 455 million for the comparable period in 2004 european highgrade commissions decreased by 11 million or 70 to 141 million from 151 million for the comparable period in 2004 other commissions decreased by 03 million or 45 to 72 million from 76 million for the comparable period in 2004 the average fee per million across all markets for the year ended december 31 2005 including singledealer volume was 229 per million compared to 224 per million for the year ended december 31 2004 

  information and user access fees information and user access fees increased by 17 million or 635 to 44 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 27 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers to our corporate bondticker service 

  license fees license fees decreased by 02 million or 49 to 30 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 31 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this decrease was due to the addition of three new brokerdealer clients in the year ended december 31 2005 compared to four new brokerdealer clients added in the year ended december 31 2004 

  interest income interest income increased by 23 million or 2583 to 32 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 09 million for the comparable period in 2004 this increase was primarily due to higher cash cash equivalents and securities availableforsale balances during the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the comparable period in 2004 

  other other revenues increased by 02 million or 194 to 11 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 09 million for the comparable period in 2004 this increase was primarily due to a financial statement reclassification to recognize as revenue the gross telecommunication line fees paid by brokerdealer clients

  technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 20 million or 319 to 84 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 64 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was attributable to increased cost relating to market data production telecommunications and software maintenance as a percentage of total revenues technology and communications expense increased to 108 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 85 for the year ended december 31 2004 

  professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees increased by 44 million or 906 to 94 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 49 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily due to additional audit and tax legal insurance and investor relations expenses associated with being a public company as well as increased consulting and recruiting fees as a percentage of total revenues professional and consulting fees increased to 119 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 65 for the year ended december 31 2004 

61     marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense increased by 01 million or 20 to 26 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 25 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily due to expenses we incurred for print and other advertising used to promote our electronic trading platform 

  moneyline revenue share moneyline revenue share expense decreased by 13 million or 1040 to a benefit of 01 million from 12 million for the year ended december 31 2005 due to termination of the moneyline revenue share agreement and reversal of a prior period overaccrual in the first quarter of 2005 

  general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 24 million or 552 to 66 million for the year ended december 31 2005 from 43 million for the comparable period in 2004 this increase was due to a number of factors including increases in rent board of directors costs travel and entertainment valueadded tax and charitable contributions 

   during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded a provision for income taxes of 34 million we reduced the valuation allowance by 29 million to 152 million based on management’s current assessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded such factors include management’s expectation of continuing future profitable operations and judgment concerning future utilization of certain net operating losses that are subject to section 382 limitations prior to their expiration we believe it is likely but subject to some uncertainty that approximately 69 of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in 2018 in addition we adjusted the income tax rate used for recording the deferred tax assets resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense of 18 million without giving effect to the adjustment to the income tax rate used for recognizing the deferred tax assets and the reduction in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets our net income for the year ended december 31 2005 would have been 70 million 

  as of december 31 2005 the company had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of 1041 million the us net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2005 totaling 935 million will begin to expire in 2018 and the uk net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2005 totaling 106 million do not expire in 2000 and 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation had an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 as a result of section 382 and pertinent tax provisions the utilization of 343 million on a tax basis and 392 million on a book basis of the company’s net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the ownership change is subject to significant limitations in addition the company’s net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to additional annual limitations if there is a 50 or greater change in the company’s ownership as determined over a rolling threeyear period 

  during the year ended december 31 2005 two related parties converted 1325602 warrants into 1325249 shares of common stock through a noncash exercise resulting in a credit for federal income taxes purposes of 37 million which when realized would result in an increase in additional paidin capital management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty with regard to the ultimate realization of this tax credit and therefore has not recognized the credit in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31 2005 

  we cannot predict the timing of the reversal of certain of the temporary differences therefore the reversal of the temporary differences may result in charges to the provision for income taxes and may affect our future earnings

62   2003 this increase was primarily due to a net income tax benefit of 403 million that was recorded for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to the reduction of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset as is more fully described below without giving effect to the reduction of the valuation allowance our net income for the year ended december 31 2004 would have been 79 million 

  total revenues increased by 173 million or 300 to 758 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 585 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to the growth in the total volume of bonds traded on our platform which grew 550 to 2981 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 from 1923 billion for the comparable period in 2003 offset in part by an increasing portion of our total trading volume generated from european highgrade corporate bonds that carry a lower fee per million as well as by the introduction of the new us highgrade fee plans in the third quarter of 2003 total expenses increased by 44 million or 82 to 585 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 541 million for the comparable period in 2003 

  for the year ended december 31 2004 our total expenses increased primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits technology and communications professional and consulting fees marketing and advertising and general and administrative expense offset by decreases in depreciation amortization warrantrelated expense and moneyline revenue share in each case compared to the comparable period in 2003 

  during the year ended december 31 2004 we reduced the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets by 461 million from 643 million to 181 million due to the fact that we had achieved multiple quarters of profitability it became more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards we also determined that it was more likely than not that all of the temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes including the warrantrelated expense would be utilized prior to expiration we also recognized 21 million in tax credits and an additional tax benefit for operating losses of 15 million without giving effect to the reduction of the valuation allowance tax credits and reversal our net income for the year ended december 31 2004 would have been 79 million 

   our revenues and percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and the resulting dollar and percentage change are as follows 

   commissions total commissions increased by 154 million or 291 to 682 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 528 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was primarily due to increases in the amount of us highgrade commissions and substantial increases in european high 

63   grade commissions us highgrade commissions increased by 52 million or 128 to 455 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 403 million for the comparable period in 2003 european highgrade commissions increased by 80 million or 1125 to 151 million from 71 million for the comparable period in 2003 other commissions increased by 22 million or 410 to 76 million from 54 million for the comparable period in 2003 these increases were primarily due to an increase in transaction volume from 1922 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 to 2981 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 generated by new and existing clients offset by a 167 reduction in the average commission per million from 275 per million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 229 per million for the year ended december 31 2004 this decrease in average commission per million was attributable to the fullyear effect of our us highgrade fee plans increasing volumes of transactions with lower fees per million and an increase in the percentage of trades executed on the platform in bonds with shorter maturities which generally generate lower commissions per million 

  information and user access fees information and user access fees increased by 16 million or 1372 to 27 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 11 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers to our corporate bondticker service 

  license fees license fees decreased by 10 million or 242 to 31 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 41 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was due to the addition of four new brokerdealer clients in the year ended december 31 2004 compared to five new brokerdealer clients added in the year ended december 31 2003 

  interest income interest income increased by 05 million or 1377 to 09 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 04 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was due to a rise in interest rates and higher cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the comparable period in 2003 

  other other revenues increased to 09 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 00 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was primarily due to the effects of a change in accounting policy with respect to recognizing as revenue gross telecommunication line fees paid by brokerdealer clients these line fees were immaterial and were offset against the related technology and communications cost in prior years 

   our expenses and percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and the resulting dollar and percentage change are as follows 

 64     employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 63 million or 234 to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 269 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to the addition of new employees to support our growth and moneyline consultant staff that became our fulltime employees the total number of employees increased to 172 as of december 31 2004 from 159 as of december 31 2003 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense decreased to 437 for the year ended december 31 2004 from 459 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 12 million or 260 to 35 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 47 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily due to certain assets coming to the end of their depreciable lives during 2004 for the year ended december 31 2004 we capitalized 36 million of software development costs of which 30 million was placed in production depreciation and amortization of the remaining balance of 06 million will commence when the software becomes operational in november 2004 we determined that our trading platform software developed by us with input from moneyline a stockholder would be retired by march 31 2005 therefore we accelerated depreciation of this software during the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded additional depreciation in the amount of 01 million an additional 02 million was depreciated by march 31 2005 

  technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 16 million or 346 to 64 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 48 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was attributable to increased cost relating to data center hosting market data and office and production telecommunications as a percentage of total revenues technology and communications expense increased to 85 for the year ended december 31 2004 from 81 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees increased by 07 million or 174 to 49 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 42 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to additional legal accounting and insurance expenses associated with becoming a public company as a percentage of total revenues professional and consulting fees decreased to 65 for the year ended december 31 2004 from 72 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  warrantrelated expense warrantrelated expense decreased by 29 million or 533 to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 54 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily due to the fact that the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march 1 2004 

  marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense increased by 02 million or 104 to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 23 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to expenses we incurred for print and other advertising used to promote our electronic trading platform 

  moneyline revenue share moneyline revenue share expense decreased by 06 million or 313 to 12 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 18 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increased trading volume in us and european highgrade corporate bonds that is the basis for the revenue share calculation was offset by the changes in the us highgrade corporate bond fee plan in 2003 and the migration away from the moneyline platform to the new us highgrade platform in may 2004 

  general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 02 million or 46 to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 41 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was due to a number of factors including increase in occupancy expenses valueadded tax “vat” and franchise tax payments partially offset by the reversal of 02 million in a vat tax reserve taken in 2003 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded a net income tax benefit of 403 million the benefit consists of a reduction in the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset of 461 million the 

65   recognition of 21 million in tax credits and an additional tax benefit for operating losses of 15 million this was offset with a charge of 94 million which includes federal state and local and foreign taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance of 181 million against the gross deferred tax assets of 585 million arising from net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible the valuation allowance was reduced to 181 million during the year ended december 31 2004 based on our reassessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded such factors include seven consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the us and six consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the uk our expectation of continuing future profitable operations our anticipation that we would be able to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards during 2004 and our ability to utilize certain of the net operating loss carryforwards in future periods prior to their expiration we believed it was likely but subject to some uncertainty that approximately 62 of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in 2018 these net operating loss carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 due to the acquisition by us of 100 of the outstanding equity of trading edge this estimate assumes that all temporary differences will be utilized during this period and that a majority of the net operating loss carryforwards subject to section 382 limitations may expire prior to their utilization this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years due to annual utilization restrictions the net operating losses will be carried forward to future years 

  we cannot predict the timing of the reversal of certain of the temporary differences therefore the reversal of the temporary differences may result in charges to the provision for income taxes and may affect our future earnings 

   our quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of

70   proceeds of our initial public offering the increase in 2003 was due primarily to net cash provided by operations 

  past trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels a decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity business and financial condition

71   obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform the loss of or a significant reduction in the use of our electronic platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce our cash flows affect our liquidity and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months however our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream we may also acquire or invest in technologies business ventures or products that are complementary to our business in the event we require any additional financing it will take the form of equity or debt financing any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders any debt financings may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business 

  we have two major operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited marketaxess corporation is a registered brokerdealer in the us and marketaxess europe limited is a registered alternative trading system in the uk as such they are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by their respective market regulators that are intended to ensure general financial soundness and liquidity based on certain minimum capital requirements the us and the uk regulations prohibit a registrant from repaying borrowings from its parent or affiliates paying cash dividends making loans to its parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in its regulatory net capital position without prior notification to or approval from its principal regulator the capital structures of our subsidiaries are designed to provide each with capital and liquidity consistent with its business and regulatory requirements as of december 31 2005 marketaxess corporation had net capital of 148 million which was 137 million in excess of its required minimum net capital of 10 million marketaxess europe limited had financial resources as defined by the fsa of 109 million which was 75 million in excess of its required financial resources of 34 million

  in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

  as of december 31 2004 the company has provided a funding guarantee to its uk subsidiaries in the normal course of business to enable them to meet obligations to individual creditors through march 31 2005 to the extent these subsidiaries cannot meet such obligations themselves as the maximum obligation under this arrangement is unknown and as the uk subsidiaries are consolidated into the company no separate accrual for such guarantee has been made as of december 31 2005 no funding guarantee to the uk subsidiaries was necessary due to their profitability 

   because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

 item 1 business tableend   marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities our electronic trading platform is accessed by our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients either via a direct connection or over the internet our 539 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 22 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform we also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties since our inception the majority of our revenues have been generated from the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds although an increasing percentage of our revenues has recently been derived from the trading of european highgrade corporate bonds with limited exceptions our commissions are generated from transactions between a brokerdealer client and an institutional investor client 

  our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds and european highgrade corporate bonds we also offer our clients the ability to trade emerging markets bonds which we define as sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in a developing country including both highgrade and noninvestment grade debt to date however emerging markets bonds do not represent a significant component of our revenues 

  we derive our revenues primarily from commissions paid by our brokerdealer clients for trades executed on our platform which represented 899 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and to a lesser extent from license fees for access to our trading platform charged to certain of our brokerdealer clients which represented 41 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 and information and user access fees charged to our clients which represented 36 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 

  traditionally bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties this traditional process which is still how most corporate bonds are traded has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for 

1 these securities which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues in recent years an increasing number of corporate bond trading participants have utilized email and other electronic means of communication including proprietary singledealer systems for trading corporate bonds while this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity limited price transparency significant transaction costs compliance and regulatory challenges and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time 

  through our electronic platform our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security a process called price discovery as well as trade securities directly with our brokerdealer clients the price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the brokerdealer clients’ inventory available on our platform access to realtime pricing information and analytical tools including spreadtotreasury data search capabilities and independent credit research available on our corporate bondticker tm service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 18 of our brokerdealer clients during the trade process on average institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from brokerdealer clients in response to trade inquiries however some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers our services relating to trade execution include single and multipledealer inquiries list trading which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time and swap trading which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously with payment based on the price differential of the bonds once a trade is completed on our platform the brokerdealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated posttrade messaging which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and brokerdealer clients 

  with limited exceptions we are not a party to the actual trades that occur on our platform and we do not at any time take title to the traded securities or the proceeds from the sale of such securities rather we serve as an intermediary between brokerdealers and institutional investors enabling them to meet agree on a price and then transact with each other 

  our client base includes 22 of the leading brokerdealers in global fixedincome trading and 539 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 including 80 of the top 100 global holders of us corporate bonds as measured by thomson financial our brokerdealer clients accounted for approximately 99 of the underwriting of newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and in excess of 75 of the underwriting of newlyissued european highgrade corporate bonds in 2004 and include 13 of the top 15 brokerdealers as ranked by 2004 newissue underwriting volume of european highgrade corporate bonds we believe these brokerdealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in such securities as well as in sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security without substantially affecting the price of the security our brokerdealer clients currently trade fixedincome securities by traditional means including telephone email and proprietary singledealer systems in addition to our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future while we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the total volume of clienttodealer trading in these markets and therefore are unable to determine the portion of the trading that is taking place on our platform we believe that these traditional means of trading corporate bonds remain the manner in which the majority of corporate bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers 

   from january 2002 through the end of 2004 we experienced significant growth in total trading volume total commissions and net income as illustrated in the following table 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 615 of our trading volume was in us highgrade corporate bonds 257 of our trading volume was in european highgrade corporate bonds and 128 of our trading volume was in other bonds most of which are sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country 

industry background 

  fixedincome securities are issued by corporations governments and other entities and pay a preset absolute or relative rate of return the global fixedincome market is large and has experienced significant growth in trading volume and amount of debt outstanding over the last several years for example as of december 31 2004 in the us fixedincome market there were approximately 236 trillion of fixedincome securities outstanding including 47 trillion of us corporate bonds we are primarily active in three segments of the global fixedincome securities market us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country 

   the total us corporate bond market has experienced significant growth over the past five years the total amount of us corporate bonds outstanding has grown from 27 trillion as of december 31 1998 to 47 trillion as of december 31 2004 the average daily trading volume of us corporate bonds also grew from 190 billion in 2002 the first calendar year for which such data are available to 213 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 

  the us corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities investmentgrade debt socalled “highgrade” which typically refers to debt rated bbb — or better by standard  poor’s or baa3 or better by moody’s investor service debt rated below investmentgrade socalled “highyield” which typically refers to debt rated lower than bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s investor service and debt convertible into equity socalled “convertible debt” 

  the us highgrade corporate bond market which represents the largest subset of the us corporate bond market has seen significant growth in trading volume over the last several years several factors continue to drive growth in trading volume in this market including 

 3    factors similar to those described above also contributed to significant growth in trading volume in the us treasury market which is recognized as the most liquid fixedincome market in the world these factors include availability of realtime us treasury market prices 1982 introduction of interestrate derivatives mid1980’s advent of electronic trading of us treasury securities 1997 and an increase in the balance of outstanding us treasury debt 39 trillion as of december 31 2004 up from 6164 billion at december 31 1980 as a result the average daily trading volume in the us treasury market increased from 183 billion in 1980 to 4979 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 representing a compound annual growth rate or cagr of 148 

   the european highgrade corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products issuers and currencies we define the european highgrade corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to european investors primarily bonds issued by european corporations excluding bonds that are issued by a corporation domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in europe 

  we believe that the average daily trading volume in the european highgrade corporate bond market has grown significantly over the past five years driven by many of the same factors that have driven growth in the us highgrade corporate bond market in addition we believe the following factors unique to the european highgrade corporate bond market are also driving growth in trading volume 

 4  

   we define the emerging markets bond market generally to include us dollar or eurodenominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country these issuers are typically located in latin america asia or central and eastern europe examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include brazil colombia mexico peru the philippines russia turkey and venezuela 

  the institutional investor base for sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country has recently expanded to include many crossover investors from the more mainstream highyield and highgrade investment areas institutional investors have been drawn to sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country by their high returns and high growth potential as well as by a general trend toward positive economic and political reforms and improving economic performance in many emerging markets countries 

our competitive strengths 

  our electronic trading platform provides solutions to some of the shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods the benefits of our solution are demonstrable throughout the trading cycle 

   we believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading of us and european highgrade corporate bonds and sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths including 

   our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of 22 of the leading global securities brokerdealers and 539 active institutional investor firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 we believe these brokerdealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country our brokerdealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients which includes 80 of the top 100 global holders of us corporate bonds as measured by thomson financial we believe that if we continue to grow the participation of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients on our electronic trading platform the benefits in liquidity on the platform to both brokerdealers and institutional investors will be amplified further motivating them to use our platform currently the majority of trading of us highgrade corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading methods implying significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our trading volume our trading volume across all of our products increased from 117 billion in 2001 to 484 billion in 2002 to 1922 billion in 2003 and to 2981 billion in 2004 we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the size of the bond markets we serve specifically the clienttodealer market and therefore we are unable to 

5 accurately determine the total volume of secondary trading of these bonds or the portion of such trading conducted on our platform 

 

   we believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional bond trading methods including 

  competitive prices by enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our brokerdealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price for typical marketaxess multidealer corporate bond inquiries the range of competitive spreadtotreasury responses is on average approximately 10 basis points a basis point is 1100 of 1 in yield as an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors a one basis point savings on a 1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately 75000 

  transparent pricing on a range of securities the commingled multidealer inventory of bonds posted by our brokerdealer clients on our platform consists of a daily average of more than 130 billion in indicative bids and offers subject to applicable regulatory requirements institutional investors can search bonds in inventory based on any combination of issuer issue rating maturity spreadtotreasury size and dealer providing the listing in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually institutional investor clients can also request executable bids and offers on our electronic trading platform on any debt security in a database of us and european corporate bonds although there can be no assurance as to the number of brokerdealers who will choose to provide an executable price our platform transmits bid and offer requests in realtime to brokerdealer clients who may respond with executable prices within a time period specified by the investor 

  improved cost efficiency we believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery singlesecurity and multisecurity bid or offer lists inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple brokerdealers in addition our corporate bondticker eliminates the need for manuallyintensive phone calls or email communication to gather sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices 

   we also provide substantial benefits to our brokerdealer clients over traditional bond trading methods including 

  greater sales efficiency we offer our brokerdealer clients broad connectivity with their institutional investor clients through this connectivity our brokerdealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities we also enable brokerdealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access in addition the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at brokerdealer firms to focus their efforts on more profitable activities such as higher valueadded trades and more complex transactions 

  more efficient inventory management for brokerdealers the posting of inventory to and the ability to respond to inquiries from a broad pool of institutional investors creates an increased opportunity for brokerdealers to identify demand for their inventory particularly in less liquid securities as a result we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover which may limit credit exposure 

   we offer additional benefits over traditional bond trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and brokerdealer clients including 

  greater trading accuracy our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and brokerdealer clients these verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond at the agreedupon price and size our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader and from the trader to backoffice personnel this automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from information being manually entered into different systems 

  efficient risk monitoring and compliance our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and brokerdealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle this enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability trade information including time price and spreadtotreasury is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform these data also represent a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel importantly we believe the automated audit trail together with the competitive pricing that is a feature of our electronic trading platform gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients 

   in addition to services directly related to the execution of trades we offer our clients several other services including 

  information services the information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions our corporate bondticker provides access to realtime and historical price yield and marketaxess estimated spreadtotreasuries for publicly disseminated nasd traceeligible bonds corporate bondticker combines publiclyavailable trace data with the prices for trades executed on our us highgrade electronic trading platform integrating the two data sources and providing realtime trace data with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available in addition corporate bondticker provides indicative prices for secondary loans and credit default swaps through arrangements with certain of our brokerdealer clients and independent credit research our electronic trading platform allows institutional investors to compile sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual information gathering process or other electronic services

  some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include 

 our strategy 

  our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixedincome securities connecting brokerdealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently while offering a broad array of services to market participants across the trading cycle the key elements of our strategy are 

   we intend to further enhance the liquidity of securities traded on our leading electronic multidealer to client platform for us and european highgrade corporate bond trading and for the trading of sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform will help us deepen our market share with our existing clients as well as expand our client base which we believe will in turn lead to even further increases in the liquidity of the securities provided by our brokerdealer clients and available on our platform we will seek to make our current product offerings on our european electronic trading platform available to our 363 active us institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 and to make our current product offerings on our us electronic trading platform available to our 176 active european institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 in each case subject to regulatory requirements 

   we intend to leverage our technology as well as our strong brokerdealer and institutional investor relationships to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product segments within the fixedincome securities market in the future we intend to expand our product offerings to include among others credit derivatives due in part to our highly scalable systems we believe we will be able to enter into new markets with relatively little technology modification and low incremental costs 

   we plan to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is fully integrated into the workflow of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we also plan to continue to add functionality to allow our clients to achieve a fully automated endtoend straightthrough processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement we are continually considering the introduction of new trading techniques as an example we have the technology necessary to offer anonymous trading of fixedincome securities if and when the market opportunity for such a product arises we may also develop and expand our technology platform in order to create singledealer technology solutions that we can offer to our brokerdealer clients for internal order management and trade processing 

   we regularly add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondticker in order to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients examples of added content include pricing for syndicated loans and credit derivatives and independent credit research we intend to enter into distribution partnerships with information and data services companies in order to widen the user base of our data products and to continue adding new content and analytical capabilities in july 2004 we entered into an agreement with interactive data corporation through its subsidiary ft interactive data to promote and market corporate bondticker we expect this and other distribution partnerships to broaden our presence in the marketplace and increase our brand awareness we intend to seek out additional market leaders in various segments of the securities industry and leverage their existing customer bases and distribution channels to further our data services market penetration 

  as use of our electronic trading platform continues to grow we believe that the amount and value of our proprietary trading data will also increase further enhancing the value of our information services offerings to our clients 

   we plan to continue to increase and supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets provide new products or services or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients as an example during 2003 we entered into a strategic alliance with brokertec usa llc and brokertec europe ltd collectively “brokertec” in order to provide our institutional investor clients with an electronic system to buy and sell us treasury securities although this strategic alliance with brokertec terminated effective february 28 2005 we are working with our brokerdealer clients and others in order to continue to provide our institutional investor clients with an electronic system for the trading of us treasury securities

14   we cannot be assured that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors other companies including some in which certain of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

   nine of our brokerdealer clients abn amro bnp paribas banc of america bear stearns credit suisse first boston deutsche bank jpmorgan lehman brothers and ubs or their affiliates are stockholders of ours as of december 31 2004 these nine brokerdealer clients own 19674861 shares of our common stock our nonvoting common stock and shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants representing approximately 450 of our outstanding common stock to the extent that some or all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote similarly they are likely to be able to influence decisions requiring approval by our stockholders 

   for more information concerning the potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the various roles brokerdealer client and stockholder played by certain of our brokerdealer clients please see the section “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — risk factors that may affect future results — risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders” 

   we promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies our sales force of 16 people located in the us and seven persons located in the uk is organized into three teams us client sales european client sales and dealer relation groups both in the us and europe they are responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our platform by our existing clients their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use the system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixedincome trading platform we employ various strategies including advertising direct marketing promotional mailings and participation in industry conferences to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform for example we have worked with the wall street journal to establish corporate bondticker as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and highyield tables 

competition 

  the electronic trading industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face four main areas of competition 

 15    competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made or may in the future make investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us 

  in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

   we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the past two years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

  our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

  furthermore our brokerdealer clients have invested in building application programming interfaces with us for inventory contributions electronic trading government bond benchmark pricing and posttrade messaging we believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our brokerdealer clients increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to our services 

  many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

16   any combination of our competitors or our current brokerdealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future are potential competitors of ours 

technology 

  the design and quality of our technology are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure scalable clientserver architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed reliability and fault tolerance the platform is built on industrystandard technologies 

  all critical serverside components primarily our networks application servers and databases have backup equipment running in case the main equipment fails this offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure we also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure the majority of our brokerdealer clients have dedicated t1 lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer our security measures include industrystandard communications encryption 

  we have designed our application with an easytouse windowsbased interface through a secure single signon our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform we provide users an automatic software update feature which does not require manual intervention 

  we have completed the transition to new internallydeveloped software for our us highgrade corporate emerging markets and european bond platforms the new trading platforms incorporate the feedback we have received from our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients we expect that the new platforms will offer enhanced functionality and greater easeofuse additionally they will consolidate separate trading protocols and systems thereby reducing the ongoing development and maintenance costs associated with maintaining multiple technology platforms the new platforms have been designed initially to handle six times our current trading volume 

intellectual property 

  we rely upon a combination of copyright patent trade secret and trademark laws written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology processes and other intellectual property our software code elements of our electronic trading platform web site and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws we currently have five patent applications pending covering certain aspects of our business 

  the written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements and agreements with customers contractors and strategic partners other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent copyright trademark or trade secret rights

executive summary 

  marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities through our platform 539 active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 22 brokerdealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform our active institutional investor clients include investment advisers mutual funds insurance companies public and private pension funds bank portfolios and hedge funds we also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us and european highgrade corporate bonds 

  our multidealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing executable bids or offers from our brokerdealer clients and execute trades with the brokerdealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond we offer our brokerdealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds in addition to us highgrade corporate bonds and european highgrade corporate bonds we also offer our clients the ability to trade emerging markets bonds which we define as sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country including both investmentgrade and noninvestment grade debt 

  the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our brokerdealer clients on a monthly basis we also derive revenues from information and user access fees license fees and other income our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits depreciation and amortization technology and communication expenses professional and consulting fees warrantrelated expense marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 

  based on our limited operating history we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

   we operate in a highly competitive business environment in particular we compete with bond trading business conducted over the telephone between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients institutional investors have historically purchased fixedincome securities by contacting bond sales professionals at one or more brokerdealers by telephone or email and inquiring about the price and availability of individual bonds this remains the manner in which the majority of corporate bonds are traded between institutional investors and brokerdealers in addition there are numerous other electronic trading platforms 

24 currently in existence these include thomson tradeweb a multidealer to institutional investor trading platform and bloomberg which provides electronic trading functionality 

  we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of several factors including the liquidity provided on our platform the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform the quality and speed of execution total transaction costs technological capabilities including the ease of use of our trading platform and the range of our products and services we also believe that we are well positioned to respond to future challenges due to the experience and continuity of our senior management team 

  we seek to grow and diversify our revenues by capitalizing on our status as the operator of a leading platform for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixedincome securities the key elements of our strategy are 

 history 

  marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our fully disclosed multidealer platform began in october 2000 we launched trading on our electronic platform in january 2001 with eight brokerdealer clients since that time our brokerdealer clients have grown to include 22 of the leading securities firms our brokerdealer clients currently are abn amro banc of america securities barclays bear stearns bnp paribas citigroup credit suisse first boston deutsche bank dz bank ag first tennessee national goldman sachs hsbc ing financial markets jpmorgan lehman brothers merrill lynch morgan stanley the royal bank of scotland santander investment securities société générale ubs and wachovia 

  in march 2001 we acquired trading edge inc “trading edge” the operator of an anonymous trading platform for us corporate bonds convertible bonds municipal bonds and sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in emerging markets in an anonymous platform the identities of buyers and sellers of securities are not disclosed to each other rather the brokerdealer stands between buyers and sellers acting as riskless principal to both sides of each transaction two clearing brokers cleared all trades executed on the trading edge platform the marketaxess platform differs from the trading edge platform in that trading on the marketaxess platform is conducted on a fullydisclosed basis where buyers and sellers are aware of the other’s identity trades executed on the marketaxess platform are settled directly between the buyer and the seller with no credit risk exposure to marketaxess 

  in may 2001 we decided to halt development efforts for the convertible bond trading platform while continuing to operate that platform with its existing functionality in october 2001 we decided to terminate the municipal bond trading platform the decisions with respect to the convertible bond and municipal bond trading platforms were not contemplated at the time of the trading edge acquisition and resulted from lower 

25 than anticipated trading volumes on these platforms we currently maintain an anonymous trading platform capability for us corporate bonds convertible bonds and sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country although it is dormant 

  in august 2001 one of our uk subsidiaries marketaxess europe limited began operations with secondary electronic trading in us dollardenominated and eurodenominated corporate bonds 

  in february 2002 we reorganized into marketaxess holdings inc a holding company that operates primarily through two operating subsidiaries marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited these subsidiaries are registered as brokerdealers with applicable market regulators in the us and the uk respectively 

  we launched our information service corporate bondticker tm  in july 2002 corporate bondticker combines nasd trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide trading professionals research firms rating and news agencies and other market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond information 

  we have been funded by nine of our 22 brokerdealer clients through purchases of equity securities primarily convertible preferred stock for a total purchase price of 798 million in addition we acquired cash and investments at fair value totaling 364 million in connection with the acquisition of trading edge we also received net proceeds of 539 million from the sale of shares of our common stock in our november 2004 initial public offering as of december 31 2004 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 1034 million we have no outstanding debt 

critical factors affecting our industry and our company 

   the global fixedincome securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

   any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced trading activity in the fixedincome securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global fixedincome securities markets 

   the global fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their 

26 institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

   competitors including companies in which some of our brokerdealer clients have invested have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that compete or will compete with us 

  in general we compete on the basis of a number of key factors including 

   we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors our trading volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the past three years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 

  our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 

  many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have a substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wide range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

  any combination of our competitors or our current brokerdealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future are potential competitors of ours 

   our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant costs 

  the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required 

   we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

 trends in our business 

  the following table identifies changes in key financial measures of our business for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

 28   the majority of our revenues are primarily derived from commissions for transactions in us and european highgrade corporate bonds executed on our platform these commissions are paid by our 22 brokerdealer clients 

  most transactions executed on our platform are originated by our active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january 2004 and december 2004 consisting of 539 institutions as of december 31 2004 the volume of transactions executed across our platform is largely determined by the number of transaction inquiries originated by our institutional investor clients and the competitiveness of the prices they receive from our brokerdealer clients in response to these inquiries 

  the notional value of bonds traded over our platform has grown rapidly since the commercial launch of the platform in january 2001 the total notional value traded increased from 117 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 to 484 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 to 1922 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 and to 2981 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 this has resulted in revenues that have grown from 66 million for the year ended december 31 2001 to 187 million for the year ended december 31 2002 to 585 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and to 758 million in the year ended december 31 2004 

  our overall trading volume is impacted by volume in the corporate bond market generally various factors that have historically impacted overall corporate bond market trading volume include the absolute level of interest rates the direction of interest rate movements the level of new issues of us highgrade corporate bonds volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities economic conditions the geopolitical environment market psychology relative prices of competing asset classes and more importantly changes in expectations about inflation while we believe that trading volume is affected more by volatility in the corporate bond market than by the absolute levels of interest rates or the direction of interest rate changes we have limited experience with periods of rising interest rates if interest rates continue to rise it is possible that our trading volumes will continue to be adversely impacted because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes regardless of the cause of such decline would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on our future profitability 

   commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type and the maturity of the bond traded commission revenues have grown from 156 million for the year ended december 31 2002 to 528 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and to 682 million for the year ended december 31 2004 

  our standard fee schedule for us highgrade corporate bonds was revised in august 2003 to provide lower average transaction commissions for dealers who transact higher us highgrade volumes through our platform while at the same time providing us with an element of fixed commissions over the twoyear term of the plans one of the new plans that is well suited for our most active brokerdealer clients includes a fee cap that limits the potential growth in us highgrade revenue the fee caps were set to take effect at volume levels significantly above those being transacted at the time the new transaction fee plans were introduced most of our brokerdealer clients have entered into fee arrangements with respect to the trading of us highgrade corporate bonds that include both a fixed component and a variable component during periods of decreased or increased volume transacted on our system by those clients in this product the variable portion of the fee arrangement will result in decreased or increased revenue but the fixed portion of the fees will not be affected a continued period of decreased volume of us highgrade corporate bond trading on our platform could result in our being unable to renew these transaction fee arrangements on terms that are acceptable to us if at all to the extent that we are not able to renew these arrangements on their current terms or other terms that are acceptable to us our commissions in future periods could be negatively affected 

   in addition to the commissions discussed above we have also earned revenue from certain fees paid by institutional investor and brokerdealer clients income earned on investments and insurance recoveries revenues from these sources totaled 31 million for the year ended december 31 2002 57 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and 76 million for the year ended december 31 2004 we anticipate that revenues other than commissions will grow as we expand our data and information services offerings 

   growth in revenue and in the value of trades executed on our platform has been achieved without commensurate increases in expenses our total expenses were 548 million for the year ended december 31 2002 541 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and 585 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as a result we had a loss before income taxes of 361 million for the year ended december 31 2002 income before income taxes of 44 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and income before income taxes of 173 million for the year ended december 31 2004 

  in the normal course of business we incur the following expenses 

   we anticipate expense growth in the future notably in employee compensation and benefits professional and consulting fees and general and administrative expenses now that we are a public company but we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 

  as a public company we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which will require us to incur significant expenditures in the near term to establish systems and hire and train personnel to comply with these requirements in addition as a public company we are required pursuant to sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which will be effective on july 1 2005 to record compensation expense based on the fair value of options issued to employees currently we are only required to record compensation expense to the extent that the fair value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the options on the measurement date 

30 revenues and expenses 

   we derive our revenues from commissions from trades executed on our platform information and user access fees license fees and other income a table detailing the amount and percentage of revenue generated from each of these sources is provided below 

   we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of bonds traded on our platform and the amount of commissions earned by us 

   growth in the notional value of trades executed over our platform has been driven by an increase in the base of institutional investor clients our active institutional investor client base clients that executed trades through our electronic trading platform in the preceding year has increased from 301 as of december 31 2002 to 432 as of december 31 2003 and to 539 as of december 31 2004 however as the number of institutional investor clients has increased our volumes have been and will in the future be increasingly driven not only by new clients but also by existing clients executing a larger portion of their trading activity through our platform we believe that our ability to continue to deliver enhanced functionality and to provide reliable realtime access to our platform will be important factors in increasing usage of the platform by existing clients 

  our brokerdealer client base has also increased from 13 as of december 31 2002 to 18 as of december 31 2003 and to 22 as of december 31 2004 we believe that these brokerdealer clients represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in us highgrade corporate bonds european highgrade corporate bonds and sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country historical growth in the number of our brokerdealer clients is not necessarily indicative of future growth although it is likely that the majority of our future growth will be derived from additional trading by existing brokerdealer clients rather than from the addition of new brokerdealer clients 

  we commenced commercial operations in january 2001 with the launch of our us highgrade corporate bond platform we expanded the markets we serve to sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country in march 2001 and to european highgrade corporate bonds in 

31 september 2001 in the future we expect to leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new segments of the fixedincome securities market 

  as the notional value of bonds traded over our platform has grown we have also been more dependent on the overall level of activity in the markets in which we operate while we believe that trading activity in the fixedincome markets in which we operate has generally increased since our inception there have been periods in which such trading activity was flat or actually declined we have experienced fluctuations in trading volumes between quarters as a result of general economic conditions as well as factors specific to the fixedincome markets in which we operate these quarterly fluctuations have in the past created and may in the future create some variability in our revenues 

  our average commission on trades executed over our platform has declined from 321 per million for the year ended december 31 2002 to 275 per million for the year ended december 31 2003 and to 229 per million for the year ended december 31 2004 under the fee plans currently in place for secondary us highgrade corporate bond trading and european highgrade corporate bond trading the average fees per million will decline as trading volumes increase we also anticipate that some reduction in average fees per million for other products may occur in the future consequently past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 

  we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients nine of which are also our stockholders who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or third party platforms with institutional investors our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  during 2004 and 2003 the product mix of our revenues shifted specifically commissions from european highgrade corporate bonds became a more significant percentage of our revenues revenues from european highgrade corporate bonds grew from 10 million to 71 million and to 151 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively this represents percentage increases of 1127 and 6100 respectively for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 

  we intend to continue to diversify our revenue base as we continue to expand our service offerings we believe that there will be more opportunities for us to generate revenues from all of our trading and information services clients 

  the following table shows the extent to which the changes in revenue for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 were attributable to increases in volumes reductions in the average level of commissions charged the introduction of our information services or other factors 

   a table detailing the amount of revenues generated by our nine brokerdealer clients that are also stockholders abn amro banc of america securities bear stearns bnp paribas credit suisse first boston deutsche bank jpmorgan lehman brothers and ubs and their respective affiliates as well as the 

32 corresponding percentage of total revenues is provided below for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

   we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients that are also our stockholders commissions from these nine brokerdealer stockholders have decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to increased volume from existing brokerdealer clients that are not stockholders as well as the addition of new brokerdealer clients that are not stockholders potential reduction in the level of their equity ownership if these brokerdealer shareholders sell shares of our common stock in the future may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients and result in a reduction in our revenues and net income 

  our current fee plans may result in a reduction in average fees as trading volume increases we may also introduce new plans that could result in lower fees particularly where we believe that fee reductions will be offset by higher trading volumes historical trading volume and revenue are not necessarily indicative of future trading volume and revenue 

    while the vast majority of our commissions are generated from transactions between a brokerdealer client and an institutional investor client we generate a de minimus amount of our commissions from transactions between two brokerdealer clients commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type and the maturity of the 

33 bond traded the commission rates are generally set at levels that are based on a number of factors including fees charged by interdealer brokers in the respective markets average bidoffer spreads in the products we offer transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone and the trading volume executed through our platform by the brokerdealer completing the trade under our transaction fee plans bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 

  for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we experienced overall trading volume increases while the overall average fee per million traded has decreased as detailed in the table below 

   for volume reporting purposes transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the day the transactions were executed 

   prior to august 2003 all of our brokerdealer clients operated under a standard transaction fee plan for the secondary trading of us highgrade corporate bonds under the standard transaction fee plan commissions are calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of the bonds traded on our platform vary based on the type and maturity of the bond and are generally higher on bonds with longer maturities under this plan there is no fixed monthly fee and no cap on the aggregate amount of commissions payable by a brokerdealer client in august 2003 we offered our brokerdealer clients the opportunity to switch from the standard transaction fee plan to one of two new transaction fee plans for secondary us highgrade corporate bond trading these plans have a twoyear term which commenced on either august 1 2003 or september 1 2003 the plans differ in their fixed monthly fees amount of variable fees per trade and fee caps 

 34   the new transaction fee plans were introduced during the third quarter of 2003 to provide incentives for dealers who transacted higher volumes through the platform while at the same time providing us with an element of fixed commission revenue over the twoyear term of the new plans commissions for our us highgrade platform increased from 98 million for the three months ended june 30 2003 to 122 million for the three months ended september 30 2003 since september 30 2003 commissions for our us highgrade platform have remained relatively constant specifically commissions for our us highgrade platform starting with the threemonth period ended december 31 2003 through the threemonth period ended september 30 2004 were between 111 million and 115 million with commissions for the threemonth period ended december 31 2004 at 114 million due primarily to the new transaction fee plans average us highgrade commissions declined from 312 per million traded in the three months ended june 30 2003 to 259 per million traded in the three months ended december 31 2003 average us highgrade commissions declined further to 231 per million traded in the three months ended december 31 2004 these decreases in the average commission per million traded were more than offset by volume increases specifically our trading volume for us highgrade corporate bonds grew from 314 billion for the three months ended june 30 2003 to 494 billion for the three months ended december 31 2004 

  brokerdealer clients who selected either plan 1 or plan 2 for us highgrade corporate bond trading had the opportunity to switch to the other transaction fee plan in the second year currently 13 brokerdealer clients are operating under plan 1 one is operating under plan 2 and four are operating under our standard transaction fee plan our four remaining brokerdealer clients execute trades through our platform exclusively for european highgrade corporate or emerging markets bonds and are not therefore eligible to participate in our us highgrade corporate bond transaction fee plan currently seven brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders are operating under plan 1 one brokerdealer client who is also a stockholder is operating under plan 2 and one brokerdealer client who is also a stockholder is operating under the standard transaction fee plan the fee caps were set to take effect at volume levels significantly above those being transacted at the time the new transaction fee plans were introduced but will limit revenue growth in the future for us highgrade corporate bond trading from the brokerdealers that have selected these plans if the higher volume levels at which the fee cap is triggered are reached 

  the fee caps of plan 2 set an upper limit on the potential revenues for us highgrade corporate bond trading from our brokerdealer clients that select that transaction fee plan we believe that plan 2 is well suited for our most active brokerdealer clients and it is designed to encourage more trading volume on our platform for the year ended december 31 2004 and the year ended december 31 2003 had all brokerdealers been on the standard fee plan our commission revenue would have been greater by approximately 53 million and 14 million respectively management believes however that had the new fee plans not been in place we might have experienced lower transaction volumes in us highgrade corporate bonds 

  as the brokerdealer operating under plan 2 has not yet reached the monthly cap additional trading volume has resulted in incremental revenue for us in future periods if the caps are met we may be limited in our ability to offset declines in the average commission by additional trading volume for us highgrade corporate bonds due in part to the introduction of the fee caps of plan 2 historical growth in trading volume and commission revenue is not necessarily indicative of future growth 

   on our european platform brokerdealer transaction fees vary based on the type of bond traded different fee schedules apply to fixed rate and floating rate bonds within the schedule for fixed rate bonds the fee varies depending on whether the bond is a corporate or a sovereign issue for corporate bonds the fee also varies depending on the maturity of the issue this fee schedule applies a tiered fee structure which reduces the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a particular brokerdealer and does not carry a fixed monthly fee or fee cap the average commission on european highgrade transactions has decreased from 232 per million traded for the year ended december 31 2002 to 224 per million traded for the year ended december 31 2003 and to 198 per million traded for the year ended december 31 2004 this decrease in average commission per million traded was caused by a shift in the mix of bonds traded and by the impact of the tiered fee structure described above 

   brokerdealer clients pay a commission for transactions in sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country based on the type and amount of the security traded the commission is calculated on a standard schedule that applies to all brokerdealer clients and varies depending on whether the transaction is in an actively traded sovereign issue a less actively traded sovereign issue or a corporate issue a lower commission rate is charged for actively traded sovereign issues while a higher commission rate is charged for corporate issues the average commission on emerging markets transactions for the year ended december 31 2004 was 205 per million traded 

   for newlyissued us highgrade corporate bonds and for newlyissued sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country we enable us institutional investors to submit indications of interest on our electronic trading platform directly to the underwriter syndicate desks of our brokerdealer clients brokerdealer clients pay a commission for new issue transactions that is based on the allocation amount the commission is set as a percentage of the new issue selling costs paid by the issuer to our brokerdealer client the percentage of the new issue selling costs is lower on orders over 5 million the fee is capped on larger transactions there are currently no fixed monthly fees or caps on the level of monthly commissions the average commission on new issue transactions for the year ended december 31 2004 was 297 per million traded 

   in september 2004 we started trading us treasury securities on our trading platform in 2004 the total revenues we derived from the trading of us treasury securities on our platform was not material the commission is calculated as a flat fee per million of notional amount traded and applies to all brokerdealer clients please see “— risk factors that may affect future results — if we are unable to enter into additional marketing and strategic alliances or if our current strategic alliances are not successful we may not maintain the current level of trading or generate increased trading on our trading platform”

  institutional investor clients trading us highgrade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform the fee billed quarterly is charged to the client based on the number of the client’s users to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our us highgrade corporate bond platform we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained

  as of december 31 2004 we had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of 1024 million the us net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2004 totaling 897 million will begin to expire in 2017 and the uk net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2004 totaling 127 million do not expire in 2000 and in 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation respectively had an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 as a result of section 382 and pertinent tax provisions the utilization of 391 million of our net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the ownership change is subject to significant limitations in addition our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to additional annual limitations if there is a 50 or greater change in our ownership as determined over a rolling threeyear period 

  during the year ended december 31 2004 we reduced the valuation allowance by 462 million to 181 million based on management’s reassessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded such factors include seven consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the us and six consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the uk management’s expectation of our continuing profitable future operations management’s anticipation that we would be able to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in 2004 and our ability to utilize certain of the net operating loss carryforwards in future years prior to expiration we believe it is likely but subject to some uncertainty that approximately 76 of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in 2017 in addition we have temporary differences defined as the tax effect of the difference between the financial reporting basis and the tax reporting basis of certain balance sheet items of 135 million available as of december 31 2004 

   this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states also referred to as us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical that is these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

   we charge certain of our institutional investor clients an information services fee and a monthly user access fee for the use of our trading platform the user access fees charged to an institutional investor client are reduced or eliminated if the institutional investor client meets certain minimum quarterly trading volumes 

  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the estimated collectibility of information and user access fees additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense which is included in the general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations

  where a brokerdealer client has selected plan 2 of the new transaction fee plans for secondary us highgrade corporate bond trading the us highgrade commissions that it pays are capped at 05 million per month and 48 million per year if the commissions paid by a brokerdealer client in any one quarter measured from the effective date of the agreement exceed 12 million the excess commissions over 12 million are reserved and only recorded as revenue when the yeartodate commissions generated by the brokerdealer client either reach the annual 48 million cap or fall below a yeartodate quarterly average of 12 million 

   during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we have accounted for stockbased employee compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb no 25” as permitted by sfas no 123 in accordance with apb no 25 compensation expense is recognized for stock awards that have intrinsic value on the date of grant unearned compensation is amortized and charged to income over the vesting schedule our employee option grants usually vest over a threeyear period from the date of issuance 

  had we adopted sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation transactions and disclosure” to expense the fair value of an employee grant over the appropriate vesting period we would have incurred stockbased employee compensation expense of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and 03 million for the year ended december 31 2002 

40   beginning july 1 2005 the company will adopt sfas no 123r “share based payments” which requires previously granted but unvested awards to be recorded as an expense on a prorated basis over the remaining vesting period had we adopted sfas no 123r we would have incurred additional stockbased employee compensation expense of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2004 we expect the adoption of sfas no 123r will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 

   we allocated shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant to certain of our brokerdealer clients on a quarterly basis allocations under our warrant program were based on a percentage of the total quarterly commissions generated either on our us or our european trading platform by brokerdealer clients eligible for the warrant pool 

  we accounted for this warrant in accordance with sfas no 123 expense was recognized on the measurement date based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the warrant fair market value was determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model this pricing model requires the following inputs our underlying stock price the volatility of the underlying stock the expiration date of the warrant the riskfree rate of return and dividend payments on our stock the underlying stock price has been obtained using independent thirdparty valuations for the stock volatility factor we used a weighted average volatility over a 30month period for the nasdaq 100 index we determined the riskfree rate of return based on the interest rate of a threeyear us government obligation the expiration date of the warrant is november 30 2008 and we have assumed no dividend payments on our common stock the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march 1 2004 accordingly we will no longer record any warrantrelated expense 

   income taxes are accounted for on the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets arise as a result of our net operating losses and from the tax effect of various types of temporary differences including in our case differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and for financial statement purposes 

  realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods we generated net operating loss carryforwards from inception through the first quarter of 2003 resulting from losses we incurred at each reporting period since inception we assessed the need for a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset from inception through march 31 2004 an allowance equal to 100 of the deferred tax asset was established as it was unlikely that we would be able to utilize such deferred tax assets 

  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences certain of our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to significant limitations on annual utilization pursuant to the internal revenue code in addition our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to further annual limitations as a result of ownership changes in the future 

  as of december 31 2004 we had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of 1024 million the us net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2004 totaling 897 million will begin to expire in 2017 and the uk net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2004 totaling 127 million do not expire in 2000 and in 2001 marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation respectively had an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 as a result of section 382 and pertinent tax provisions the utilization of 391 million of our net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the ownership change is subject to significant limitations in addition our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to additional annual limitations if there is a 50 or greater change in our ownership as determined over a rolling threeyear period 

41   during the year ended december 31 2004 we reduced the valuation allowance by 462 million to 181 million based on management’s reassessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded such factors include seven consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the us and six consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the uk management’s expectation of our continuing profitable future operations management’s anticipation that we would be able to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards in 2004 and our ability to utilize certain of the net operating loss carryforwards in future years prior to expiration we believe it is likely but subject to some uncertainty that approximately 76 of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in 2017 in addition we have temporary differences defined as the tax effect of the difference between the financial reporting basis and the tax reporting basis of certain balance sheet items of 135 million available as of december 31 2004

  as of december 31 2002 the gross deferred tax asset was 680 million reduced to a net deferred tax asset of zero by recording a valuation allowance of 680 million while we were forecasting increasing revenues and a reduced loss for 2003 as well as net income for 2004 as evidenced by the projections used for the valuation of our common stock as of december 31 2002 management exercised judgment in assessing the positive evidence of the forecast future year earnings against the negative evidence of accumulated losses the uncertainty of attainment of forecast future year earnings and the potential likelihood of the realization of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for the year ended december 31 2002 the net loss was 361 million bringing the accumulated losses to 1180 million additionally 406 million of our net operating loss carryforward for financial income tax purposes of 1315 million was subject to section 382 limitations accordingly a 100 valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets was deemed appropriate as of december 31 2002 in addition we had temporary differences of 125 million available as of december 31 2002

   as an electronic multidealer to client platform for trading fixedincome securities our operations constitute a single business segment pursuant to sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” because of the highly integrated nature of the financial markets in which we compete and the integration of our worldwide business activities we believe that results by geographic region products or types of clients are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 income before taxes increased by 129 million to 173 million compared to income before taxes of 44 million for the year ended december 31 2003 net income increased by 544 million to 586 million compared to net income of 42 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to a net income tax benefit of 413 million that was recorded for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to the reduction of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset which is more fully described below without giving effect to the reduction of the valuation allowance our net income for the year ended december 31 2004 would have been 99 million 

  total revenues increased by 173 million or 300 to 758 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 585 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase in total revenues was primarily due to the growth in the total volume of bonds traded on our platform which grew 550 to 2981 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 from 1923 billion for the comparable period in 2003 offset in part by an increasing portion of our total trading volume generated from european highgrade corporate bonds which carry a lower fee per million as well as by the introduction of the new us highgrade fee plans in the third quarter of 2003 total expenses increased by 44 million or 82 to 585 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 541 million for the comparable period in 2003 

  for the year ended december 31 2004 our total expenses increased primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits technology and communications professional and consulting fees marketing and advertising and general and administrative expenses offset by decreases in depreciation amortization warrantrelated expense and moneyline revenue share in each case compared to the comparable period in 2003 

  during the year ended december 31 2004 we reduced the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets by 462 million from 643 million to 181 million due to the fact that we had achieved multiple quarters of profitability it became more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards we also determined that it was more likely than not that all of the temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes including the warrantrelated expense would be utilized prior to expiration we also recognized 16 million in tax credits and a reversal of a prior year overstatement of 10 million without giving effect to the reduction of the valuation allowance tax credits and reversal our net income for the year ended december 31 2004 would have been 99 million 

   our revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and the resulting dollar and percentage change are as follows 

   commissions total commissions increased by 154 million or 291 to 682 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 528 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was primarily due to increases in the amount of us highgrade commissions and substantial increases in european highgrade commissions us highgrade commissions increased by 52 million or 128 to 455 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 403 million for the comparable period in 2003 european highgrade commissions increased by 80 million or 1125 to 151 million from 71 million for the comparable period in 2003 other commissions increased by 22 million or 410 to 76 million from 54 million for the comparable period in 2003 these increases were primarily due to an increase in transaction volume from 1922 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 to 2981 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 generated by new and existing clients offset by a 167 reduction in the average commission per million from 275 per million for the year ended december 31 2003 to 229 per million for the year ended december 31 2004 this decrease in average commission per million was attributable to the fullyear effect of our us highgrade fee plans increasing volumes of transactions with lower fees per million and an increase in the percentage of trades executed on the platform with shorter maturities which generally generate lower commissions per million 

  information and user access fees information and user access fees increased by 16 million or 1372 to 27 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 11 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers to our corporate bondticker service 

  license fees license fees decreased by 10 million or 242 to 31 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 41 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was due to the addition of four new brokerdealer clients in the year ended december 31 2004 compared to five new brokerdealer clients added in the year ended december 31 2003 

  interest income interest income increased by 05 million or 1377 to 09 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 04 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was due to a rise in interest rates and higher cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the comparable period in 2003 

  other other revenues increased to 09 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 00 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was primarily due to the effects of a change in accounting policy with respect to recognizing as revenue gross telecommunication line fees paid by broker 

46 dealer clients these line fees were immaterial and were offset against the related technology and communications cost in prior years 

   our expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 and the resulting dollar and percentage change are as follows 

   employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits increased by 63 million or 234 to 331 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 269 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to the addition of new employees to support our growth and moneyline consultant staff that became our fulltime employees the total number of employees increased to 172 as of december 31 2004 from 159 as of december 31 2003 as a percentage of total revenues employee compensation and benefits expense decreased to 437 for the year ended december 31 2004 from 459 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 12 million or 260 to 35 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 47 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily due to certain assets coming to the end of their depreciable lives during 2004 for the year ended december 31 2004 we capitalized 36 million of software development costs of which 30 million was placed into production depreciation and amortization of the remaining balance of 06 million will commence when the software becomes operational in november 2004 we determined that our trading platform software developed by us with input from moneyline a stockholder would be retired by march 31 2005 therefore we accelerated depreciation of this software during the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded additional depreciation in the amount of 01 million an additional 02 million will be depreciated by march 31 2005 

  technology and communications technology and communications expense increased by 16 million or 346 to 64 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 48 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was attributable to increased cost relating to data center hosting market data and office and production telecommunications as a percentage of total revenues technology and communications expense increased to 85 for the year ended december 31 2004 from 81 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  professional and consulting fees professional and consulting fees increased by 07 million or 174 to 49 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 42 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to additional legal accounting and insurance expenses associated with becoming a public company as a percentage of total revenues professional and consulting fees decreased to 65 for the year ended december 31 2004 from 72 for the year ended december 31 2003 

47   warrantrelated expense warrantrelated expense decreased by 29 million or 533 to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 54 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily due to the fact that the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march 1 2004 

  marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense increased by 02 million or 104 to 25 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 23 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily due to expenses we incurred for print and other advertising used to promote our electronic trading platform 

  moneyline revenue share moneyline revenue share expense decreased by 06 million or 313 to 12 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 18 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increased trading volume in us and european highgrade corporate bonds that is the basis for the revenue share calculation was offset by the changes in the us highgrade corporate bond fee plan in 2003 and the migration away from the moneyline platform to the new us highgrade platform in may 2004 

  general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by 02 million or 46 to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2004 from 41 million for the comparable period in 2003 this increase was due to a number of factors including increase in occupancy expenses valueadded tax vat and franchise tax payments partially offset by the reversal of 02 million in a vat tax reserve taken in 2003 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded a net income tax benefit of 413 million the benefit consists of a reduction in the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset of 462 million the recognition of 16 million in tax credits and the reversal of a prior year overstatement of 10 million this was offset with a charge of 75 million which includes federal state and local and foreign taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance of 181 million against the gross deferred tax assets of 595 million arising from net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences relating to deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible the valuation allowance was reduced to 181 million during the year ended december 31 2004 based on our reassessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded such factors include seven consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the us and six consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the uk our expectation of continuing future profitable operations our anticipation that we would be able to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards during 2004 and our ability to utilize certain of the net operating loss carryforwards in future periods prior to their expiration we believe it is likely but subject to some uncertainty that approximately 76 of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in 2017 these net operating loss carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 due to the acquisition by us of 100 of the outstanding equity of trading edge this estimate assumes that all temporary differences will be utilized during this period and that a majority of the net operating loss carryforwards subject to section 382 limitations may expire prior to their ability to be utilized this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years due to annual utilization restrictions the net operating losses will be carried forward to future years 

  we cannot predict the timing of the reversal of certain of the temporary differences therefore the reversal of the temporary differences may result in charges to the provision for income taxes and may affect our future earnings

  the company’s us subsidiary marketaxess corporation maintains a securities clearing agreement with a clearing broker that commenced in december 2004 marketaxess corporation is contractually obligated to a minimum commitment fee of 0025 million per quarter with this commitment waived for the first 180 days of the relationship the securities clearing agreement also contains a termination fee if marketaxess corporation terminates the securities clearing agreement in calendar year 2005 it is obligated to pay 0025 million and if the termination occurs in calendar year 2006 or calendar year 2007 it is obligated to pay 0010 million under the securities clearing agreement marketaxess corporation maintains a collateral deposit with the clearing broker in the form of cash or us government securities as of december 31 2004 and 2003 marketaxess corporation had 05 million and 0307 million respectively of securities and cash on deposit with the clearing broker included in securities and cash provided as collateral 

  in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations warranties and general indemnifications our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred however based on past experience we expect the risk of loss to be remote 

  we have provided a funding guarantee to our uk subsidiaries in the normal course of business to enable them to meet obligations to individual creditors through march 31 2005 to the extent these subsidiaries cannot meet such obligations themselves as the maximum obligation under this arrangement is unknown and as the uk subsidiaries are consolidated for reporting purposes no separate accrual for such guarantee has been made 

   because the majority of our assets are liquid in nature they are not significantly affected by inflation however the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as employee compensation office leasing costs and communications expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

contractual obligations and commitments 

  the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of december 31 2004 

 57 risk factors that may affect future results 

risks related to the potential conflicts of interest with our brokerdealer clients 

who are also our stockholders 

we are dependent on our brokerdealer clients nine of which are also our stockholders who are not restricted from buying and selling fixedincome securities directly or through their own proprietary or thirdparty platforms with institutional investors 

  we rely on our brokerdealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries although each brokerdealer client is currently a party to an agreement with us the obligations of each brokerdealer under these agreements are minimal none of these agreements is exclusive and brokerdealers may terminate such agreements andor enter into and in some cases have entered into similar agreements with our competitors for example some of our brokerdealer clients are also clients of thompson tradeweb a multidealer to institutional investor trading platform that operates an online corporate bond trading platform 

  our brokerdealer clients buy and sell fixedincome securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods including telephone conversations email messaging and other electronic means of communication currently the preponderance of trading of us highgrade corporate bonds still occurs using traditional bond trading methods most of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels as trading participants andor as equity holders and such ventures or newly created ventures may compete with us and our electronic trading platform now and in the future 

  some of our brokerdealer clients have developed electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading networks these competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer furthermore our brokerdealer clients have made and may in the future continue to make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us including either individually or collectively organizing or investing in a separate company similar to us for the purpose of competing with us or pursuing corporate opportunities that might be attractive to us accordingly there can be no assurance that such brokerdealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors 

  any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our brokerdealer clients would reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform which could in turn reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues and an even greater percentage of our commissions from brokerdealer clients who are also our stockholders 

  we have historically earned a substantial portion of our commissions from the nine brokerdealer clients that are our stockholders for the year ended december 31 2004 393 million or 577 of our commissions for the year ended december 31 2003 330 million or 625 of our commissions and for the year ended december 31 2002 123 million or 790 of our commissions were generated by these nine brokerdealer clients none of our brokerdealer clients is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use our electronic trading platform reduced involvement of these brokerdealer clients due to their loss of a right to designate a member of our board of directors or the potential reduction in the level of their equity ownership if these entities should sell shares of our common stock may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients the loss of or a significant reduction of participation on our platform by these brokerdealer clients may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

   as of december 31 2004 nine of our brokerdealer clients or their affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 450 of our outstanding common stock these brokerdealer clients have strategic interests that are different from ours and those of our other stockholders for example in their capacity as brokerdealer clients they would presumably favor lower commissions andor commission caps furthermore as stockholders in other consortia that have developed competitive electronic trading networks or have announced their intention to explore the development of competitive electronic trading networks they may decide to direct some or all of their electronic trading business to one or more of our competitors while these actions if taken would presumably reduce our revenues and our market capitalization and therefore the value of their ownership position in us there can be no assurance that they will not decide to take such actions for their own strategic reasons 

  we are not a party to any voting agreement with any of our stockholders and are not aware of any voting agreements among our brokerdealer clients however they may enter into a voting agreement in the future or otherwise vote in a similar manner to the extent that all of these brokerdealer clients or their affiliates vote similarly they will be able to determine decisions requiring approval by our stockholders as a result they or their affiliates may be able to 

   as a result of these factors we may be less likely to pursue relationships with strategic partners who are not stockholders of ours which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position furthermore these factors could also limit stockholder value by preventing a change in control or sale of marketaxess 

   all of the shares of common stock and nonvoting common stock owned by our brokerdealer clients are subject to a lockup agreement with the underwriters of our initial public offering pursuant to which such shares may not be sold for a period of 180 days following the date of the pricing of our initial public offering november 4 2004 subject to compliance with the federal securities laws all of these shares will become available for resale in the public market after 180 days after the effective date of our initial public offering november 5 2004 subject in the case of “affiliates” of marketaxess to volume limitations on resale 

  in addition to the extent any future sales of common stock by our brokerdealer clients result in an “ownership change” within section 382 we may not be able to realize certain income tax benefits resulting from our net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of such ownership change for more information regarding these potential income tax benefits and our net operating loss carryforwards see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — revenues and expenses — income taxes” 

59 risks related to our business 

   the fixedincome securities industry generally and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular are highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between brokerdealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically in addition our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include 

   many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial engineering technical marketing and other resources these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixedincome or equity securities in addition many of our competitors offer a wider range of services have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 

  any combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions we expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer if we are not able to compete successfully in the future our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we have experienced losses and may incur losses in the future 

  our losses were 168 million from the period of inception through december 31 2000 651 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 361 million for the year ended december 31 2002 for the year ended december 31 2003 we reported net income of 42 million and for the year ended december 31 2004 we reported net income of 586 million which included 462 million in income which was recognized upon our reassessment of the likelihood of realization of a portion of our deferred tax assets we expect that our expenses will increase in the near term as we continue to expand our business and in order to meet the requirements related to being a public company we cannot predict whether we will be able to sustain profitability and we may incur losses in future periods if we are not able to sustain profitability our stock price may decline 

neither the sustainability of our current level of business nor our historical growth can be assured even if we do experience growth we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably 

  the use of our electronic trading platform is relatively new the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain and expand the network of brokerdealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our 

60 platform by these clients individuals at brokerdealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests which may discourage their use of our platform 

  our growth is also dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base we currently derive a majority of our revenues from secondary trading in us highgrade corporate bonds our trading volume for us highgrade corporate bonds has remained relatively constant during the year ended december 31 2004 and our commissions from such trading have also remained relatively constant during the year our longterm business strategy is dependent on expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixedincome products and other sources we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability 

  our plans to pursue other opportunities for revenue growth are at an early stage and we cannot assure you that our plans will be successful or that we will actually proceed with them as described 

because we have a limited operating history it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 

  marketaxess was formed in april 2000 and pilot trading on our electronic trading platform began in october 2000 with the commercial launch of the platform in january 2001 as a result we have only a limited operating history from which you can evaluate our business and our prospects we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by earlystage companies in rapidly evolving industries such as the electronic financial services industry these risks and difficulties include but are not limited to our ability to 

   if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer 

the cap we instituted on one of our pricing plans relating to commissions and fees paid by brokerdealers on our us highgrade corporate bond trading platform could limit our revenues 

  for the year ended december 31 2002 716 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 690 of our revenues and for the year ended december 31 2004 600 of our revenues came from the commissions paid directly by brokerdealer clients for secondary trading of us highgrade corporate bonds on our electronic trading platform in 2003 we offered our brokerdealer clients the opportunity to switch to one of two new transaction fee plans for secondary us highgrade corporate bond trading each of which includes a fixed monthly fee component and a variable fee per trade component for one of these new transaction fee plans the aggregate amount of transaction fees payable by a brokerdealer client for us highgrade corporate bond trading is capped on a monthly and an annual basis currently one of our brokerdealer clients has selected the pricing plan that includes the fee cap while the fee cap is designed to encourage our brokerdealer clients to be more active on our electronic trading platform the fee cap limits the maximum 

61 amount of commissions payable to us by our most active brokerdealer clients which could limit our revenues and constrain our growth and profitability 

decreases in trading volumes in the fixedincome markets generally or on our platform could harm our business and profitability 

  we have experienced decreases in overall trading volume in certain periods including specifically during the three months ended june 30 2004 and may experience decreases in trading volume in the future declines in the overall volume of fixedincome securities trading and in market liquidity generally as well as declines in interest rate volatility result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities 

  likewise decreases in our share of the segments of the fixedincome trading markets in which we operate or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated could result in lower trading volume on our platform and consequently lower commissions and other revenue during periods of increased volatility in credit markets the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with brokerdealers in addition during rapidly moving markets brokerdealers may be less likely to post prices electronically 

  a decline in trading volumes on our platform for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because our commissions are largely variable but a significant portion of our costs is fixed 

if we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenues and earnings expectations our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice 

  due to our limited operating history our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our industry we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results we base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenues and future rate of growth our expenses and investments are to a large extent fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenues fall short of our expectations 

  our revenues and operating results may also fluctuate due to other factors including 

   as a result our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis which could result in decreases in our stock price 

62 we may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform new services andor service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner which could harm our competitive position 

  our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to and new versions of our electronic trading platform the success of new features and versions depends on several factors including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version in addition the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and costeffective basis it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as we enter new markets we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets 

  our strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets even if we do adapt our software and technology we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets we cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful if these efforts are not successful we may realize less than expected earnings which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock furthermore these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources 

rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients 

  we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models if new industry standards and practices emerge our existing technology systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed our future success will depend on our ability to 

   developing our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform information databases and network infrastructure to brokerdealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards for example our electronic trading platform functionality that allows searches and inquiries on bond pricing and availability is a critical part of our service and it may become outofdate or insufficient from our brokerdealer clients’ or institutional investor clients’ perspective and in relation to the inquiry functionality of our competitors’ systems if we face material delays in introducing new services products and enhancements our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors 

  further the adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transactionprocessing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements 

63 we depend on thirdparty suppliers for key products and services 

  we rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading information and other systems as well as computers and other equipment and related support and maintenance we cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient costeffective manner if at all or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  in particular we depend on a thirdparty vendor for our corporate bond reference database disruptions in the services provided by that third party to us including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products that are critical to the success of our business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we also rely and expect in the future to continue to rely on third parties for various computer and communications systems such as telephone companies online service providers data processors and software and hardware vendors other third parties provide for instance our data center telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing support and maintenance services any interruption in these or other thirdparty services or a deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service we cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely 

  we license software from third parties much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business we also hire contractors to assist in the development quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  we attempt to negotiate favorable pricing service confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our service providers these contracts usually have multiyear terms however there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms further the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and contracts 

our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform systems and infrastructure our computer systems may suffer failures capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients 

  in order to be successful we must provide reliable realtime access to our electronic trading platform for our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients if our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times unreliable service or insufficient capacity our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients may decide to stop using our platform which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  as our operations grow in both size and scope we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume the trading practices of new and existing clients regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features functionalities and ancillary products and services the expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required and will continue to require substantial financial operational and technical resources these resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance furthermore we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems and the development of these new technologies also entails 

64 technical financial and business risks we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform technology and systems to the requirements of our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards the inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business 

  we have completed the transition of our european bond platform to our internallydeveloped software our european bond platform accounted for over 20 of our aggregate revenues and approximately 25 of our aggregate trading volume in 2004 

  we cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures our electronic trading platform computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage interruption or failure as a result of among other things 

   in the event that any of our systems or those of our thirdparty providers fail or operate slowly it may cause any one or more of the following to occur 

   any system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems could damage our reputation business and brand name and lead our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform 

  in these circumstances our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate similarly although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly in addition our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 

  we also cannot assure you that we have sufficient personnel to properly respond to system problems we internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks including those underlying our electronic trading platform our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or if necessary to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and costeffective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

65 if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform brokerdealers and institutional investors may become hesitant to use or reduce or stop their use of our trading platform 

  our electronic trading platform involves the storage and transmission of our clients’ proprietary information the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and possible liability if our security measures are breached as a result of thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause brokerdealers and clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems including reputational harm and litigation caused by any breaches although we intend to continue to implement industrystandard security measures we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient 

   intellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology we rely primarily on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as license agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights we attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees consultants advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information we have filed five patent applications covering aspects of our technology andor business but can make no assurances that any such patents will be issued or if issued will protect our business and processes from competition additionally laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties for instance a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products furthermore we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 

  we may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive and the outcome would not be certain in addition the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

defending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others we could be required to redesign our products pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 

  in the technology industry there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights as the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights from time to time in the ordinary 

66 course of our business we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps any claims whether with or without merit could 

   we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products try to redesign our products or services enter into royalty arrangements if available or engage in litigation that could be costly to us any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to enter into additional marketing and strategic alliances or if our current strategic alliances are not successful we may not maintain the current level of trading or generate increased trading on our trading platform 

  during 2003 we entered into a strategic alliance with brokertec in order to provide our institutional investor clients with an electronic system to buy and sell us treasury securities although this strategic alliance with brokertec terminated on february 28 2005 we are working with our brokerdealer clients and others to provide our institutional investor clients with an electronic system for the trading of us treasury securities we cannot assure you that we will be able to offer our institutional investor clients uninterrupted access to an electronic system for the trading of us treasury securities 

  from time to time we may enter into additional strategic alliances that will enable us to enter new markets provide products or services that we do not currently offer or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients 

  entering into joint ventures and alliances entails risks including 

   we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into new strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us or at all these arrangements if entered into may not generate the expected number of new clients or increased trading volume we are seeking unsuccessful joint ventures or alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

67 if we acquire or invest in other businesses products or technologies we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions 

  if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses products or technologies that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business product or technology such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

   these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time as well as outofpocket costs 

  the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock including options or other rights existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease in addition acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt large onetime writeoffs such as of acquired inprocess research and development costs and restructuring charges they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests which could result in future impairment charges 

we are dependent on our management team and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 

  our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel particularly richard m mcvey our president chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors the terms of mr mcvey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of nonvested equity options any loss or interruption of mr mcvey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively andor pursue our business strategy 

68 because competition for our employees is intense we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

  we strive to provide highquality services that will allow us to establish and maintain longterm relationships with our brokerdealer and institutional investor clients our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally depends in large part upon our employees we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internetrelated services hardware engineers technicians product managers and senior sales executives 

  the market for qualified personnel has grown more competitive in recent periods as electronic commerce has experienced growth domestic and international labor markets have tightened in concert with the continuing recovery in general economic conditions many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are longer established in the marketplace in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the internet hightechnology and financial services industries job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered including the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees furthermore proposed changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states relating to the expensing of stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock option awards that job candidates may require to join our company 

  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel the failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation and our relationships with our brokerdealer clients may subject us to increasing regulatory scrutiny 

  the financial industry is extensively regulated by many governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations including the us securities and exchange commission sec and the national association of securities dealers inc nasd as a matter of public policy these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets these regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret investigate and sanction noncompliance with their laws rules and regulations 

  most aspects of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are highly regulated including 

   we cannot assure you that we andor our directors officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws rules and regulations if we fail to comply with any of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to censure fines ceaseanddesist orders suspension of our business suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our membership in the nasd and registration as a brokerdealer 

  changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies including the rules relating to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the 

69 interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development of affected markets to become impractical in addition as we expand our business into new markets it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws rules and regulations we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations 

  our disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under regulation ats a determination by the sec to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to regulation ats would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business many of which could be material 

  as an enterprise founded and historically controlled by brokerdealer competitors we may be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny of our business to a degree that is not likely to be experienced by some of our competitors in november 2000 we received a civil investigative demand from the us department of justice in connection with the antitrust division’s investigation of electronic bond and other consortia trading systems after compliance with all information requests we recently received notice from the us department of justice that the investigation is now officially closed as the use of our electronic trading platform grows and represents a greater share of the trading volume of fixedincome securities the risk that other regulatory investigations could commence in the future increases additionally the involvement of individuals affiliated with certain of our brokerdealer clients on our board of directors and as stockholders may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business at any time the outcome of investigations and other regulatory scrutiny could lead to compulsory changes to our business model conduct or practices or our relationships with our brokerdealer clients or additional governmental scrutiny or private lawsuits against us any of which could materially harm our revenues impair our ability to provide access to the broadest range of fixedincome securities and impact our ability to grow and compete effectively particularly as we implement new initiatives designed to enhance our competitive position 

  the activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we expect to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states however we may face special economic and regulatory challenges that we may not be able to meet 

  we operate an electronic trading platform in europe and we plan to further expand our operations throughout europe and other regions there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets particularly in the financial services industry which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the united states these risks include 

 70   our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it 

  our business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements historically we have satisfied these needs primarily through equity financing from certain of our brokerdealer clients our acquisition of trading edge inc internally generated funds and most recently our initial public offering although we believe that our available cash resources are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months we may in the future need to raise additional funds to among other things 

   we may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all our existing investors including our brokerdealer clients and their affiliates have no obligation to make further investments in us and we do not anticipate that they will do so if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us our ability to fund our expansion take advantage of acquisition opportunities develop or enhance our services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

  as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and may place undue strain on our systems and resources the securities exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight will be required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  these rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors additionally we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage nasdaq rules also require that a majority of our board of directors and all of certain subcommittees of the board of directors consist of independent directors we cannot assure you that our board of directors will continue to include a majority of independent directors to comply with the requirements of these rules 

71 we are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability 

  many aspects of our business and the businesses of our clients involve substantial risks of liability dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution improperly settled trades mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers we and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us we could incur significant legal expenses defending claims even those without merit an adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our industry 

if the use of electronic trading platforms does not continue to increase we will not be able to achieve our business objectives 

  the success of our business plan depends on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixedincome products historically fixedincome securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and brokerdealers the utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance adoption and growth of electronic means of trading securities we cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue 

weak economic conditions in the united states and in the other countries and geographic areas in which we offer our services may negatively impact our business 

  in recent years the united states and other international markets in which we offer our services have experienced a significant economic downturn in addition the united states and other countries in which we offer our services have recently suffered acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostilities these or similar acts have in the past increased or prolonged and may in the future increase or prolong negative economic conditions an economic downturn may impact our ability to maintain profitability by negatively affecting demand for our services 

economic political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services and harm our business and our profitability could suffer 

  the global financial services business is by its nature risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the us and global financial services markets resulting in reduced trading volume these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors include 

   any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global financial markets
