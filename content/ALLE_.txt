we sell a wide range of security and access control solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential facilities worldwide including the education healthcare government hospitality commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our leading brands include cisa® interflex® lcn® schlage® simonsvoss® and von duprin® we believe lcn schlage and von duprin hold the no 1 or no 2 position in their primary product categories in north america while cisa interflex and simonsvoss hold the no 1 or no 2 position in their primary product categories in certain european markets 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we generated net revenues of 28674 million and operating income of 5302 million 

history and developments 

we were incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of what was then ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 we became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 100 years ago and many originally created their categories 

• von duprin established in 1908 was awarded the first exit device patent 

• schlage established in 1920 was awarded the first patents granted for the cylindrical lock and the push button lock 

• lcn established in 1926 created the first door closer 

• cisa established in 1926 devised the first electronically controlled lock and 

• simonsvoss established in 1995 created the first keyless digital transponder 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products for example in 2018 we announced the formation of allegion ventures a corporate venture fund with an initial allocation of 50 million to invest in and help accelerate the growth of companies that have innovative digitalfirst technologies and products such as touchless access and workspace monitoring solutions that complement our core business solutions building on this success in december 2021 allegion ventures announced a second fund with an additional allocation of 100 million to focus on investing in technologies like artificial intelligence machine learning and cybersecurity 

recent examples of successful product launches by allegion are illustrated in the table below 



industry and competition 

the global markets we serve encompass institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets throughout north america europe asia and oceania we expect the security products industry will continue to benefit from favorable trends such as increased concerns about safety and security new attention on touchless solutions that help promote a healthy environment and technologydriven innovation that enables seamless access and a better user experience as people and assets traverse multiple locations and facilities further we also expect continued growth in connected security products and solutions as endusers continue to adopt newer technologies including iot in their facilities and single and multifamily homes 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab and dormakaba group we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologically advanced product categories we may also compete against new more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth innovation integration with popular technology platforms quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision point we also compete based on the breadth innovation and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters in the northern hemisphere our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth quarters however certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth quarter due to project timing in 2020 we experienced lower sales volumes during the second quarter principally due to the economic challenges stemming from the covid19 pandemic however this is not anticipated to be a longterm trend in the seasonality of our businesses net revenues by quarter for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows

our respect for human rights is expressed in standards for our employees our business partners our customers and our communities we have adopted and continue to uphold our global human rights policy with standards that align with basic working conditions and human rights concepts advanced by international organizations such as the international labor organization and the united nations this policy also represents our own minimum standards for working conditions and human rights in our business and supply chains in addition we conduct risk assessments and continue to have conversations with the suppliers and companies we work with about the importance of human rights 

employee health and safety 

employee health and safety are top priorities and we consistently rank as the safest among leading competitors on core measures such as the total recordable incident rate ‘be safe be healthy’ is a core organizational value in our proactive safety culture and has guided our response to the covid19 pandemic throughout 2020 and 2021 we have adopted numerous health and safety measures in accordance with bestpractice safe hygiene guidelines issued by recognized health experts like the us centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” the european centre for disease prevention and control “ecdc” and the world health organization “who” as well as any applicable government mandates we continue to adapt to changing health conditions at a local level and support a wide range of health and safety measures including reduced density remote and hybrid work options for appropriate roles cleaning and hygiene protocols visitor management and maskwearing we also encourage preventative measures including covid19 and influenza vaccines and booster shots 

the ceo and senior executives have responsibility for risk management employee accountability and safety hazard recognition and take a personal responsibility toward executing on safety initiatives we monitor leading and lagging indicators related to health and safety as part of our ongoing management of the allegion operating system and regularly update the corporate governance and nominating committee of the board of directors on key accomplishments and employee health and safety topics in recognition of our efforts over the past several years to integrate sound environmental health and safety ehs management with our business operations in 2021 we received the renowned robert w campbell award from the national safety council 

regulatory matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the us relating to environmental health and safety concerns we are committed to conducting our business in a safe environmentally responsible and sustainable manner in compliance with all applicable ehs laws and regulations and in a manner that helps promote and protect the health and safety of our environment associates customers contractors and members of our local communities worldwide environmental social and governance esg matters are embedded into the allegion operating system and in tandem with our values and allegion leadership behaviors create a workplace culture committed to doing the right thing in the right way our board of directors oversees the companys esg initiatives strategies goals and performance and company leaders and our employees all have a responsibility to uphold excellence as we believe esg helps advance engagement and business vitality we operate with principles that support our proactive commitments including 

• integrating sound ehs and sustainability strategies in all elements of our business functions including objectives and measurements 

• conducting periodic formal evaluation of our compliance status and annual review of objectives and targets 

• creating a workplace culture where all employees are responsible for safety 

• making continuous improvements in ehs and sustainability management systems and performance including the reduction in the usage of natural resources waste minimization prevention of pollution and prevention of workplace accidents injuries and risks 

• designing operating and maintaining our facilities in a manner that minimizes negative ehs and sustainability impacts 

• using materials responsibly including where feasible the recycling and reuse of materials and 

• acting in a way that shows sensitivity to community concerns about ehs and sustainability issues 

we recognize that these principles are critical to our future success we have a dedicated environmental program designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate any identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities we also regularly evaluate our 

remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have from time to time received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

further during 2021 we provided additional transparency on our sustainability priorities and progress by creating a new esg section of the corporate website found under the esg tab at wwwallegioncom  the website highlights our ongoing progress and advancements in esg including the development of the crossfunctional esg council which was formed in 2020 and establishing allegion’s materiality matrix of esg priorities

strategic and operational risks 

our business operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the global covid19 pandemic we are unable to predict the full extent to which the pandemic and related impacts including macroeconomic impacts and the pace of global economic recovery will continue to adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain the spread of covid19 or mitigate this pandemic have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in various countries around the world this pandemic has also caused and may continue to cause disruption to our global supply chain and business operations in addition to the various effects noted elsewhere within the risk factors contained in this annual report on form 10k numerous actions taken to help limit the spread of covid19 such as stayathome orders quarantines increased border controls and closures business shutdowns and other public health and government mandates that restrict business activities and travel have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability to carry out business as usual including the temporary suspension of some of our operations shortages in materials parts and components fluctuations in customer demand costs associated with operational changes and an extended period of remote work arrangements for some of our employees which could increase cybersecurity risks and other operational risks conversely as some governments ease their restrictions and social interactions increase prior to the widespread global distribution and adoption of effective vaccines or treatments for covid19 and as the covid19 virus mutates into more contagious or severe variants preventative and precautionary measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of increased infection and could result in increased illness among our employees business partners and others and lead to further business interruption 

in addition our operations as well as a significant number of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners have been and continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic in particular shortages in commodities and materials including shortages and reductions in allocations of electronic and other components from key suppliers labor shortages and elevated levels of employee absenteeism freight delays and other supply chain constraints and disruptions have significantly delayed or disrupted and may continue to adversely impact both our suppliers’ and our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers we have also experienced a significant increase in commodity parts and material component inflation in 2021 as well as inflation in other costs such as packaging freight labor and energy prices continued supply chain disruptions and delays as well as continued heightened inflation could lead to continued periodic production interruptions and other inefficiencies that could negatively impact our productivity margin performance and our results of operations 

further we have experienced increased labor shortages at some of our production and distribution facilities while we have historically experienced some level of ordinary course turnover of employees the covid19 pandemic and resulting impacts have exacerbated labor shortages and increased employee turnover a number of factors have had and may continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us including reduced employment pools increased competition for manufacturing employees any unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic and other government regulations which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety wage and hour practices and immigration it is also uncertain to what extent any covid19 vaccine mandates if imposed or implemented may result in further workforce attrition labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our company have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production facilities or otherwise operate at full capacity an overall or prolonged labor shortage lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor cost inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations results of operations liquidity or cash flows 

despite our best efforts to manage and mitigate the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic to the company their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of this pandemic the 

emergence and spread of more contagious or severe variants of the covid19 virus the continuing prevalence of severe unconstrained or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions the availability adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines future actions taken by public health and governmental authorities including any unintended consequences of such actions and the pace of global economic recovery further to the extent our management is focused on mitigating the impacts of the covid19 pandemic which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources our attention and resources may be diverted from other business matters 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate impact on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict the continued spread of covid19 may have further adverse impacts on our business operations customer demand supply chain cash flow generation financial position and liquidity and may also exacerbate other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k 

increased competition including from technological developments could adversely affect our business 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational regional and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise effective channels to market breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases further in a number of our product offerings we compete with our retail customers and technology partners who use their own private labels if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives including increased competition from private label brands the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical electronic and digital products technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape our success depends in part upon the research development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete the continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services that meet the varied and evolving needs of our customers and endusers in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer and consumer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business either due to a reduction in demand from one or more of our significant customers or our inability to timely meet the elevated level of customer demand for various reasons the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

we also sell our products through various trade channels including traditional retail and ecommerce channels if we or our major customers are not successful in navigating the shifting consumer preferences to distribution channels such as ecommerce our expected future revenues may be negatively impacted 

if our products or solutions fail to meet certification and specification requirements are defective or otherwise fall short of endusers needs and expectations our business may be negatively impacted 

the security and access control product markets we serve often have unique certification and specification requirements reflecting local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs while we strive to meet all certification and specification requirements if any of our products or solutions do not meet such requirements or contain or are perceived to contain defects or otherwise fall short of endusers needs and expectations we may incur significant costs and our business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

additionally as endusers have continued to adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes accelerated by the increasing adoption of iot technologies our industry is seeing a shift in demand from mechanical security products to electronic security products and solutions including connected devices electronic security products and solutions are increasingly more sophisticated and technologically complex than the mechanical security products we sell and have an increased risk of design cybersecurity or manufacturing defects which could lead to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory or other assets and significant warranty and other expenses product quality issues can also adversely affect the enduser experience resulting in reputational harm loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and solutions delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales further adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales 

our business and innovation strategies include making acquisitions of and investments in external companies these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating and financial results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete acquisitions with suitable candidates in the future nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful or otherwise result in efficient integration and creation of synergies 

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable for these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations further there may be difficulties in evaluating potential acquisitions including the possibility that our due diligence may not reveal or fully assess valuation issues potential liabilities or other acquisition risks 

acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions also involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of managements time and attention from daily operations 

• difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business 

• difficulties completing the transaction in a timely manner 

• difficulties realizing synergies expected to result from acquisitions 

• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses 

• inability to obtain regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms 

• potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us 

• difficulties competing in the new markets we enter 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 

• dilution of interests of holders of our ordinary shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities and 

• difficulty in integrating financial reporting systems and implementing controls procedures and policies including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting appropriate for public companies of our size at companies that prior to the acquisition had lacked such controls procedures and policies 

further as part of our innovation strategy from time to time we invest in startup companies andor development stage technology or other companies in evaluating these opportunities we follow a structured evaluation process that considers factors such as potential financial returns new expertise in emerging technology and business benefits despite our best efforts to calculate potential return and risk some or all of the companies we invest in may be unprofitable at the time of and 

subsequent to our investment we may lose money in these investments including the potential for future impairment charges on the investments and the anticipated benefits of the technology and business relationships may be less than expected 

we continually look to expand our services and products into new international markets and as we do we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets in some instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of thirdparty and foreign business partners in such markets certain international markets may be slower than our established markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into certain new markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of endusers and businesses with dominant market shares any acquisitions or investments may ultimately not be successful may harm our business or financial condition andor result in impairment charges 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services we can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove successful among other negative effects our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital in the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

we may not be able to effectively manage and implement restructuring initiatives or other organizational changes 

we have from time to time restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market or product changes performance issues changes in strategy acquisitions andor other internal and external considerations these restructuring activities and other organizational changes often result in increased restructuring costs diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations and temporarily reduced productivity if we are unable to successfully manage and implement restructuring and other organizational changes we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these activities or do so within the expected timeframe these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other organizational changes and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

the effects of global climate change or other unexpected events including global health crises may disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our business 

the effects of global climate change such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects or the occurrence of unexpected events including wildfires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes floods tsunamis and other severe hazards or global health crises such as the outbreak of ebola or the global covid19 pandemic or other actual or threatened epidemic pandemic outbreak and spread of a communicable disease or virus in the countries where we operate or sell products and provide services could adversely affect our operations and financial performance extreme weather natural disasters power outages global health crises or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing causing physical damage and partial or complete closure of our manufacturing sites or distribution centers loss of human capital temporary or longterm disruption in the manufacturing and supply of products and services and disruption in our ability to deliver products and services to customers these events and disruptions could also adversely affect our customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition or ability to operate resulting in reduced customer demand delays in payments received or supply chain disruptions further these events and disruptions could increase insurance and other operating costs including impacting our decisions regarding construction of new facilities to select areas less prone to climate change risks and natural disasters which could result in indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain or other price modifications to our products and services 

in particular the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic pandemic or other global health crisis on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the duration and severity of such epidemic pandemic or other global health crisis actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems networks and services including hardware software firmware and technological applications and platforms collectively it systems to manage and operate our business from endtoend including ordering and managing materials from suppliers design and development manufacturing marketing selling and shipping to customers invoicing and billing managing our banking and cash liquidity systems managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements there can be no assurance that our current it systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our it systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that newly implemented it systems will improve our current systems improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new it systems may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented and maintained negatively impact our business if our it systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on thirdparty service providers for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to thirdparty service providers in order to achieve efficiencies if such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us 

despite our implementation of cybersecurity measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products including access solutions may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses malicious codes malware ransomware phishing social engineering denial of service hacking breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions the scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs further while we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and exclusions cover certain aspects of our cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover our losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

our daily business operations also require us to collect andor retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers employees suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the european unions general data protection regulation that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data the loss or breach of such data due to various causes including material security breaches catastrophic events extreme weather natural disasters power outages system failures computer viruses improper data handling programming errors unauthorized access and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

in addition we operate in an environment where there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws and regulations in effect or expected to go into effect in the future including regulations related to devices connected through iot in the 

various jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with such laws and regulations while ensuring our data is secure 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain a workforce with the skills necessary to develop manufacture and deliver the products and services desired by our customers we need highly skilled and qualified personnel in multiple areas including engineering sales manufacturing information technology cybersecurity business development strategy and management we must therefore continue to effectively recruit retain and motivate highly qualified skilled and diverse personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these employees for various reasons including intense competition for skilled employees labor shortages increased labor costs candidates’ preference to work remotely changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations or any government or public health mandates such as vaccine mandates that may result in workforce attrition and difficulty with recruiting may jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by our supplier partners may negatively impact our business 

we procure certain products including raw materials and other commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals as well as parts components including electronic components and logistical services from supplier partners located throughout the world our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays additionally because not all of our supply arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts and components may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are also subject to supply and pricing risks which could negatively impact our margin performance and results of operations 

if we are unable to effectively manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions shortages of materials labor electronic and other components capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations freight delays and other supply chain constraints and disruptions or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed 

economic market and financial risks 

increased prices and inflation could negatively impact our margin performance and our financial results 

increased inflation including rising prices for raw materials parts and components freight packaging labor and energy increases the costs to manufacture and distribute our products and services and we may be unable to pass these costs on to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against volatility in commodity prices however we utilize firm purchase commitments where possible to help mitigate risk the pricing of some materials parts and components we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in other costs such as packaging freight labor and energy prices if inflation in these costs increases beyond our ability to control for them through measures such as implementing operating efficiencies we 

may not be able to increase prices to sufficiently offset the effect of various cost increases without negatively impacting customer demand thereby negatively impacting our margin performance and results of operations 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia canada china europe korea mexico new zealand and the middle east the political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

• changes to trade agreements sanctions import and export regulations including imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas and customs duties 

• changes in applicable tax regulations and interpretations 

• economic downturns 

• social and political instability civil strife and other geographical uncertainty 

• changes in laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints in various jurisdictions 

• limitation of ownership rights including expropriation of assets by a local government and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings 

• sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries 

• difficulty in staffing and managing global operations 

• difficulty in enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems 

• political unrest national and international conflict including war border closures civil disturbances and terrorist acts and 

• difficulty in transporting materials components and products 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business in the us and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin reduce cash flows andor negatively impact our ability to compete 

our business relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

demand for our security products and solutions relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions including consumer confidence and disposable income corporate and government spending workfromhome trends availability of credit and demand for new housing and infrastructure weakness or instability in one or more of these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or cancel major capital projects or otherwise choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and solutions and erode average selling prices 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see part ii item 7a management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

approximately 30 of our 2021 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations we do not hedge against all our currency exposure and therefore our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets 

at december 31 2021 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 8038 million and 1139 million respectively pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to annually assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in addition interim assessments must be performed for these and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred significant disruptions to our business or end market conditions protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures or market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges to our goodwill indefinitelived intangible or other longlived assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods when recognized 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and longterm credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

we have approximately 145 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2021 in addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the 2021 revolving facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future a portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchases or future business opportunities 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in such event we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 

additionally at december 31 2021 our borrowings included a variable rate term loan facility the 2021 term facility and together with the 2021 revolving facility the 2021 credit facilities with an outstanding balance of 250 million which exposes us to variable interest rate risk we are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings under our 2021 revolving facility if variable base rates under our 2021 credit facilities increase in the future our interest expense could increase 

legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputational matters 

our reputation and the reputation of our brands including the perception held by our customers endusers business partners investors other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business are influenced by various factors there is an increased focus from our stakeholders on esg practices and disclosure – and if we fail or are perceived to have failed in any number of esg matters such as environmental stewardship inclusion and diversity workplace conduct and support for local communities or to effectively respond to changes in or new legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns our reputation or the reputation of our brands may suffer such damage to our reputation and the reputation of our brands may negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or our brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or the reputation of our brands if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about product quality safety corporate social responsibility or other matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental product liability antitrust intellectual property data protection privacy and labor and employment matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those products or services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by adverse publicity or improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and environmental health and safety standards we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations including climate change legislation or other environmental mandates could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see item 1 business – regulatory matters 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

as a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions 

since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations interpretations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed recommended or implemented changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act 2014 of ireland as amended which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 5 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always be approved if the directors authority to issue ordinary shares is not renewed then we may be limited in our ability to use our shares for example as consideration for acquisitions 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor our effective tax rate moreover other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor our effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders residing in the us will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our memorandum and articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contains provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

• a provision of our articles of association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder being i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares or ii an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares subject to certain exceptions 

• rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings 

• the right of our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances subject to applicable law and 

• the ability of our board of directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on our board of directors 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company

recent developments 

covid19 pandemic and industry trends and outlook 

the covid19 pandemic and uneven economic recovery continue to create volatility in the global economy and on our business throughout 2021 we experienced strong and accelerating demand for our products and services in most of the markets we serve however especially in the second half of the year we also experienced an acceleration of several macroeconomic challenges that have negatively impacted our ability to meet this robust demand such as supply chain disruptions and delays shortages in materials including reductions in allocations of electronic components and other parts from key suppliers labor shortages and elevated levels of employee absenteeism due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and increased commodity material component packaging freight and labor inflation these challenges have also created both operational and logistical inefficiencies which have led to periodic production interruptions and an increased level of inventory which have negatively impacted our productivity margin performance working capital and cash flows while these challenges are impacting all our global businesses they had a more pronounced impact on our allegion americas operating segment in 2021 

we currently anticipate these challenges to continue in 2022 and are rapidly adapting to navigate them expecting to be wellpositioned to convert demand to revenue as conditions normalize we remain focused on providing exceptional service to our customers implementing measures to mitigate operational and distribution inefficiencies and reduce our record high level of backlogs such as aligning resources to reengineer product designs and configurations to accept alternate electronic components and developing alternate sources of supply implementing pricing initiatives to address rising production material freight and labor costs and investing in business initiatives to drive future growth we will continue to explore various options to control costs and enhance financial performance while minimizing disruption to customers and the overall business however the full impacts of the pandemic and the ongoing macroeconomic challenges on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows remain uncertain 

the pandemic and related macroeconomic challenges noted above will likely continue to impact us in numerous and evolving ways that we may not be able to accurately predict the full impact of the pandemic will continue to depend on future developments such as the continued spread and duration of the pandemic the emergence of future variant strains of the covid19 virus which may be more contagious or severe the availability and distribution of effective medical treatments and vaccines vaccination rates as well as any governmentimposed restrictions or mandates further any new or strengthened governmentimposed restrictions or mandates on the conduct of business and travel could adversely impact our ability to carry out business as usual in certain markets 

the challenges and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as other challenges and uncertainties that could affect our businesses are described further under part i item 1a risk factors

qmi divestiture 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 the net assets of our qatar metal industries qmi business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and accordingly were written down to fair value resulting in a loss on assets held for sale of 379 million 

on february 28 2021 we completed our divestiture of qmi the impacts of this divestiture on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 are reflected in the discussions below 

2020 impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic we performed interim impairment tests on the goodwill balances of our former emea and asia pacific reporting units as well as on certain indefinitelived trade name assets in these two regions during the first quarter of 2020 the results of these interim impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair value of our former asia pacific reporting unit and three indefinitelived trade names were impaired consequently goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling 963 million were recorded during the first quarter of 2020 further intangible asset impairment charges of 54 million were recorded in 2020 in our former asia pacific segment relating to supply chain disruptions that reduced a brands expected future cash flows and declines in volumes and pricing pressure for a separate subsidiary in the region 

2021 dividends and share repurchases 

we paid quarterly dividends of 036 per ordinary share to shareholders on record as of march 17 2021 june 16 2021 september 16 2021 and december 20 2021 we paid a total of 1290 million in cash for dividends to ordinary shareholders and repurchased approximately 33 million shares for approximately 4128 million during the year ended december 31 2021 

results of operations  for the years ended december 31 



the discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in our results of operations for the years presented and form the basis used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the business for a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our 2020 annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february 16 2021 

net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 54 or 1475 million compared to the same period in 2020 due to the following 



the increase in net revenues was principally driven by higher volumes improved pricing and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements these increases were slightly offset by the divestiture of our qmi business in february 2021 the increase in sales volumes for the year was principally realized during the second quarter given the muted demand and temporary plant shutdowns we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic however in addition to the comparative impact of the rebound in demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 the supply chain disruptions and delays and shortages in materials components and labor discussed above resulted in lower volumes during the second half of 2021 within the allegion americas segment while these challenges are expected to continue into 2022 given the current elevated demand we are experiencing we expect volume growth to resume as conditions improve 

pricing includes increases or decreases of price including discounts surcharges andor other sales deductions on our existing products and services volume includes increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume of existing products and services as well as new products and services 

cost of goods sold 

for the year ended december 31 2021 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues increased to 580 from 567 due to the following 



cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to inflation in excess of pricing and productivity improvements and to a lesser extent unfavorable product mix which exceeded the benefits from sales volume growth during the year inflation in excess of pricing and productivity reflects the impacts of increased commodity material component packaging freight and labor inflation as well as inefficiencies caused by the global supply chain challenges and shortages of materials components and labor as discussed above these increases were partially offset by the yearoveryear decrease in restructuring and acquisition expenses favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impact of our qmi divestiture 

inflation in excess of pricing and productivity includes the impact to costs of goods sold from pricing as defined above in addition to productivity and inflation productivity represents improvements in unit costs of materials and cost reductions related to improvements to our manufacturing design and processes inflation includes unit costs for the current period compared to the average actual cost for the prior period multiplied by current year volumes 

volumeproduct mix represents the impact due to increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume including new products and services including the effect of changes in the mix of products and services sold on cost of goods sold 

selling and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2021 selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 235 from 234 due to the following 



selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased primarily due to inflation in excess of productivity and increased investment spending these increases were partially offset by favorable volume leverage a yearoveryear decrease in restructuring and acquisition expenses and the beneficial impact of our qmi divestiture on current year operations inflation in excess of productivity reflects increases to variable compensation and a return to a more normalized level of other discretionary business spending that was reduced or delayed in the prior year as a result of the covid19 pandemic the increased investment spending similarly reflects a return to a fullyear focus of investing in business initiatives to drive future growth and realize our vision of seamless access with a focus on software and connected products the increase also reflects that certain of these investments were temporarily frozen or delayed in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic 

volume leverage represents the contribution margin related to changes in sales volume excluding the impact of price productivity mix and inflation expenses related to increased head count for strategic initiatives new facilities or significant spending for strategic initiatives or new product and channel development are captured in investment spending in the table above 

operating incomemargin 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 1267 million from the same period in 2020 and operating margin increased to 185 from 148 due to the following 



the increase in operating income was primarily due to the prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the loss on assets held for sale related to our qmi business which did not recur in the current year also contributing to the increase in operating income were favorable volumeproduct mix lower yearoveryear restructuring and acquisition expenses favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impact of our qmi divestiture on current year operations these increases were partially offset by inflation in excess of pricing and productivity and increased investment spending as discussed above inflation in excess of pricing and productivity reflects the impacts of increased commodity material component packaging freight and labor inflation inefficiencies caused by the global supply chain challenges and shortages of materials components and labor as well as increases in variable compensation and other discretionary business spending to a more normalized level in the current year similarly the increased investment spending reflects a return to a fullyear focus of investing in business initiatives to drive future growth and realize our vision of seamless access with a focus on software and connected products the increase also reflects that certain of these investments were temporarily frozen or delayed in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic 

the increase in operating margin was also primarily due to the prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the loss on assets held for sale related to our qmi business which did not recur in the current year also contributing to the increase in operating margin were lower yearoveryear restructuring and acquisition expenses favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impact of our qmi divestiture on current year operations these increases were partially offset by inflation in excess of pricing and productivity and increased investment spending as discussed above as well as unfavorable product mix which exceeded the margin benefits from the sales volume growth during the year 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased 09 million compared to 2020 primarily due to a lower weightedaverage interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness 

other income net 

the components of other income net for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2021 other income net increased 310 million compared to 2020 primarily due to a 207 million gain in the fourth quarter related to a fair value remeasurement of our investment in vergesense inc this gain is included within other in the table above also contributing to the increase in other income net are an increase in other realized and unrealized investment gains during the year favorable net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income less service cost and a gain of 64 million from the sale of our equity method investment in nuki home solutions gmbh which is included in earnings and gains from the sale of equity method investments net in the table above these increases are partially 

offset by gains of 128 million in the prior year which did not recur in 2021 related to the reclassification to earnings of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments upon the liquidation of two legal entities in our former emea region and which are included within other in the table above 

provision for income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2021 our effective tax rate was 78 compared to 139 for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact recognized in 2020 related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions and the unfavorable tax impact recognized in 2020 related to the recording of valuation allowances which were partially offset by an unfavorable yearoveryear change in sharebased compensation deductions and an unfavorable mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions 

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for two segments allegion americas and allegion international these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews our financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income loss as a percentage of the segments net revenues 

the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in net earnings as previously announced effective january 1 2021 we combined our previous operations in emea and asia pacific into a new segment named allegion international in addition to renaming our americas segment allegion americas business segment information for emea and asia pacific for the year ended december 31 2020 has been combined in the segment results of operations presented below to reflect this change in reportable segments 

segment results of operations  for the years ended december 31 



allegion americas 

our allegion americas segment is a leading provider of security products and solutions throughout north america central america the caribbean and south america the segment sells a broad range of products and solutions including locks locksets portable locks key systems door closers exit devices doors and door systems electronic products and access control systems to endusers in commercial institutional and residential facilities including the education healthcare government hospitality commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets this segment’s primary brands are lcn schlage steelcraft technical glass products tgp and von duprin 

net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 28 or 555 million compared to the same period in 2020 due to the following   



the increase in net revenues was principally driven by higher volumes improved pricing and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements the increase in sales volumes for the year was principally realized during the second quarter given the muted demand and temporary plant shutdowns we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic however the supply chain disruptions and delays and shortages in materials components and labor discussed above have resulted in lower volumes during the second half of 2021 while these challenges are expected to continue into 2022 given the current elevated demand we are experiencing we expect volume growth to resume as conditions improve 

net revenues from nonresidential products were flat compared to the same period in the prior year while we continue to see strong demand for our nonresidential products the persistent and widespread supply chain challenges and shortages in materials components including electronic components and labor discussed above have led to challenges in converting this elevated demand into net revenues further the combination of these factors has also culminated in our highest nonresidential product backlog to date as a company as of december 31 2021 

net revenues from residential products increased by a low double digits percent compared to the prior year driven significantly by the muted demand and temporary plant shutdowns we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic while we continue to see strong demand for our residential products due to a sustained level of diy home projects and a robust residential housing construction market we also experienced supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages in the second half of 2021 which we expect to continue through 2022 

additionally growth in electronic security products and solutions has become an increased metric monitored by management and a focus of our investors electronic products encompass both residential and nonresidential products and include all electrified product categories including but not limited to electronic and electrified locks access controls and electrified exit devices net revenues from the sale of electronic products decreased by a low single digits percent compared to 2020 as previously disclosed a surge in global demand for electronic components has led to supply chain challenges and component shortages this has led to a reduction in the allocations of electronic components we receive from key suppliers periodic production interruptions and delays in our ability to meet the elevated level of demand for our electronic products in the second half of 2021 while considered temporary we expect these challenges around the availability of electronic components to continue through 2022 as a result we are actively implementing measures to mitigate the operational and distribution inefficiencies these component shortages and other challenges are creating such as reengineering product designs and configurations and developing alternate sources of component supply 

operating incomemargin 

segment operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased 552 million and segment operating margin decreased to 253 from 288 compared to the same period in 2020 due to the following 



the decreases in segment operating income and segment operating margin were primarily due to inflation in excess of pricing and productivity unfavorable product mix which exceeded the benefits from sales volume growth during the year and increased investment spending these decreases were partially offset by a yearoveryear decrease in restructuring and acquisition expenses and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements inflation in excess of pricing and productivity reflects the impacts of the increased commodity material component packaging freight and labor inflation inefficiencies caused by the global supply chain challenges and shortages of materials components and labor discussed above as well as increases in variable compensation and other discretionary business spending to a more normalized level in the current year similarly the increased investment spending reflects a return to a fullyear focus of investing in business initiatives to drive future growth and realize our vision of seamless access with a focus on software and connected products the increase also reflects that certain of these investments were temporarily frozen or delayed in 2020 due to the economic uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic 

allegion international 

our allegion international segment provides security products services and solutions primarily throughout europe asia and oceania the segment offers endusers a broad range of products services and solutions including locks locksets portable locks key systems door closers exit devices doors and door systems electronic products and access control systems as well as time and attendance and workforce productivity solutions this segment’s primary brands are axa bricard briton cisa gainsborough interflex and simonsvoss 

net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 131 or 920 million compared to the same period in 2020 due to the following 



the increase in net revenues was principally driven by higher volumes and foreign currency exchange rate movements in addition to improved pricing and were partially offset by the divestiture of our qmi business in february 2021 the higher volumes led by our global portable security businesses were achieved across nearly all of the countries within our allegion international segment reflecting in part the global economic rebound in 2021 contrasted with the depressed demand and temporary plant shutdowns we experienced in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

operating income lossmargin 

segment operating income loss for the year ended december 31 2021 was favorable 1845 million and segment operating margin improved to 104 from 145 compared to the same period in 2020 due to the following 



the improvements in segment operating income loss and segment operating margin were primarily due to the prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the loss on assets held for sale related to our qmi business which did not recur in the current year additional improvements were due to favorable volumeproduct mix a yearoveryear decrease in 

restructuring and acquisition expenses favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and the beneficial impacts of our current year acquisition and divestiture in the allegion international segment these increases were partially offset by inflation in excess of pricing and productivity and increased investment spending 

additionally while our allegion international segment did not experience the supply chain disruptions and delays and other operational and logistical challenges to the same extent as our allegion americas segment in 2021 these challenges have increased during the fourth quarter of 2021 and we currently expect them to continue into 2022 

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of liquidity 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 for additional details see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was nearly flat compared to 2020 decreasing by 17 million as increased net earnings were offset by working capital challenges principally stemming from the supply chain disruptions and delays and related operational and logistical interruptions discussed above 

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 decreased 251 million compared to 2020 primarily due to cash proceeds from the sales of our equity method investment in nuki home solutions gmbh and other investments as well as a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions 

financing activities  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 2074 million compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase of 2040 million in cash used to repurchase shares 

capitalization 

at december 31 longterm debt and other borrowings consisted of the following 



in november 2021 we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement the “2021 credit agreement” which refinanced in full our previously outstanding unsecured credit facilities the 2021 credit agreement consists of a 2500 million term loan facility the “2021 term facility” and a 5000 million revolving credit facility the “2021 revolving facility” and together with the 2021 term facility the “2021 credit facilities” the 2021 credit facilities mature on november 18 2026 the initial proceeds from the 2021 term facility of 2500 million were used primarily to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding unsecured term facility all obligations under the previously outstanding credit agreement were 

satisfied all commitments thereunder were terminated and all guarantees that had been granted in connection therewith were released 

the 2021 term facility will amortize in quarterly installments at the following rates 125 per quarter starting march 31 2022 through march 31 2025 25 per quarter starting june 30 2025 through september 30 2026 with the balance due on november 18 2026 any amounts outstanding under the 2021 term facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time without premium or penalty subject to customary breakage costs amounts borrowed under the 2021 term facility that are repaid may not be reborrowed 

the 2021 revolving facility provides aggregate commitments of up to 5000 million which includes up to 1000 million for the issuance of letters of credit at december 31 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2021 revolving facility and we had 87 million of letters of credit outstanding commitments under the 2021 revolving facility may be reduced at any time without premium or penalty and amounts repaid may be reborrowed certain fees are owed with respect to the 2021 revolving facility including an unused commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2021 revolving facility of between 0090 and 0200 per year depending on our credit rating as well as certain other fees 

outstanding borrowings under the 2021 credit facilities accrue interest at our option of i a bloomberg shortterm bank yield index “bsby” rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 0875 to 1375 depending on our credit ratings at december 31 2021 the outstanding borrowings under the 2021 term facility accrue interest at bsby plus a margin of 1125 resulting in an interest rate of 1271 the 2021 credit facilities also contain negative and affirmative covenants and events of default that among other things limit or restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions in addition the 2021 credit facilities require us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio as defined within the agreement as of december 31 2021 our leverage ratio of approximately 18 was significantly below the covenant requirement and we do not anticipate any potential covenant concerns for at least the next 12 months 

as of december 31 2021 we also have 4000 million outstanding of 3200 senior notes due 2024 the 3200 senior notes 4000 million outstanding of 3550 senior notes due 2027 the 3550 senior notes and 4000 million outstanding of 3500 senior notes due 2029 the 3500 senior notes and all three senior notes collectively the senior notes the senior notes require semiannual interest payments on april 1 and october 1 of each year and will mature on october 1 2024 october 1 2027 and october 1 2029 respectively 

historically the majority of our earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations at december 31 2021 we analyzed our working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain subsidiaries made distributions and concluded that no material changes to our historic permanent reinvestment assertions are required 

scheduled principal repayments on indebtedness as of december 31 2021 can be found in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements expected principal and interest payments related to our longterm indebtedness in 2022 amount to 126 million and 450 million respectively given our current level of indebtedness and effective interest rates as of december 31 2021 

liquidity outlook 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development and fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements our ability to generate cash from our operating activities our unused availability under our 2021 revolving facility and our access to the capital and credit markets enable us to fund these capital needs as well as execute our longterm growth strategies and return value to our shareholders as of december 31 2021 we maintain cash and cash equivalents of 3979 million and have unused availability of 4913 million under our 2021 revolving facility further our business operates with strong operating cash flows low leverage and low capital intensity providing financial flexibility including sufficient access to credit markets 

shortterm financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements restructuring initiatives capital spending dividend payments and principal and interest payments on our longterm debt longterm financing needs depend largely on potential growth opportunities including potential acquisitions repayment or refinancing of our longterm obligations and repurchases of our ordinary shares based upon our operations existing cash balances and availability under our 2021 credit facilities we expect cash flows from operations to be sufficient to maintain a sound financial position and liquidity and to meet our financing needs for at least the next 12 months further we do not anticipate any covenant compliance challenges with any of our outstanding indebtedness for at least the next 12 months we also believe the availability under our 2021 credit facilities and access to credit and capital markets are sufficient to achieve our longerterm strategic plans 

contractual obligations and other commitments 

in addition to the scheduled principal and interest payments discussed above our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

purchase commitments – we occasionally enter into shortterm firm purchase commitments to mitigate pricing risk related to certain of our commodity parts and component purchases which represent commitments under enforceable and legally binding agreements such purchase commitments are made in the normal course of business and are not anticipated to materially impact our liquidity or financial position over the next 12 months 

leases – we have numerous real estate and equipment leasing arrangements for which we are a lessee see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information as to the short and longterm lease liabilities included within the consolidated balance sheets as well as future minimum lease payments for 2022 and future years 

defined benefit plans – our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status asset allocation and the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans regularly in addition to investment manager performance none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to volatility in the markets 

at december 31 2021 we had net pension assets of 229 million which consist of plan assets of 7759 million and benefit obligations of 7530 million it is our objective to contribute to our pension plans in order to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required at december 31 2021 the funded status of our us pension plans increased to 972 from 921 at december 31 2020 the funded status for our nonus pension plans increased to 1077 at december 31 2021 from 1018 at december 31 2020 the funded status for all of our pension plans at december 31 2021 increased to 1030 from 975 at december 31 2020 while there are no required pension contributions for 2022 we currently expect to contribute approximately 5 million to our plans worldwide in 2022 for further details on pension plan activity see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes – at december 31 2021 we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of 415 million and 75 million of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax although we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing over which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities – we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

• goodwill – goodwill is tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and starts with a comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair values is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market multiple of earnings market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on our estimates of revenue growth rates margin assumptions and discount rates to estimate future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing with due consideration given to forecasting risk these assumptions are subject to varying degrees of judgment and complexity estimates of future revenue growth rates and margin assumptions represent our best estimates of future cash flows given our expectations of market growth for the security products industry in the specific markets in which we operate as well as factors such as our market positioning brand strength pricing and marketing efforts and other growth and productivity opportunities and initiatives discount rate assumptions represent our best estimates of market participant adjusted weightedaverage costs of capital although these assumptions represent our best estimates as of the assessment date certain factors could potentially create variances in these estimates including but not limited to 

• decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater than expected declines in volumes pricing pressures or disruptive technology 

• declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition or an inability to develop or launch new products 

• the impacts of market volatility including but not limited to impacts of global pandemics greater than expected inflation supply chain disruption and delays declines in pricing reductions in volumes or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

• the level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts including those related to acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products and 

• volatility in market interest rates that could impact the selection of an appropriate discount rate 

the market approach requires determining an appropriate peer group which is utilized to derive estimated fair values of our reporting units based on selected market multiples the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the selected peer group companies and the subject reporting units while market multiples are based on observable arm’slength evidence of value these assumptions are still subject to inherent uncertainty as the peergroup companies may differ in significant ways from one or more of our reporting units in terms of size growth or business description characteristics 

all critical accounting estimates and assumptions utilized in determining the fair values of our reporting units are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity while we make every effort to estimate fair value as accurately as possible with the information available at the assessment date changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods 

• indefinitelived intangible assets – similar to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than its carrying amount recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess a significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinitelived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values 

• income taxes – we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating losses and nonus tax credits to the extent that realizing these benefits is 

considered in our judgment to be more likely than not we regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability projected future taxable income timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies where appropriate we record a valuation allowance with respect to future tax benefits we establish valuation allowances against the realizability of any deferred tax assets based on our consideration of all available evidence both positive and negative using a “more likely than not” standard this assessment considers the nature frequency and amount of recent losses the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies in making such judgments significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a tax authority with respect to that return we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters and will adjust our estimates if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period the matter is finally resolved 

• defined benefit plans – we provide several us and nonus defined benefit pension plan benefits to eligible employees and retirees our noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering noncollectively bargained us employees provide benefits on an average pay formula while most plans for collectively bargained us employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula the nonus pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service determining the costs associated with such plans is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected returns on plan assets employee mortality and turnover rates actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with gaap actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions and when they do are generally recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into earnings over future periods 

we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions as appropriate the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the expected return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation we believe the assumptions utilized in recording our defined benefit obligations are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension benefit cost an estimated 025 rate decline in the discount rate would have increased net periodic pension benefit cost by approximately 12 million in 2021 while a 025 rate decline in the estimated return on assets would have increased net periodic pension benefit cost by approximately 19 million 

• business combinations – the fair value of consideration paid in a business combination is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and goodwill acquired intangible assets primarily include indefinitelived trade names customer relationships and completed technologies the accounting for business combinations involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimation including the fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the acquired assets as a result in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a thirdparty valuation specialist in estimating fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities an income approach or market approach or both is utilized in accordance with accepted valuation models to determine fair value the assumptions used to determine the fair value of acquired assets include projections developed using historical information and internal forecasts available industry and market data estimates of longterm growth rates profitability customer attrition and royalty rates which are estimated at the time of acquisition considering the perspective of marketplace participants while we believe expectations and assumptions utilized for historical business combinations have been reasonable they are inherently uncertain and unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances occasionally do occur and may occur in the future which could affect the 

accuracy and validity of such assumptions the impact of future business combinations on our financial condition or results of operations may also be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates in addition to events and circumstances subsequent to the acquisition that are not reasonably anticipated when finalizing our purchase accounting estimates and assumptions 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 herein for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2021 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 94 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2021 

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our 2021 credit facilities accrue interest at our option of i a bsby rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 0875 to 1375 depending on our credit ratings at december 31 2021 the outstanding borrowings of 2500 million under the 2021 term facility accrue interest at bsby plus a margin of 1125 we are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings as we currently have unused availability of 4913 million under our 2021 revolving facility as of december 31 2021 if our bsby or other applicable base rates of our 2021 credit facilities increase in the future our interest expense could increase

history and developments 

we were incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of what was then ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 we became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 100 years ago and many originally created their categories 

• von duprin established in 1908 was awarded the first exit device patent

regulatory matters 

we are subject to a variety of federal state and local laws and regulations both within and outside the us relating to environmental health and safety concerns we are committed to conducting our business in a safe environmentally responsible and sustainable manner in compliance with all applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations and in a manner that helps promote and protect the health and safety of our environment associates customers contractors and members of our local communities worldwide we operate with principles that support our proactive commitments including 

• integrating sound environmental health safety ehs and sustainability strategies in all elements of our business functions including objectives and measurements 

• conducting periodic formal evaluation of our compliance status and annual review of objectives and targets 

• creating a workplace culture where all employees are responsible for safety 

• making continuous improvements in ehs and sustainability management systems and performance including the reduction in the usage of natural resources waste minimization prevention of pollution and prevention of workplace accidents injuries and risks 

• designing operating and maintaining our facilities in a manner that minimizes negative ehs and sustainability impacts 

• using materials responsibly including where feasible the recycling and reuse of materials and 

• acting in a way that shows sensitivity to community concerns about ehs and sustainability issues 

we recognize that these principles are critical to our future success we have a dedicated environmental program designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate any identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities we also regularly evaluate our remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have from time to time received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes in this form 10k quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors 

strategic and operational risks 

our normal business operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the global covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 outbreak which was declared by the who as a pandemic in march 2020 and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate this pandemic have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in various regions around the world this pandemic has also caused and may continue to cause disruption to our global supply chain and business operations in addition to the various effects noted elsewhere within the risk factors contained in this annual report on form 10k actions taken to help limit the spread of covid19 such as general public health decrees or other government mandates to restrict business activities and travel avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability to carry out business as usual including the temporary suspension of some of our operations shortages in materials reduction in customer demand increased absenteeism costs associated with operational changes and an extended period of remote work arrangements for some of our employees which could increase cybersecurity risks and other operational risks conversely as governments ease their restrictions and social interactions increase prior to the development and distribution of an effective vaccine or treatments for covid19 preventative and precautionary measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of increased infection and could result in increased illness among our employees business partners and others and lead to further business interruption in addition a significant number of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic while we cannot predict the impact that this pandemic will continue to have on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions any material adverse effects on these parties could adversely impact us 

the global economic uncertainty due to this pandemic has also negatively impacted and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for example this pandemic has led to changes in commercial real estate occupancy increases in workfromhome arrangements constraints on government and institutional budgets and an uncertain business climate which have all contributed to declines and delays in new construction and renovation activity during 2020 including in many of the commercial and institutional construction markets we serve these challenges may be significant and continue beyond the covid19 pandemic and the rate and sustainability of future growth remains uncertain as the longterm impacts of the pandemic and related market disruption are not yet known 

additionally as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic interim impairment tests were performed on select goodwill and indefinitelived trade name assets in the first quarter of 2020 resulting in impairment charges of approximately 963 million if the ongoing economic impact of the covid19 pandemic proves to be more severe than estimated the economic recovery takes longer to materialize or does not materialize as strongly as anticipated this could result in further impairment charges in the future 

despite our efforts to manage and mitigate these impacts to the company their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of this pandemic thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects the development distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate impact on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict the continued spread of covid19 may have further adverse impacts on our business operations customer demand supply chain cash flow generation financial position and liquidity and may also exacerbate other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form 10k further our management is focused on mitigating the impacts of covid19 which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources which may divert attention and resources from other business matters

increased competition including from technological developments could adversely affect our business 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational regional and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise effective channels to market breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases further in a number of our product offerings we compete with our retail customers and technology partners who use their own private labels if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives including increased competition from private label brands the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical electronic and digital products technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape our success depends in part upon the research development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete the continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services that meet the varied and evolving needs of our customers and endusers in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer and consumer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

we also sell our products through various trade channels including traditional retail and ecommerce channels if we or our major customers are not successful in navigating the shifting consumer preferences to distribution channels such as ecommerce our expected future revenues may be negatively impacted 

if our products or solutions fail to meet certification and specification requirements are defective or otherwise fall short of endusers needs and expectations our business may be negatively impacted 

the security and access control product markets we serve often have unique certification and specification requirements reflecting local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs while we strive to meet all certification and specification requirements if any of our products or solutions do not meet such requirements or contain or are perceived to contain defects or otherwise fall short of endusers needs and expectations we may incur significant costs and our business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted 

additionally as endusers have continued to adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes accelerated by the increasing adoption of iot technologies growth in sales of electronic security products and solutions are expected to outperform growth in sales of mechanical security products electronic security products and solutions are increasingly more sophisticated and technologically complex than the mechanical security products we sell and have an increased risk of design or manufacturing defects which could lead to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs 

table of contents 

of inventory or other assets and significant warranty and other expenses product quality issues can also adversely affect the enduser experience resulting in reputational harm loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and solutions delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales further adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales 

our business and innovation strategies include making acquisitions of and investments in external companies these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating and financial results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete acquisitions with suitable candidates in the future nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful including efficient integration and creation of synergies 

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable for these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions also involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of managements time and attention from daily operations 

• difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business 

• difficulties completing the transaction in a timely manner 

• difficulties realizing synergies expected to result from acquisitions 

• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses 

• inability to obtain regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms 

• potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us 

• difficulties competing in the new markets we enter 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 

• dilution of interests of holders of our ordinary shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities and 

• difficulty in integrating financial reporting systems and implementing controls procedures and policies including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting appropriate for public companies of our size at companies that prior to the acquisition had lacked such controls procedures and policies 

further as part of our innovation strategy from time to time we invest in startup companies andor development stage technology or other companies in evaluating these opportunities we follow a structured evaluation process that considers factors such as potential financial returns new expertise in emerging technology and business benefits despite our best efforts to calculate potential return and risk some or all of these companies we invest in may be unprofitable at the time of and subsequent to our investment we may lose money in these investments including the potential for future impairment charges on the investments and the anticipated benefits of the technology and business relationships may be less than expected 

we continually look to expand our services and products into new international markets and as we do we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets in some instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of thirdparty and foreign business partners in such markets certain international markets may be slower than our established markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into certain new markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of endusers and businesses with dominant market shares any acquisitions or investments may ultimately not be successful may harm our business or financial condition andor result in impairment charges 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services we can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove successful among other negative effects 

table of contents 

our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital in the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

we may not be able to effectively manage and implement restructuring initiatives or other organizational changes 

we have from time to time restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market or product changes performance issues changes in strategy acquisitions andor other internal and external considerations for example we recently announced that effective january 1 2021 our emea and asia pacific operating segments would be combined to form the new allegion international segment these restructuring activities and other organizational changes often result in increased restructuring costs diversion of management’s time and attention from daily operations and temporarily reduced productivity if we are unable to successfully manage and implement these and other organizational changes we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these activities or do so within the expected timeframe these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other organizational changes and our net revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected 

disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by supplier partners may negatively impact our business 

our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

we procure certain products components and logistical services from supplier partners located throughout the world our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays if we are unable to effectively manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed 

the effects of global climate change or other unexpected events including global health crises may disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our business 

the effects of global climate change such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects or the occurrence of unexpected events including wildfires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes floods tsunamis and other severe hazards or global health crises such as the outbreak of ebola or the global covid19 pandemic or other actual or threatened epidemic pandemic outbreak and spread of a communicable disease or virus in the countries where we operate or sell products and provide services could adversely affect our operations and financial performance extreme weather natural disasters power outages global health crises or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing causing physical damage and partial or complete closure of our manufacturing sites or distribution centers loss of human capital temporary or longterm disruption in the manufacturing and supply of products and services and disruption in our ability to deliver products and services to customers these events and disruptions could also adversely affect our customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition or ability to operate resulting in reduced customer demand delays in payments received or supply chain disruptions further these events and disruptions could increase insurance and other operating costs including impacting our decisions regarding construction of new facilities to select areas less prone to climate change risks and natural disasters which could result in indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain or other price modifications to our products and services 

in particular the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic pandemic or other global health crisis on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

table of contents 

including new information that may emerge concerning the duration and severity of such epidemic pandemic or other global health crisis actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems networks and services including hardware software firmware and technological applications and platforms collectively it systems to manage and operate our business from endtoend including ordering and managing materials from suppliers design and development manufacturing marketing selling and shipping to customers invoicing and billing managing our banking and cash liquidity systems managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements there can be no assurance that our current it systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our it systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that any newly implemented it systems will improve our current systems improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new it systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented and maintained negatively impact our business if our it systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on thirdparty vendors for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to thirdparty service providers in order to achieve efficiencies if such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us 

despite our implementation of cybersecurity measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products including access solutions may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses malicious codes malware ransomware phishing social engineering denial of service hacking breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions the scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs 

our daily business operations also require us to collect andor retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers employees suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the european unions general data protection regulation that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data the loss or breach of such data due to various causes including material security breaches catastrophic events extreme weather natural disasters power outages system failures computer viruses improper data handling programming errors unauthorized access and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

in addition we operate in an environment where there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws and regulations in effect or expected to go into effect in the future including regulations related to devices connected through iot in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with such laws and regulations while ensuring our data is secure 

table of contents 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on the contributions and abilities of our employees and key management including for example the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to effectively recruit retain and motivate key management sales and other highly qualified skilled and diverse personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees for various reasons including changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

economic market and financial risks 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia canada china europe korea mexico new zealand and the middle east the political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

• changes to trade agreements sanctions import and export regulations including imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas and customs duties 

• changes in applicable tax regulations and interpretations 

• economic downturns and social and political instability 

• changes in laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints in various jurisdictions 

• limitation of ownership rights including expropriation of assets by a local government and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings 

• sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries 

• difficulty in staffing and managing global operations 

• difficulty in enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonus legal systems and 

• political unrest national and international conflict including war border closures civil disturbances and terrorist acts 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business in the us and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin reduce cash flow and negatively impact our ability to compete 

our business relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

demand for our security products and solutions relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions including consumer confidence and disposable income corporate and government spending workfromhome trends availability of credit and demand for new housing and infrastructure weakness or instability in one or more of these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or cancel major capital projects or otherwise choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and solutions and erode average selling prices 

table of contents 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

approximately 30 of our 2020 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure and therefore our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

commodity shortages price increases and higher energy prices could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to our customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising energy prices and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets 

at december 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 8190 million and 1183 million respectively pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we are required to annually assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment in addition interim assessments must be performed for these and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred significant disruptions to our business or end market conditions protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures or market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges to our goodwill indefinitelived intangible or other longlived assets specifically an unanticipated deterioration in net revenues andor operating margins generated by our newly created allegion international segment could trigger future impairments any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods when recognized 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and longterm credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent 

table of contents 

customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

we have approximately 14 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2020 in addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future a portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchases or future business opportunities 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in such event we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 

additionally at december 31 2020 our borrowings included a variable rate term loan facility indexed to libor the term facility and together with the revolving facility the credit facilities with an outstanding balance of 2388 million which exposes us to variable interest rate risk we are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings under our revolving facility if libor or other applicable base rates under our credit facilities increase in the future our interest expense could increase additionally the regulator that oversees libor has announced that it cannot guarantee libors availability after 2021 in the event libor is discontinued replaced significantly changed or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of our applicable interest rate or required payment amounts for our credit facilities this could also require different hedging strategies and require renegotiation of our existing credit facilities while we do not currently anticipate the transition from libor and the risks thereto to have a material adverse effect on us it remains uncertain at this time 

legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputational matters 

our reputation and the reputation of our brands including the perception held by our customers endusers business partners investors other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business are influenced by various factors there is an increased focus from our stakeholders on environmental social and governance esg practices and disclosure – and if we fail or are perceived to have failed in any number of esg matters such as environmental stewardship inclusion and diversity workplace conduct and support for local communities our reputation or the reputation of our brands may suffer such damage to our reputation and the reputation of our brands may negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the company or our brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or the reputation of our brands if we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about product quality safety corporate social responsibility or other matters sentiments toward the company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

table of contents 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental product liability antitrust intellectual property data protection privacy and labor and employment matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those products or services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by adverse publicity or improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and environmental health and safety standards we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see item 1 business  regulatory matters 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future 

table of contents 

releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

as a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions 

since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations interpretations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed recommended or implemented changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act 2014 of ireland as amended which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 5 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always 

table of contents 

be approved if the directors authority to issue ordinary shares is not renewed then we may be limited in our ability to use our shares for example as consideration for acquisitions 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor our effective tax rate moreover other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor our effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders residing in the us will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our memorandum and articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contains provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

• a provision of our articles of association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder being i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares or ii an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares subject to certain exceptions 

• rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings 

• the right of our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances subject to applicable law and 

• the ability of our board of directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on our board of directors 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors 

table of contents 

determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company

recent developments 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 a global pandemic was declared by the who related to covid19 the impacts of the covid19 pandemic negatively affected the global economy disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets the outbreak and spread of covid19 also resulted in a substantial curtailment of business activities worldwide including the major geographic markets we serve as part of the efforts to contain the spread of covid19 federal state and local governments have imposed various restrictions on the conduct of business and travel such as stayathome orders travel restrictions and quarantines these measures as well as changes in employee health and safety concerns and consumer spending patterns trends and preferences have led to widespread business closures and lower demand for our products with the most pronounced negative impacts of these measures on our results of operations occurring during the second quarter of 2020 further changes in commercial real estate occupancy constraints on government and institutional budgets and the uncertain business climate have led to declines and delays in new construction activity and discretionary projects including in many of the commercial and institutional construction markets we serve 

as the pandemic and resulting economic challenges have adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact us we continue to closely monitor their effects on all aspects of our business and the markets in which we operate throughout the pandemic our primary focus has been and continues to be the health and safety of employees our business continuity plan meeting the evolving needs of our customers and the wellbeing of the many communities around the world in which we operate during the early months of the pandemic we experienced temporary production shutdowns due either to government mandate or to help ensure employee safety most notably in italy and the baja region of mexico however the vast majority of our manufacturing facilities have remained open and operational throughout 2020 in part due to the numerous health and safety measures we adopted to promote the health and safety of our workforce and because many of our global operations have been deemed essential businesses all of our global production and assembly facilities were operational as of december 31 2020 and while we currently expect they will remain operational for the foreseeable future such expectation is dependent upon future governmental actions demand for our products the stability of our global supply chain and our ability to continue to operate in a safe manner 

we remain focused on business continuity and ensuring our facilities remain operational where safe and appropriate to do so we will also continue to serve our customers when needed through our channel partners or inventory on hand to the extent any additional temporary closures or adjustments to production are necessary such measures will be implemented in a way that allows us to resume operations in an efficient and safe manner while also minimizing disruption to customers and our overall business including prudent measures to mitigate to the extent possible any financial impacts although any additional local orders or decrees resulting in new temporary shutdowns will drive further unfavorable impacts to our operations ability to serve our customers and potentially our financial position and liquidity the pandemic will likely continue to impact us in numerous and evolving ways that we may not be able to accurately predict however we will continue to closely monitor its impact on our business employees customers suppliers distribution channels and other business partners and we believe that our actions taken to date our financial flexibility and potential measures within our control will allow us to maintain a sound financial position and provide for adequate resources to fund our ongoing operating and financing needs 

table of contents 

additionally as a response to the covid19 pandemic on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act was enacted and signed into law which included measures to assist companies in response to the covid19 pandemic one measure allowed companies to defer the remittance of the employer portion of the social security tax through december 31 2020 with half the amount deferred required to be paid by december 31 2021 and the other half by december 31 2022 through december 31 2020 we have elected to defer approximately 13 million under this provision which is classified in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet a second measure of the cares act raised the limit on business interest deductions from 30 to 50 of adjusted taxable income for tax years 2019 and 2020 this increased interest limitation resulted in approximately 20 million of reduced cash tax payments in 2020 each of these two measures has resulted in a benefit to our cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2020 however neither measure is expected to materially impact our effective tax rate and no income tax effects have been recorded during the year ended december 31 2020 

the challenges and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as a number of other challenges and uncertainties that could affect our businesses are described further under part i item 1a risk factors

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic we performed interim impairment tests on the goodwill balances of our emea and asia pacific reporting units as well as on certain indefinitelived trade name assets in these two regions during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed in notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements the results of these interim impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair value of our asia pacific reporting unit and three indefinitelived trade names were impaired consequently goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling 963 million were recorded 

further impairment charges were recorded in our asia pacific segment during the year ended december 31 2020 including 26 million related to supply chain disruptions that reduced a brands expected future cash flows and 28 million related to declines in volumes and pricing pressure for a separate subsidiary in the region 

loss on assets held for sale 

the assets and liabilities of our qmi business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of december 31 2020 accordingly qmis net assets which primarily included working capital and longlived assets were written down to fair value estimated based on expected sales proceeds less cost to sell resulting in a loss on assets held for sale of 379 million 

turkey and colombia divestitures 

in 2019 we closed our production facility in turkey to help streamline our footprint in emea and subsequently sold certain of the production assets which represented a business for total proceeds of approximately 41 million we recorded a loss on divestiture of 242 million 255 million net of tax primarily driven by the reclassification of 250 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments to earnings upon sale we also sold our interests in our colombia operations in 2019 for a nominal amount recording a net loss on divestiture of 59 million of which 12 million related to the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments to earnings upon sale

the decrease in net revenues was principally driven by lower volumes across all regions primarily due to the economic challenges stemming from the ongoing covid19 pandemic particularly during the second quarter of 2020 the decrease was to a lesser degree due to the impact of the divestitures of our colombia and turkey businesses in 2019 as discussed above these decreases were slightly offset by improved pricing and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

pricing includes increases or decreases of price including discounts surcharges andor other sales deductions on our existing products and services volume includes increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume of existing products and services as well as new products and services 

cost of goods sold 

for the year ended december 31 2020 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues increased to 567 from 561 due to the following 

table of contents 



costs of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 increased primarily due to the impact of reduced volumes and product mix and to a lesser extent inflation in excess of pricing and productivity inflation in excess of pricing and productivity was driven by productivity challenges stemming from the temporary closures during the second quarter discussed above labor inefficiencies such as increased absenteeism and increased costs related to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment in light of the covid19 pandemic these increases were partially offset by certain nonus government incentives which were included within inflation in excess of pricing and productivity as well as the impacts of the divestitures discussed above foreign currency exchange rate movements and a yearoveryear decrease in restructuring expenses the yearoveryear decrease in restructuring expenses impacting costs of goods sold is due to the prior year restructuring costs related to the closure of our production facility in turkey in 2019 

inflation in excess of pricing and productivity includes the impact to cost of goods sold from pricing as defined above in addition to productivity and inflation productivity represents improvements in unit costs of materials and cost reductions related to improvements to our manufacturing design and processes inflation includes unit costs for the current period compared to the average actual cost for the prior period multiplied by current year volumes 

volumeproduct mix represents the impact due to increases or decreases of revenue due to changes in unit volume including new products and services including the effect of changes in the mix of products and services sold on cost of goods sold 

selling and administrative expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2020 selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 234 from 239 due to the following 



selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased primarily due to productivity benefits in excess of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movements these decreases were partially offset by unfavorable leverage due to lower volumes increased investment spending and a yearoveryear increase in restructuring and acquisition expenses 

productivity in excess of inflation includes the impact from reductions in selling and administrative expenses due to productivity projects and current period costs of ongoing selling and administrative functions compared to the same ongoing expenses in the prior period productivity in excess of inflation also reflects the benefits of certain nonus government incentives reductions in variable compensation and reductions or delays of other business spending in the current year in response to the covid19 pandemic 

volume leverage represents the contribution margin related to changes in sales volume excluding the impact of price productivity mix and inflation expenses related to increased head count for strategic initiatives new facilities or significant improvements for strategic initiatives and new product development are captured in investment spending in the table above 

operating incomemargin 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 1616 million from the same period in 2019 and operating margin decreased to 148 from 198 due to the following 

table of contents 



the decreases in operating income and operating margin were largely driven by our current year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and loss on assets held for sale related to our qmi business as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic we determined a triggering event had occurred as of march 31 2020 and performed interim impairment testing on the goodwill balances of our emea and asia pacific reporting units as well as on certain indefinitelived trade name assets in these two regions which resulted in impairment charges totaling 963 million additional intangible asset impairments of 26 million and 28 million were recorded in our asia pacific segment in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 respectively further as we concluded that the net assets of our qmi business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of december 31 2020 they were written down to fair value estimated based on expected sales proceeds less cost to sell which resulted in a loss of 379 million 

the decreases in operating income and operating margin were also attributable to unfavorable volumeproduct mix a yearoveryear increase in restructuring and acquisition expenses and increased investment spending these decreases were partially offset by pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation foreign currency exchange rate movements and the impact of the divestitures discussed above 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 49 million compared to 2019 which is due to a lower weightedaverage interest rate during the current year on our outstanding indebtedness and a 27 million prior year charge for the writeoff of previously deferred financing costs related to the term facility which did not recur in the current period 

loss on divestitures 

in 2019 we closed our production facility in turkey and subsequently sold certain of the production assets thereof which represented a business for total proceeds of approximately 41 million we recorded a loss on divestiture of 242 million 255 million net of tax primarily driven by the reclassification of 250 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments to earnings upon sale we also sold our interests in our colombia operations in 2019 for a nominal amount recording a net loss on divestiture of 59 million of which 12 million related to the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments to earnings upon sale

table of contents

provision for income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our effective tax rate was 139 compared to 154 for the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by the unfavorable tax impact related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the unfavorable yearoveryear change in the amounts recognized for valuation allowances 

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emea and asia pacific beginning in the second quarter of 2020 results for the companys india operations have been included within the asia pacific segment results due to an operational change this change did not result in a material impact to segment results of operations for either the emea or asia pacific segment these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income loss is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income loss represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges to arrive at a segment operating income loss that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income loss as a percentage of the segments net revenues 

the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in net earnings

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development and fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service any future debt pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from our operating activities and to access our borrowing facilities including unused availability under our revolving facility and capital markets 

throughout 2020 we have closely monitored the developments related to the covid19 pandemic including the resulting uncertainties around customer demand supply chain disruption the availability and cost of materials customer and supplier financial condition levels of liquidity and our ongoing compliance with debt covenants while our business and results of

historically the majority of our earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations at december 31 2020 we have analyzed our working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain subsidiaries made distributions and concluded that no material changes to our historic permanent reinvestment assertions are required 

defined benefit plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status asset allocation and the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans regularly in addition to investment manager performance none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

at december 31 2020 we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of 412 million and 76 million of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax these liabilities have been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

• goodwill – goodwill is tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and starts with a comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill 

table of contents 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair values is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market multiple of earnings market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of revenue growth rates terminal growth rates margin assumptions and discount rates to estimate future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach requires determining an appropriate peer group which is utilized to derive estimated fair values of our reporting units based on selected market multiples the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the selected peer group companies and the subject reporting units 

as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic we concluded a triggering event had occurred as of march 31 2020 and accordingly performed interim impairment testing on the goodwill balances of our emea and asia pacific reporting units given the high degree of market volatility and lack of reliable market data that existed as of march 31 2020 we determined a discounted cash flow model income approach provided the best approximation of fair value of the emea and asia pacific reporting units for the purpose of performing these interim tests this was a change in estimate as historically our determination of reporting unit fair values has been estimated based on both an income and a market approach as discussed above with each method being weighted in the calculation the results of the interim impairment testing indicated the estimated fair value of the asia pacific reporting unit was less than its carrying value and consequently a goodwill impairment charge of 881 million was recorded 

as markets stabilized throughout the year we reverted to utilizing both an income and market approach while performing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 for the annual 2020 goodwill impairment test completed in the fourth quarter assessing the fair value of our reporting units includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

• decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greaterthanexpected declines in volumes pricing pressures or disruptive technology 

• declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition or an inability to develop or launch new products 

• the impacts of market volatility including greaterthanexpected declines in pricing reductions in volumes or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 

• the level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts including those related to acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products 

• increases in the price or decreases in the availability of key commodities and the impact of higher energy prices and 

• increases in our marketparticipant riskadjusted weightedaverage cost of capital 

• indefinitelived intangible assets – similar to goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than its carrying amount recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess during the first quarter of 2020 we concluded the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic to be a triggering event accordingly interim impairment tests on certain indefinitelived trade names were performed as of march 31 2020 based on these tests it was determined that three of our indefinitelived trade names in the emea and asia pacific segments were impaired and impairment charges totaling 82 million were recorded 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the terminal growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in future revenue projections could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our indefinitelived intangible assets

• income taxes – we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize future tax benefits such as net operating losses and nonus tax credits to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not we regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability projected future taxable income timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies where appropriate we record a valuation allowance with respect to future tax benefits 

the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimates if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

• defined benefit plans – we provide several us and nonus defined benefit pension plan benefits to eligible employees and retirees our noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering noncollectively bargained us employees provide benefits on an average pay formula while most plans for collectively bargained us employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula the nonus pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service determining the costs associated with such plans is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets employee mortality and turnover rates actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with gaap actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into earnings over future periods 

we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions as appropriate the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the expected return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation we believe the assumptions utilized in recording our defined benefit obligations are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension benefit cost an estimated 025 rate decline in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension benefit cost by approximately 11 million in 2021 while a 025 rate decline in the estimated return on assets would increase net periodic pension benefit cost by approximately 19 million 

• business combinations – the fair value of consideration paid in a business combination is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and goodwill acquired intangible assets primarily include indefinitelived trade names customer relationships and completed technologies the accounting for business combinations involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimation including the fair value of acquired intangible assets involving projections of future revenues and cash flows that are either discounted at an estimated discount rate or measured at an estimated royalty rate fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities including potential contingencies and the useful lives of the acquired assets the assumptions used to determine the fair value of acquired intangible assets include projections developed using internal forecasts available industry and market data estimates of longterm growth rates profitability customer attrition and royalty rates which are determined at the time of acquisition an income approach or market approach or both is utilized in accordance with accepted valuation models for each acquired intangible asset to determine fair value the impact of prior or future business combinations on our financial condition or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2020 a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 169 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2020 

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities accrue interest at our option of i a libor rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 1125 to 1500 depending on our credit ratings at december 31 2020 the outstanding borrowings of 2388 million under the term facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin of 1250 we are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings as we currently have unused availability of 4850 million under our revolving facility as of december 31 2020 if libor or other applicable base rates of our credit facilities increase in the future our interest expense could increase

we believe that the security products industry is growing and will continue to benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends including 

 

we believe the security products industry will also benefit from continued growth in institutional commercial and residential endmarkets as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes we also expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform growth in mechanical products 

we operate in three geographic regions americas europe middle east india and africa emeia and asia pacific we sell our products and solutions under the following brands 

  





we sell a wide range of security and access control solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential facilities worldwide including the education healthcare government hospitality commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our leading brands include cisa® interflex® lcn® schlage® simonsvoss® and von duprin® we believe lcn schlage and von duprin hold the no 1 position in their primary product categories in north america while cisa interflex and simonsvoss hold the no1 or no 2 position in their primary product categories in certain european markets 

  

during the year ended december 31 2019  we generated net revenues of 28540 million and operating income of 5651 million  

history and developments 

we were incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 we became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established nearly 100 years ago and many originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products 

in addition in 2018 we announced the formation of allegion ventures a corporate venture fund that invests in and helps accelerate the growth of companies that have innovative technologies and products since its formation allegion ventures has invested nearly 10 million in several earlystage companies that share our pioneering vision and seek to find smart and innovative solutions that help keep people and assets safe and secure in the places where they reside work and thrive

industry and competition 

the global markets we serve encompass institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets throughout north america emeia and asia pacific in recent years as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities and single and multifamily homes including iot growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform growth in mechanical security products and solutions we expect the security products industry will continue to benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab and dormakaba group we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against new more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth innovation integration with popular technology platforms quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision point we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing net revenues by quarter for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  are as follows 



employees 

we believe in fundamental standards that support our commitment to our employees including a commitment to safe and healthy workspaces respect for diversity and competitive wages and benefits we are also committed to creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive environment as an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action employer we are fully committed to our equal employment opportunity policy and will not discriminate based on race sex color national origin creed religion pregnancy age disability military status protected veteran status sexual orientation gender identity genetic information marital status or 

any legally protected status we are dedicated to fulfilling this commitment as it relates to decisions regarding all employment actions at all levels of employment as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 11000 employees 

environmental matters 

we have a dedicated environmental program designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities we also regularly evaluate our remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future for a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes in this form 10k quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia china europe korea mexico new zealand and the united arab emirates the political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business in the us and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin reduce cash flow and negatively impact our ability to compete 

our business relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

increased competition including from technological developments could adversely affect our business 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise effective channels to market breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases further in a number of our product offerings we compete with our retail customers who use their own private labels if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives including increased competition from private label brands the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical electronic and digital products technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape our success depends in part upon the research 

development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete the continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer and consumer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

we also sell our products through various trade channels including traditional retail and ecommerce channels if we or our major customers are not successful in navigating the shifting consumer preferences to distribution channels such as ecommerce our expected future revenues may be negatively impacted 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

approximately 30 of our 2019 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure and therefore our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business and innovation strategies include making acquisitions of and investments in external companies these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating and financial results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete acquisitions with suitable candidates in the future nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful including efficient integration and creation of synergies 

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable for these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions also involve numerous other risks including 

 

further as part of allegion’s innovation strategy from time to time we invest in startup companies andor development stage technology or other companies in evaluating these opportunities we follow a structured evaluation process that considers factors such as potential financial returns new expertise in emerging technology and business benefits despite our best efforts to calculate potential return and risk some or all of these companies we invest in may be unprofitable at the time of and subsequent to our investment we may lose money in these investments including the potential for future impairment charges on the investments and the anticipated benefits of the technology and business relationships may be less than expected 

we continually look to expand our services and products into international markets as we expand into new international markets we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets in some instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets certain international markets may be slower than us markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into certain international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from core business 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services we can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove to be successful among other negative effects our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital in the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

our restructuring plans may not be successful 

we have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market changes product changes performance issues changes in strategy acquisitions and other internal and external considerations historically these types of restructuring activities have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our net revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental product liability antitrust intellectual property data protection privacy and labor and employment matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those products or services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by adverse publicity or improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

further adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales 

disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners may negatively impact our business 

our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

we outsource certain manufacturing and logistical services to partners located throughout the world our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays if we are unable to effectively manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed 

the effects of global climate change or other unexpected events including global health crises may disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our business 

the effects of global climate change such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects or the occurrence of unexpected events including wildfires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes floods tsunamis and other severe hazards or global health crises such as the outbreak of ebola or the coronavirus or other rapid outbreak and spread of a communicable disease or virus in the countries where we operate or sell products and provide services could adversely affect our operations and financial performance extreme weather natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing causing physical damage and partial or complete closure of our manufacturing sites or distribution centers loss of human capital temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products and services and disruption in our ability to deliver products and services to customers these events and disruptions could also increase insurance and other operating costs including impacting our decisions regarding construction of new facilities to select areas less prone to climate change risks and natural disasters which could result in indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain or other price modifications to our products and services 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems networks and services including hardware software firmware and technological applications and platforms collectively it systems to manage and operate our business from endtoend including ordering and managing materials from suppliers design and development manufacturing marketing selling and shipping to customers invoicing and billing managing our banking and cash liquidity systems managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements there can be no assurance that our current it systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our it systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that any newly implemented it systems will improve our current systems improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new it systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented and maintained negatively impact our business if our it systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on thirdparty vendors for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to thirdparty service providers in order to achieve efficiencies if such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us 

despite our implementation of network security measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products including access solutions may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses malicious codes malware ransomware phishing social engineering denial of service hacking breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions the scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs 

  

our daily business operations also require us to collect andor retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers employees suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the european unions general data protection regulation that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect such data the loss or breach of such data due to various causes including material security breaches catastrophic events extreme weather natural disasters power outages system failures computer viruses improper data handling programming errors unauthorized access and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

in addition we operate in an environment where there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws and regulations in effect or expected to go into effect in the future including regulations related to devices connected through the iot in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with such laws and regulations while ensuring our data is secure 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

commodity shortages price increases and higher energy prices could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to our customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising energy prices and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets 

at december 31 2019  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 8733 million and 1230 million  respectively pursuant to gaap we are required to annually assess our goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired in addition interim assessments must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred significant disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges to goodwill or result in the impairment of our indefinitelived intangible assets or other longlived assets specifically an unanticipated deterioration in net revenues andor operating margins generated by our emeia andor asia pacific segments could trigger future impairments in those segments any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods recognized 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on the contributions and abilities of our employees and key management including for example the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to effectively recruit retain and motivate key management sales and other highly qualified and skilled personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees for various reasons including changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and environmental health and safety standards we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see business  environmental matters 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and longterm credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

as a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions 

since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and 

our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations interpretations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both us and nonus tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” enacted in december 2017 in the us had a significant impact on our cash tax obligations in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed recommended or implemented changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

  

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

we have approximately 14 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2019  in addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million  volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future a portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchases or future business opportunities 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in such event we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 

additionally at december 31 2019  our borrowings include a variable rate term loan facility indexed to libor the term facility and together with the revolving facility the credit facilities with an outstanding balance of 2388 million  which exposes us to interest rate risk however at december 31 2019  we also have interest rate swaps for 200 million of our floatingrate term loans which expire in september 2020  to manage our interest rate risk we are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings under our revolving facility if libor or other applicable base rates under our credit facilities increase in the future our interest expense could increase additionally the regulator that oversees libor has announced that it cannot guarantee libors availability after 2021 in the event libor is discontinued replaced significantly changed or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of our applicable interest rate or required payment amounts for our credit facilities this could also require different hedging strategies and require renegotiation of our existing credit facilities while we do not currently anticipate the transition from libor and the risks thereto to have a material adverse effect on us it remains uncertain at this time 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act 2014 of ireland as amended which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 5 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always be approved if the directors authority to issue ordinary shares is not renewed then we may be limited in our ability to use our shares for example as consideration for acquisitions 

  

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor our effective tax rate for instance recently enacted us tax legislation could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor our effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax 20 prior to december 31 2019 25 thereafter from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders residing in the us will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our memorandum and articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contains provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we sold certain of the former production assets of our turkey facility for total proceeds of approximately 41 million  the company recorded a loss on divestiture of 242 million  255 million  net of tax primarily driven by 250 million of cumulative currency translation adjustments previously deferred in equity that were reclassified into earnings upon sale

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019  increased  20 million compared to the same period of 2018  primarily due to a 27 million charge related to the writeoff of previously deferred financing costs related to our term facility this charge was recognized in conjunction with a 4000 million principal payment to partially pay down the outstanding term facility balance in 2019 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018  decreased  517 million compared to the same period of 2017  primarily due to 447 million of costs in 2017 associated with the refinancing of our credit facilities issuance of our 3200 and 3550 senior notes and redemption of our previously outstanding senior notes in 2017 lower interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness also contributed to the decrease in interest expense 

loss on divestitures 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a loss on divestitures of 301 million related to the divestitures of our business operations in colombia and turkey 

in june 2019 we closed our production facility in turkey and subsequently sold certain of the production assets thereof for total proceeds of approximately 41 million  we recorded a loss on divestiture of 242 million  255 million  net of tax primarily driven by 250 million of cumulative currency translation adjustments previously deferred in equity that were reclassified to earnings upon sale 

additionally during the fourth quarter of 2019 we sold our interests in our colombia operations for an immaterial amount as a result of the sale we recorded a net loss on divestiture of 59 million  of which 12 million relates to cumulative currency translation adjustments previously deferred in equity that were reclassified to earnings upon sale 

neither of these divestitures is expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows 

other expense income net 

the components of other expense income net for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



for the year ended december 31 2019  other expense income net was unfavorable  72 million compared to 2018  due primarily to an unfavorable change in net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost income less service cost of 96 million  this increase in expense was partially offset by investment income of 31 million during 2019 which is included within other in the table above 

for the year ended december 31 2018  other income net decreased by 55 million compared with the same period in 2017 due to a cumulative gain of 54 million from the sale of idevices llc and gains of 73 million related to legal entity liquidations in our asia pacific region of which 22 million was attributed to noncontrolling interests in 2017 neither of which recurred in 2018 these decreases were partially offset by net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income less service cost of 28 million in 2018  compared to net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost less service cost of 43 million in 2017  

provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the president of the united states signed comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” the tax reform act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code which impacted our years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate 

tax rate 2 requiring a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and 3 requiring a review of the future realizability of deferred tax balances 

for the year ended december 31 2019  our effective tax rate was 154  compared to 84 for the year ended december 31 2018  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the favorable benefit related to the tax reform act recorded in 2018 and the tax costs associated with divestitures in 2019 

for the year ended december 31 2018  our effective tax rate was 84  compared to 301 for the year ended december 31 2017  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was positively impacted by guidance related to the tax reform act and the reduction in the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 was negatively impacted by the enactment of the tax reform act which was partially offset by a release of valuation allowances 

  

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of the segments net revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service any future debt pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from our operating activities and to access our borrowing facilities including unused availability under our revolving facility and capital markets we believe that our future cash provided by operating activities availability under our revolving facility and access to funds on hand and capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019  increased 304 million compared to 2018  primarily driven by changes in working capital 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 1106 million compared to 2017  this increase was primarily due to higher net earnings in 2018 and a discretionary 500 million contribution to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017  partially offset by changes in working capital and an increase in cash paid for taxes 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2019  decreased 3662 million compared to 2018  the decrease is primarily due to a 3685 million reduction in cash payments related to acquisitions and equity investments in businesses as well as the purchase of 143 million of investments during the year ended december 31 2018  which did not recur in 2019  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of 165 million during 2019 compared to 2018  

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 3936 million compared to 2017  the increase is primarily due to 3761 million of cash payments related to acquisitions and equity investments in businesses during 2018  compared to 208 million for an acquisition in 2017  additionally contributing to the increase in net cash used in investing activities was the purchase of 143 million of investments during the year ended december 31 2018 and the sale of an equity investment during 2017  which resulted in an investing cash inflow of 156 million that did not recur in 2018  

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2019  increased 1588 million compared to 2018  the increase is primarily due to increases of 1587 million in share repurchases and 212 million in dividend payments yearoveryear partially offsetting these increases was an 182 million decrease in debt repayments net compared to 2018  

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 325 million compared to 2017  the increase is primarily due to an increase in dividend payments of 185 million yearoveryear additionally during the year ended december 31 2018  we repurchased 673 million of common shares compared to 600 million during 2017 

capitalization 

at december 31 longterm debt and other borrowings consisted of the following 



as of december 31 2019  we have an unsecured credit agreement in place consisting of a 7000 million term loan facility the “term facility” of which 2388 million is outstanding at december 31 2019  and a 5000 million revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” and together with the term facility the “credit facilities” the credit facilities mature on september 12 2022 

at inception the term facility was scheduled to amortize in quarterly installments at the following rates 125 per quarter starting december 31 2017 through december 31 2020 25 per quarter from march 31 2021 through june 30 2022 with the balance due on september 12 2022 principal amounts repaid on the term facility may not be reborrowed during the year ended december 31 2019  we made a 4000 million principal payment to partially pay down the outstanding term facility balance utilizing all of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 3500 senior notes plus cash on hand as a result of this payment we 

have satisfied our obligation to make quarterly installments on the term facility up to the maturity date with the remaining outstanding balance due on september 12 2022 

the revolving facility provides aggregate commitments of up to 5000 million  which includes up to 1000 million for the issuance of letters of credit at december 31 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving facility and we had 163 million of letters of credit outstanding commitments under the revolving facility may be reduced at any time without premium or penalty and amounts repaid may be reborrowed 

outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities accrue interest at our option of i a libor rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 1125 to 1500 depending on our credit ratings to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor rates we have interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate for 2000 million of the outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2019 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  we also have 4000 million outstanding of 3200 senior notes due 2024 the “3200 senior notes” and 4000 million outstanding of 3550 senior notes due 2027 the “3550 senior notes” the 3200 senior notes and 3550 senior notes require semiannual interest payments on april 1 and october 1 of each year and will mature on october 1 2024 and october 1 2027 respectively additionally during the year ended december 31 2019  we issued 4000 million aggregate principal amount of our 3500 senior notes due 2029 the 3500 senior notes the 3500 senior notes require semiannual interest payments on april 1 and october 1 beginning april 1 2020 and will mature on october 1 2029 net proceeds from the issuance of the 3500 senior notes along with cash on hand were utilized to make the 4000 million principal payment on the term facility discussed above 

historically the majority of our earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations at december 31 2019  we have analyzed our working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain subsidiaries made distributions and concluded that no material changes to our historic permanent reinvestment assertions are required 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status asset allocation and the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans regularly in addition to investment manager performance none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods 



future interest payments on variable rate longterm debt are estimated based on the rate in effect as of december 31 2019  future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2019  we had net pension liabilities of 350 million  which consist of plan assets of 7105 million and benefit obligations of 7455 million  it is our objective to contribute to our pension plans in order to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required at december 31 2019  the funded 

status of our qualified pension plan for us employees increased to 935 from 931 at december 31 2018  the funded status for our nonus pension plans increased to 1011 at december 31 2019 from 987 at december 31 2018  the funded status for all of our pension plans at december 31 2019 increased to 953 from 941 at december 31 2018  we currently project that approximately 115 million will be contributed to our plans worldwide in 2020  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 

at december 31 2019  we had postretirement benefit obligations of 68 million  we fund opeb costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidies are not expected to be material in 2020  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for opeb obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table 

income taxes 

at december 31 2019  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  373 million and  62 million of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax these liabilities have been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and starts with a comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill of the reporting unit 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair values is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market multiple of earnings market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of revenue growth rates margin assumptions and discount rates to estimate future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach requires the determination of an appropriate peer group which is utilized to derive estimated fair values of our reporting units based on selected market 

multiples the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the selected peer group companies and the subject reporting units 

the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 15 for the 2019 goodwill impairment test assessing the fair value of our reporting units includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

 other indefinitelived intangible assets – recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess based on the result of our 2019 impairment testing it was determined that two of our indefinitelived trade names were impaired accordingly an impairment charge of 59 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our endmarkets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our indefinitelived intangible assets the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

 our remaining net revenues involve services including installation and consulting unlike the single performance obligation to ship a product or bundle of products revenue recognition related to services revenues is delayed until the service based performance obligations are satisfied in some instances customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the service meets the criteria established in the order in these instances revenue recognition is deferred until the performance obligations are satisfied which could include acceptance terms specified in the arrangement being fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied 

we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component as the time period between control transfer of goods and services is less than one year sales valueadded and other similar taxes collected by us are excluded from net revenues we also have elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control 

of the related goods transfers as fulfillment activities instead of performance obligations our payment terms are generally consistent with the industries in which our businesses operate 

sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are accounted for as variable consideration and therefore as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain level of purchases remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are also considered variable consideration and are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and a liability variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount we expect to receive from customers each of these accruals represents the company’s best estimate of the most likely amount expected to be received from customers based on historical experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in the company’s results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between the company’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements we also offer a standard warranty with most product sales and the value of such warranty is included in the contractual price the corresponding cost of the warranty obligation is accrued as a liability see note 21 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimates if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date 

we believe the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2020 net periodic pension benefit cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 09 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 07 million

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2019  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 127 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2019  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities accrue interest at our option of i a libor rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 1125 to 1500 depending on our credit ratings at december 31 2019  the outstanding borrowings of 2388 million under the term facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin of 1250  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor rates we have interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate for 2000 million of the outstanding borrowings which expire in september 2020  

we are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings as we have the ability to incur up to 500 million of additional variablerate debt under our revolving facility if libor or other applicable base rates of our credit facilities increase in the future our interest expense could increase

for the year ended december 31 2018  we generated net revenues of 27317 million  and operating income of 5258 million  

history and developments 

we were incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 we became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established nearly 100 years ago and many originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products in 2018 product innovation spanned 

 

recent examples of successful product launches are illustrated in the table below

industry and competition 

the global markets we serve encompass commercial institutional and residential construction markets throughout north america emeia and asia pacific in recent years as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities and single and multifamily homes growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform growth in mechanical security products and solutions we expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab and dormakaba group we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against new more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth integration with popular technology platforms quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain

raw materials 

we support our regionofuse production strategy with corresponding regionofuse supplier partners where available our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership product management and materials management teams to ensure adequate materials are available for production 

we purchase a wide range of raw materials including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals to support our production facilities where appropriate we may enter into fixedcost contracts to lower overall costs 

intellectual property 

intellectual property inclusive of certain patents trademarks copyrights knowhow trade secrets and other proprietary rights is important to our business we create protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights we use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others we consider our cisa interflex lcn schlage simonsvoss von duprin and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license or any particular group of patents or licenses 

facilities 

we operate through a broad network of sales offices engineering centers 34  production and assembly facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world our active properties represent approximately 69   million square feet of which approximately 37   is leased the following table shows the location of our worldwide production and assembly facilities

we manage our rd team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms we are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations in addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region we also operate a global engineering design center in bangalore india 

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing net revenues by quarter for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  are as follows 



employees 

as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 11000 employees 

environmental regulation 

we have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities we regularly evaluate our remediation programs and consider alternative remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes 

 11 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  24 million   32 million  and 233 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  226 million  and  289 million  respectively of these amounts  63 million  and  89 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain

 item 1a     risk factors   

we discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes in this form 10k quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications all statements except for historical and present factual information are “forwardlooking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia china colombia europe korea mexico new zealand turkey and the united arab emirates the political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business in the us and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin reduce cash flow and negatively impact our ability to compete 

our business relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

increased competition including from technical developments could adversely affect our business 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise effective channels to market breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical electronic and digital products technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape our success depends in part upon the research development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others 

 13 

will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete the continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business the speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

approximately 30 of our 2018 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure and therefore our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful 

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire or invest in may be marginally profitable or unprofitable for these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we 

 14 

may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

we continually look to expand our services and products into international markets as we expand into new international markets we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets in some instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets certain international markets may be slower than us markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into certain international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from core business 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services we can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove to be successful among other negative effects our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital in the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

our periodic restructuring plans may not be successful 

we have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market changes product changes performance issues changes in strategy acquisitions and other internal and external considerations historically these types of restructuring activities have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our net revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without 

 15 

limitation environmental product liability intellectual property data protection and labor and employment matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners may negatively impact our business 

our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

we outsource certain manufacturing and logistical services to partners located throughout the world our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays if we are unable to effectively manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems networks and services including hardware software firmware and technological applications and platforms collectively it systems to manage and operate our business from endtoend including ordering and managing materials from suppliers design and development manufacturing marketing selling and shipping to customers invoicing and billing managing our banking and cash liquidity systems managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements there can be no assurance that our current it systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our it systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that any newly implemented it systems will improve our current systems improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new it systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented and maintained negatively impact our business if our it systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

 16 

we currently rely on thirdparty vendors for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to thirdparty service providers in order to achieve efficiencies if such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us 

despite our implementation of network security measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products including access solutions may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses malicious codes malware ransomware phishing social engineering denial of service hacking breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions the scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs 

  

our daily business operations also require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the european unions general data protection regulation the loss or breach of such information due to various causes including catastrophic events natural disasters power outages system failures computer viruses improper data handling and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

commodity shortages price increases and higher energy prices could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to our customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising energy prices and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets 

at december 31 2018  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 8830 million  and 1306 million  respectively pursuant to gaap we are required to annually assess our goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired in addition interim assessments must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets and the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets in the period the determination is made disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we have significant intangible assets including goodwill with an indefinite life which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in such factors and conditions 

the basis of the fair value for our impairment assessments is determined by projecting future cash flows using assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weightedaverage cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization although our last analysis regarding the fair values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for our reporting units indicates that they exceed their respective carrying values materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price could result in goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses specifically an unanticipated deterioration in net revenues and operating margins generated by our emeia andor asia pacific segments could trigger future impairment in those segments while we currently believe that our projected results will not result in future impairment a deterioration in results or other factors could trigger a future impairment 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce 

our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on the contributions and abilities of our employees and key management including for example the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to effectively recruit retain and motivate key management sales and other highly qualified and skilled personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees for various reasons including changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and environmental health and safety standards we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see business  environmental regulation 

 18 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and longterm credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

as a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions 

since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations interpretations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both us and nonus tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “tax reform act” enacted in december 2017 in the us had a significant impact on our cash tax obligations and the issuance of additional regulatory guidance related to the tax reform act could materially affect our cash tax obligations and effective tax rate in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

  

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

we have approximately 15 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2018  in addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million  volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is 

 19 

dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs or future business opportunities 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 

additionally a portion of our borrowings at december 31 2018  includes a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings at december 31 2018  our 15 billion of aggregate debt outstanding includes  656 million  of floatingrate term loans and 800 million  of fixedrate senior notes we have the ability to incur up to 500 million  of additional floatingrate debt under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we have entered into interest rate swaps for 250 million  of our floatingrate term loans to manage our interest rate risk a 100 basispoint increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2018  interest expense of approximately 43 million  if the libor or other applicable base rates under our senior unsecured credit facilities increase in the future the interest on floatingrate debt could have a material impact on our interest expense 

risks relating to the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff ingersoll rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified ingersoll rand for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to ingersoll rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the ingersoll rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and ingersoll rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with ingersoll rand ingersoll rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify ingersoll rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ingersoll rand retained further the indemnity from ingersoll rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and ingersoll rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ingersoll rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ingersoll rand has received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under sections 355 and 368a of the internal revenue code the code with the result that ingersoll rand and ingersoll rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling ingersoll rand received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the irs did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution received taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the receipt and effectiveness of the irs ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by ingersoll rand the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and 

 20 

the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we or ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

ingersoll rand has received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue ingersoll rand received an opinion from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions the irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irish revenue or the courts and the irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion was based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an irish resident or holds shares in ingersoll rand in an irish branch or agency or we or ingersoll rand could incur irish tax liabilities 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the companies act 2014 of ireland as amended which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash at our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders authorized our board of directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our board of directors to issue up to 5 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always be approved 

  

 21 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor our effective tax rate for instance pending regulatory guidance on the recently enacted us tax legislation could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor our effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders residing in the us will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our memorandum and articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contains provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines 

 22 

is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of the segments net revenues

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service any future debt pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from our operating activities and to access our borrowing facilities including unused availability under our revolving facility and capital markets we believe that our future cash provided by operating activities availability under our revolving facility and access to funds on hand and capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018  increased 1106 million  compared to 2017  this increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2018  was primarily due to higher net earnings in the current year and a discretionary 500 million contribution to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2017  partially offset by changes in working capital and an increase in cash paid for taxes

capitalization 

longterm debt at december 31 consisted of the following 



as of december 31 2018  we have an unsecured credit agreement in place that provides for up to 12000 million  in unsecured financing consisting of a 7000 million  term loan facility the “term facility” and a 5000 million  revolving credit facility the “revolving facility” and together with the term facility the “credit facilities” the credit facilities mature on september 12 2022 the term facility amortizes in quarterly installments at the following rates 125  per quarter starting december 31 2017 through december 31 2020 25  per quarter from march 31 2021 through june 30 2022 with the balance due on september 12 2022 the revolving facility provides aggregate commitments of up to 5000 million  which includes up to 1000 million   

 41 

for the issuance of letters of credit at december 31 2018  there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving facility and we had 171 million  of letters of credit outstanding 

outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities accrue interest at our option of i a libor rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 1125  to 1500  depending on our credit ratings to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor rates we have interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate for 2500 million  of the outstanding borrowings see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2018  we also have 4000 million  outstanding of 3200  senior notes due 2024 the “3200 senior notes” and 4000 million  outstanding of 3550  senior notes due 2027 the “3550 senior notes” and together with the 3200 senior notes the “notes” the notes require semiannual interest payments on april 1 and october 1 of each year and will mature on october 1 2024 and october 1 2027 respectively 

historically the majority of our earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations as a result of the tax reform act transition tax we analyzed our global working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain nonus subsidiaries made distributions which include local country withholding tax and potential us state taxation based on this analysis we made no changes to our permanent reinvestment assertions to reinvest earnings in our nonus subsidiaries outside of the us 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contributions and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis in january 2017 we made a discretionary 500 million contribution to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan at december 31 2018  the funded status of our qualified pension plan for us employees decreased to 931  from 933  at december 31 2017  the funded status for our nonus pension plans decreased to 987  at december 31 2018  from 1005  at december 31 2017  funded status for all of our pension plans at december 31 2018  decreased to 941  from 955  at december 31 2017  for further details on pension plan activity see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods 



future interest payments on variable rate longterm debt are estimated based on the rate in effect as of december 31 2018 future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2018  we had net pension liabilities of 385 million  which consist of plan assets of 6116 million  and benefit obligations of 6501 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required the funded status for all of our pension plans decreased to 941  at december 31 2018  from 955  at december 31 2017  we currently project that an additional approximately 116 million  will be contributed to our plans worldwide in 2019    because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements 

 42 

for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2018  we had postretirement benefit obligations of 76 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally   on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidies are not expected to be material in 2019  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table 

income taxes 

at december 31 2018  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  420 million  and  57 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax these liabilities have been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and starts with a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair values is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publiclytraded companies and the subject reporting units 

 43 

the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 15 for the 2018  goodwill impairment test additionally a 1 increase in the discount rate used or a 1 decrease in the terminal growth rate would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value 

assessing the fair value of our reporting units includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

 other indefinitelived intangible assets   we performed our annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing in 2018  and determined our indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is determined on a relief from royalty methodology which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our endmarkets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our indefinitelived intangible assets the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows

service or a bundle of products or services to a customer and is the unit of account under asc 606 we have two principal revenue streams tangible product sales and services approximately 99 of consolidated net revenues involve contracts with a single performance obligation the transfer of control of a product or bundle of products to a customer transfer of control typically occurs when goods are shipped from our facilities or at other predetermined control transfer points for instance destination terms net revenues are measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring control of the products and takes into account variable consideration such as sales incentive programs including discounts and volume rebates the existence of these programs does not preclude revenue recognition but does require our best estimate of the variable consideration to be made based on expected activity as these items are reserved for as a deduction to net revenues over time based on our historical rates of providing these incentives and annual forecasted sales volumes 

our remaining net revenues involve services including installation and consulting unlike the single performance obligation to ship a product or bundle of products the service revenue stream delays revenue recognition until the service performance obligations are satisfied in some instances customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the service meets the criteria established in the order in these instances revenue recognition is deferred until the performance obligations are satisfied which could include acceptance terms specified in the arrangement being fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied 

we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component as the time period between control transfer of goods and services is less than one year sales valueadded and other similar taxes collected by us are excluded from net revenues we also have elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related goods transfers as fulfillment activities instead of performance obligations our payment terms are generally consistent with the industries in which our businesses operate 

      sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are accounted for as variable consideration and therefore as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2018  and 2017  we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 316 million  and 325 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain level of purchases remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are also considered variable consideration and are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and a liability at december 31 2018  and 2017  we had a sales incentive accrual of 339 million  and 318 million  respectively variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount we expect to receive from customers each of these accruals represents the company’s best estimate of the most likely amount expected to be received from customers based on historical experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in the company’s results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between the company’s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements we also offer a standard warranty with most product sales and the value of such warranty is included in the contractual price the corresponding cost of the warranty obligation is accrued as a liability see note 20 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimates if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

the tax reform act constituted a major change to the us tax system the estimated impact of the tax reform act is based on current interpretations and related assumptions as discussed further in note 17 to the consolidated financial 

 45 

statements where applicable we included estimates in our consolidated financial statements for impacts of the new tax reform act the actual impact to us may be materially different from current estimates based on future regulatory developments 

 we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date 

we believe the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2018  net periodic pension benefit cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 08 million  and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 06 million

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2018  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 68 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2018  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities accrue interest at the option of the company of i a libor rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin ranges from 1125  to 1500  depending on the companys credit ratings at december 31 2018  the outstanding borrowings under the term facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin of 1250  to manage the companys exposure to fluctuations in libor rates the company has interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate for 2500 million  of the outstanding borrowings 

these swaps expire in september 2020  a 100 basispoint increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2018  interest expense of approximately 43 million  if the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future our floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense

history and developments 

we were incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 we became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago and many of our brands originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products recent examples of successful product launches are illustrated in the table below

industry and competition 

the global markets we serve encompass commercial institutional and residential construction markets throughout north america europe the middle east and asiapacific in recent years growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities we expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab and dormakaba group we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against new more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain 

our reporting segments 

we manufacture and sell mechanical and electronic security products and solutions in approximately 130 countries approximately 96 of our 2017  revenues were to customers in the north america western europe and the asiapacific regions

research and development 

we are committed to investing in highly productive research and development capabilities particularly in electromechanical systems our research and development rd expenditures were approximately  483 million   473 million  and  452 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions and also on driving continuous improvements in product cost quality safety and sustainability 

we manage our rd team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms we are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations in addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region we also operate a global engineering center of excellence in bangalore india 

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales typically are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however our interflex business typically experiences higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing revenue by quarter for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  are as follows 



employees 

we currently have approximately 10000 employees 

environmental regulation 

we have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities the company regularly evaluates its remediation programs and considers alternative remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those currently utilized by the company based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  32 million   233 million  and 44 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  289 million  and  306 million  of these amounts  89 million  and  96 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain

 item 1a     risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia china europe korea mexico new zealand and turkey the political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business in the us and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin and negatively impact our ability to compete 

our business relies on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

increased competition including from technical developments could adversely affect our business 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in a market that is experiencing the convergence of the mechanical electronic and digital products technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape our success depends in part upon the research development and implementation of new technologies and products securing key partnerships and alliances as well as employee talent including having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete the continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

 13 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

approximately 30 of our 2017 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire or invest in may be marginally profitable or unprofitable for these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

 14 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

we continually look to expand our services and products into international markets as we expand into new international markets we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets in other instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets certain international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations or effectively compete in new markets we enter any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from core business 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services we can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove to be successful among other negative effects our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital in the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

our periodic restructuring plans may not be successful 

we have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market changes product changes performance issues change in strategies acquisitions and other internal and external considerations historically these types of restructuring have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe these effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal 

 15 

proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners may negatively impact our business 

our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements the loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business 

we outsource certain manufacturing and logistical services to partners located throughout the world our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays if we are unable to manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business there can be no assurance that our current information technology systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our information technology systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that any newly implemented information technology systems will improve our current systems will improve our operations or will yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented negatively impact our business if our information technology systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

 16 

we currently rely on a single vendor for many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure to a thirdparty service provider in order to achieve efficiencies if the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us 

despite our implementation of network security measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions the scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs 

  

our daily business operations also require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure the loss or breach of such information could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee errors or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

commodity shortages price increases and higher energy prices could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices due to the instability of current market prices higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to our customers around the world consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising energy prices and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2017  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 7612 million  and 754 million  respectively pursuant to gaap we are required to annually assess our goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired in addition interim assessments must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value 

 17 

of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we have significant intangible assets including goodwill with an indefinite life which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in such factors and conditions 

the basis of the fair value for our impairment assessments is determined by projecting future cash flows using assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization although our last analysis regarding the fair values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for our reporting units indicates that they exceed their respective carrying values materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price could result in additional goodwill and intangible impairment losses specifically an unanticipated deterioration in net revenues and operating margins generated by our emeia andor asia pacific segments could trigger future impairment in those segments while we currently believe that our projected results will not result in future impairment a deterioration in results or other factors could trigger a future impairment 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to successfully grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives our sales force and other personnel including the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to sufficiently recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and standards environmental and health and safety we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

we may not have been or we may not at all times be in full compliance with these laws and regulations in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see business  environmental regulation 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

 18 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

as a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions 

since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions 

changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are subject to taxes in ireland the us and numerous other jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including 

   

there are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness 

we have approximately 15 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2017  in addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million  volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable terms on financing in the future a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs and future business opportunities 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 

additionally a portion of our borrowings at december 31 2017  include a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm 

 19 

or variablerate borrowings at december 31 2017  our 15 billion of aggregate debt outstanding includes  691 million  of floatingrate term loans and 800 million  of our fixedrate senior notes we have the ability to incur up to 500 million  of additional floatingrate debt under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we have entered into interest rate swaps for 250 million  of our floatingrate term loans to manage our interest rate risk a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2017  interest expense of approximately 56 million  if the libor or other applicable base rates under our senior unsecured credit facilities increase in the future then the interest on floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense 

risks relating to the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff ingersoll rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified ingersoll rand for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to ingersoll rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the ingersoll rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and ingersoll rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with ingersoll rand ingersoll rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify ingersoll rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ingersoll rand retained further the indemnity from ingersoll rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and ingersoll rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ingersoll rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ingersoll rand has received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under sections 355 and 368a of the internal revenue code the code with the result that ingersoll rand and ingersoll rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling ingersoll rand received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the irs did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution received taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the receipt and effectiveness of the irs ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by ingersoll rand the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we or ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

 20 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

ingersoll rand has received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue ingersoll rand received an opinion from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion was based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an irish resident or holds shares in ingersoll rand in an irish branch or agency or we or ingersoll rand could incur irish tax liabilities 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash however we have opted out of these preemption rights in our articles of association as permitted under irish company law irish law provides that this optout expires after five years unless renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate for instance recent us legislative proposals could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

 21 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders residing in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

at december 31 2017  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  290 million  and  49 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and starts with a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 

 43 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publiclytraded companies and the subject reporting units 

the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 15 for the 2017  goodwill impairment test additionally a 1 increase in the discount rate used or a 1 decrease in the terminal growth rate would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value 

assessing the fair value of our reporting units includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

 other indefinitelived intangible assets   we performed our annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing in 2017  and determined our indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired recoverability of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our trade names the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 



 44 

data depending on the nature of the reserve and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel internal and external consultants and engineers subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity or cash flows for any year 

 we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for our best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 325 million  and 290 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had a sales incentive accrual of 318 million  and 296 million  respectively each of these accruals represents our best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

the tax reform act constitutes a major change to the us tax system the estimated impact of the tax reform act is based on current interpretations and related assumptions as discussed further in note 17 to the consolidated financial 

 45 

statements where applicable we included provisional estimates in our consolidated financial statements for impacts of the new tax reform act the actual impact to us may be materially different from current estimates based on regulatory developments and our further analysis of the impacts of the tax reform act in future periods our effective tax rate could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of regulatory developments 

 we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date 

we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2017  net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 08 million  and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 07 million  a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would have no impact on expense as we have capped the annual maximum amount we will pay for retiree healthcare costs therefore any additional costs would be assumed by the retiree

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2017  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 74 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2017  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities accrue interest at the option of the company at a per annum rate of i a libor rate plus the applicable margin or ii a base rate plus the applicable margin the applicable margin for borrowings under the credit facilities is subject to a ratingsbased pricing grid with the margin ranging from 1125  to 1500  depending on the companys credit ratings outstanding borrowings under the term facility as of december 31 2017 accrue interest at libor plus an applicable margin and expose us to interest rate risks 

the company has entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate paid during the contract period for 250 million  of the companys variable rate term facility these swaps expire in september 2020  a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2017  interest expense of approximately 56 million  if the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future our floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense

access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building and home most door openings are customconfigured to maximize a room’s particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and enduser security needs most buildings have multiple door openings each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific accesscontrol solutions each door must fit exactly within its frame be prepared precisely for its hinges synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door moreover security products are increasingly linked electronically creating additional functionality and complexity 

we believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be customconfigured to meet endusers’ security needs is a key driver of our success we accomplish this with 

 

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately 30 billion in revenue in 2016 with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4 per year over the past four years we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends including 

 

we believe improving institutional and growth in commercial industrial markets and continued recovery in residential markets in the united states and slight growth in europe will offset unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates overseas additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities our acquisition of simons voss technologies gmbh and milre systek co ltd in late 2015 were made to capitalize on this trend 

we operate in three geographic regions americas europe middle east india and africa emeia and asia pacific we sell our products and solutions under the following brands

we sell a wide range of security products and solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential facilities worldwide including into the education healthcare government hospitality commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our corporate brands are cisa® interflex® lcn® schlage® simonsvoss® and von duprin® we believe lcn schlage and von duprin hold the no 1 position in their primary product categories in north america and cisa and interflex hold the no1 or no 2 position in their primary product categories in certain european markets 

  

for the year ended december 31 2016  we generated revenues of 22380 million  and operating income of 4255 million

history and developments 

we were incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 we became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago and many of our brands originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products recent examples of successful product launches are illustrated in the table below 



industry and competition 

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately 30 billion in revenue in 2016  with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4 per year over the past four years this growth rate primarily reflects cyclical challenges in the commercial institutional and residential construction markets throughout north america and europe as certain developing economies experienced higher growth rates during this period additionally growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities we expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab and dormakaba group we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product 

 7 

categories we may also compete against smaller more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain 

our reporting segments 

we manufacture and sell mechanical and electronic security products and solutions in approximately 130 countries approximately 96 of our 2016  revenues were to customers in the north america western europe and the asiapacific regions

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales typically are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however our interflex business typically experiences higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing revenue by quarter for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  are as follows 



employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had more than 9400 employees 

environmental regulation 

we have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities the company regularly evaluates its remediation programs and considers alternative remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those currently utilized by the company based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  233 million   44 million  and 29 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  306 million  and  152 million  of these amounts  96 million  and  28 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain

 item 1a     risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia china europe korea mexico new zealand and turkey the political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business in the us and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin and negatively impact our ability to compete 

our business relies on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in a market that is experiencing the convergence of the mechanical and electronic products this may lead to increased competition including with companies with greater financial and other resources than we have and may lead to changes in customers tastes and preferences to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

 12 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

approximately 30 of our 2016 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

some of the businesses we may seek to acquire or invest in may be marginally profitable or unprofitable for these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration we may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 13 

 

we continually look to expand our services and products into international markets as we expand into new international markets we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets in other instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets certain international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations or effectively compete in new markets we enter any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from core business 

we may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services we can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove to be successful among other negative effects our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital in the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

impact of united kingdom exit from european union 

in 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit there is substantial uncertainty surrounding the brexit vote and any impact of brexit depends on the terms of the uks withdrawal from the eu which still need to be determined and could take several years to accomplish the uks withdrawal from the eu could result in a global economic downturn which could depress the demand for our products and services the uk also could lose access to the single eu market and to the global trade and tax deals negotiated by the eu on behalf of its members depressing trade between the uk and other countries which would negatively impact our international operations additionally we may face new regulations regarding trade security and employees among others in the uk compliance with such regulations could be costly negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition 

our emeia restructuring plans may not be successful 

we have substantially completed a plan to restructure our emeia segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost 

structure if we are unable to successfully maintain our restructuring plan we may not be able to improve profitability 

or effectively compete in the region in addition the previously disclosed plan or any new restructuring plans could result in 

significant restructuring charges and impairment charges 

 14 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business there can be no assurance that our current information technology systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our information technology systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that any newly implemented information technology systems will improve our current systems will improve our operations or will yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented negatively impact our business if our information technology systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on a single vendor for many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure to a thirdparty service provider in order to achieve efficiencies if the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

manmade problems such as cybersecurity attacks computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our business reputation and operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our network and products may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead 

 15 

to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our daily business operations require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals 

our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee errors or other unforeseen activities such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners to the extent that such disruptions occur they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation 

commodity shortages and price increases could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2016  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 7168 million  and 646 million  pursuant to gaap we are required to annually assess our goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired in addition interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments we have significant intangible assets including goodwill with an indefinite life which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in such factors and conditions 

the basis of the fair value for our impairment assessments is determined by projecting future cash flows using assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization although our last analysis regarding the fair values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for our reporting units indicates that they exceed their respective carrying values materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price could result in additional goodwill and intangible impairment losses specifically an unanticipated deterioration in net revenues and operating margins generated by our emeia andor asia pacific segments could trigger future impairment in those segments while we currently believe that our projected results will not result in future impairment a deterioration in results could trigger a future impairment 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to successfully grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives our sales force and other personnel including the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to sufficiently recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

 16 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and standards environmental and health and safety we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

we may not have been or we may not at all times be in full compliance with these laws and regulations in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see business  environmental regulation 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

as a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions 

since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules to the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions 

changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 17 

we are subject to taxes in ireland the us and numerous other jurisdictions due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including 

   

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could harm our business by limiting our available cash and our access to additional capital and to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness exposing us to interest rate risk 

we have approximately 15 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2016  in addition we have a senior secured revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable terms on financing in the future in addition a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs and future business opportunities we may be more vulnerable than a less leveraged company to a downturn in the general economic conditions or in our business or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases as certain of our borrowings including those under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which actions may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness for more information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary financial covenants that may restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales and therefore may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

despite our levels of indebtedness we may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to 500 million if we incur additional debt above the levels we currently have the risks associated with our leverage including those described above would increase 

the terms of our debt covenants could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds 

 18 

the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict us from taking certain actions that we may think are in the best interests of our shareholders a breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans 

these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise additionally our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns and the other factors described in these risk factors 

our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly 

a portion of our borrowings at december 31 2016  include a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings at december 31 2016  we have approximately 15 billion of aggregate debt outstanding and this amount includes 880 million  of floatingrate term loans and 600 million  of our fixedrate senior notes we have the ability to incur up to 500 million of additional floatingrate debt under our senior secured revolving credit facility we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for 2750 million  of our floatingrate term loans to manage our interest rate risk a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2016  interest expense of approximately 62 million  if the libor or other applicable base rates under our senior secured credit facilities increase in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense 

risks relating to the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff ingersoll rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified ingersoll rand for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to ingersoll rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the ingersoll rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and ingersoll rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with ingersoll rand ingersoll rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify ingersoll rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ingersoll rand retained further the indemnity from ingersoll rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and ingersoll rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ingersoll rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ingersoll rand has received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under sections 355 and 368a of the internal revenue code the code with the result that ingersoll rand and ingersoll rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling ingersoll rand received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the irs did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation 

 19 

of the distribution received taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the receipt and effectiveness of the irs ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by ingersoll rand the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we or ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

ingersoll rand has received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue ingersoll rand received an opinion from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion was based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an irish resident or holds shares in ingersoll rand in an irish branch or agency or we or ingersoll rand could incur irish tax liabilities 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

 20 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash however we have opted out of these preemption rights in our articles of association as permitted under irish company law irish law provides that this optout expires after five years unless renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate for instance recent us legislative proposals could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 



 21 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which appears elsewhere in this annual report

trends and economic events 

current market conditions including challenges in international markets continue to impact our financial results uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting our results however us residential and consumer markets have begun to improve and we are seeing improvements in the us new builder and replacement markets 

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately 30 billion in revenue in 2016  with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4 per year over the past four years we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends which include heightened awareness of security requirements increased global urbanization and the shift to a digital interconnected environment 

we believe improving institutional and growth in commercial industrial markets and continued recovery in residential markets in the united states and slight growth in europe will offset unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates overseas additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities our acquisitions of simons voss technologies gmbh and milre systek co ltd in late 2015 were made to capitalize on this trend

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2016  increased 3910 million  compared to the same period in the prior year net repayments of debt totaled 644 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily associated with required amortization payments of our term loan a facility and repayments of other borrowings proceeds from longterm debt were  3000 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  cash used in other financing activities increased 483 million for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher dividend payments and increased repurchases of our ordinary shares partially offset by lower debt issuance costs lower proceeds from shares issued under incentive plans and a reduction in dividends paid to noncontrolling interests 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  increased 3450 million  compared to the same period in the prior year we borrowed 4000 million under the revolver to partially finance the purchases of simons voss and axa in the third quarter of 2015 proceeds from the issuance of our 3000 million 2023 senior notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under the revolver and the remaining borrowings were repaid with cash onhand by december 31 2015  net repayments of other debt totaled 217 million for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily associated with required amortization payments of our term loan a facility cash used in other financing activities increased 113 million for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher dividend payments and higher debt issuance costs partially offset by lower repurchases of our ordinary shares

we are required to comply with certain covenants under our senior secured credit facility we are required to comply with a maximum leverage ratio of 400 to 100 based on a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness net of unrestricted cash up to 150 million to consolidated ebitda additionally we are required to have a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 400 to 100 based on a ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense net of interest income as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with these covenants the indentures to our senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions for further details on these covenants see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

the majority of our earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations accordingly applicable income taxes have not been accrued on the portion of our earnings that is considered to be permanently reinvested at december 31 2016  we had cash and cash equivalents of 3124 million  approximately 48 of our cash and cash equivalents were located outside the us 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis at december 31 2016  the funded status of our qualified pension plan for us employees increased to 736  from 709  at december 31 2015  primarily due to contributions made to the plan in the current year in january 2017 subsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date we made a discretionary 500 million contribution to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan using cash on hand increasing the funded status to 917   the funded status for our nonus pension plans increased to 929  at december 31 2016  from 916  at december 31 2015  funded status for all of our pension plans at december 31 2016  increased to 833  from 817  at december 31 2015  after the discretionary 500 million contribution to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan in january 2017 the funded status for all of our pension plans increased to approximately 90 for further details on pension plan activity see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 

  



future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2016  we had net pension liabilities of 1116 million  which consist of pension plan assets of 5558 million  and pension plan obligations of 6674 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required in january 2017 subsequent to the consolidated balance sheet date we made a discretionary  500 million contribution   to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan using cash on hand after the discretionary 500 million contribution to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan in january 2017 the funded status for all of our pension plans increased to approximately 90 from 833  at december 31 2016  we currently project that an additional approximately 94 million  will be contributed to our plans worldwide in 2017  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2016  we had postretirement benefit obligations of 97 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 09 million  in 2017  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2016  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  320 million  and  54 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from 

 43 

the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test prescribed by gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publiclytraded companies and the subject reporting units 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 for the 2016 goodwill impairment test additionally a 1 increase in the discount rate used or a 1 decrease in the terminal growth rate would not result in any reporting unit failing step 1 

assessing the fair value of goodwill includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

 44 

 other indefinitelived intangible assets   we performed our annual indefinitelived intangible impairment testing in 2016  and determined our indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our trade names the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 



 45 

we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for our best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 290 million  and 245 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had a sales incentive accrual of 296 million  and 266 million  respectively each of these accruals represents our best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date a discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date 

we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2016  net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 08 million  and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 06 million  a 10 increase in the healthcare 

 46 

cost trend rate would have no impact on expense as we have capped the annual maximum amount we will pay for retiree healthcare costs therefore any additional costs would be assumed by the retiree

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 15 herein for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2016  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 121 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2016  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risks a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2016  interest expense of approximately 62 million  

the company has forward starting interest rate swaps to fix interest rate paid during the contract period for 5250 million  of the companys variable rate term loan facility swaps with notional amounts totaling 2750 million  expire in september 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling 2500 million  expire in december 2020 if the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately 30 billion in revenue in 2015 with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4 per year over the past three years we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends including 

 

we believe slowly improving institutional and cautious growth in commercial industrial markets and continued recovery in residential markets in the united states and slight growth in europe will offset unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates overseas additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities two of our acquisitions in 2015 simonsvoss technologies gmbh and milre systek co ltd were made to capitalize on this trend

history and developments 

allegion plc was incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of ingersoll rand plc ingersoll rand on december 1 2013 allegion became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to allegion and the issuance by allegion of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago and many of our brands originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products recent examples of successful product launches are illustrated in the table below 



industry and competition 

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately 30 billion in revenue in 2015 with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4 per year over the past three years this growth rate primarily reflects cyclical challenges in the commercial institutional and residential construction markets throughout north america and europe as certain developing economies experienced higher growth rates during this period additionally growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities 

 6 

we expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab dormakaba group and stanley black  decker inc we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against smaller more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain 

our reporting segments 

we manufacture and sell mechanical and electronic security products and solutions in approximately 130 countries approximately 95 of our 2015 revenues were to customers in the north america western europe and the asiapacific regions

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales typically are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however our interflex business typically experiences higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing revenue by quarter for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  are as follows 



2015 fourth quarter revenue includes the fullquarter impact of the acquisitions of simonsvoss axa and milre 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had more than 9400 employees approximately 26 of whom have the terms of their employment covered under collective bargaining agreements this includes nonmanagement european employees who are represented by national and local works councils 

environmental regulation 

we have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  44 million   29 million  and 21 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  152 million  and  88 million  of these amounts  28 million  and  24 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain

 item 1a     risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us and our ordinary shares if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in australia china europe korea mexico new zealand and turkey accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations and limit our ability to sell products in certain markets 

our business relies on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in a market that is experiencing the convergence of the mechanical and electronic products this may lead to increased competition including with companies with greater financial and other resources than we have to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

 11 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

approximately 30 of our 2015 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

we may also expand through acquisitions or investments into international markets in which we may have limited experience or are required to rely on business partners in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares 

 12 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations or effectively compete in new markets we enter any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

our emeia restructuring plans may not be successful 

we have implemented a plan to restructure our emeia segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost structure if we are unable to successfully implement our restructuring plan we may not be able to improve profitability or effectively compete in the region in addition our restructuring plans could result in significant restructuring charges and impairment charges 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

 13 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business there can be no assurance that our current information technology systems will function properly we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our information technology systems some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures there is no assurance that any newly implemented information technology systems will improve our current systems will improve our operations or will yield the expected returns on the investments in addition the implementation of new information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented negatively impact our business if our information technology systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on a single vendor for many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure to a thirdparty service provider in order to achieve efficiencies if the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

our information technology infrastructure is important to our business and data security breaches or disruptions of such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology infrastructure is subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized security intrusions despite instituting security policies and business continuity plans our systems and networks may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation 

commodity shortages and price increases could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2015  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 7141 million  and 621 million  in accordance with gaap we periodically assess these assets to determine whether they are impaired negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected changes or planned changes in use of assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to successfully grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives our sales force and other personnel including the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

 14 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and standards environmental and health and safety we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

we may not have been or we may not at all times be in full compliance with these laws and regulations in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see “business  environmental regulation” 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

we may not be able to sustain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in future years because of among other things uncertainty regarding the geographic mix of income and the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could harm our business by limiting our available cash and our access to additional capital and to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness exposing us to interest rate risk 

we have approximately 15 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2015  in addition we have a senior secured revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million volatility in the credit markets could adversely 

 15 

impact our ability to obtain favorable terms on financing in the future in addition a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs and future business opportunities we may be more vulnerable than a less leveraged company to a downturn in the general economic conditions or in our business or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases as certain of our borrowings including those under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which actions may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness for more information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary financial covenants that may restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales and therefore may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

despite our levels of indebtedness we may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to 500 million if we incur additional debt above the levels we currently have the risks associated with our leverage including those described above would increase 

the terms of our debt covenants could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds 

the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict us from taking certain actions that we may think are in the best interests of our shareholders a breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans 

these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise additionally our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns and the other factors described in these “risk factors” 

our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly 

a portion of our borrowings at december 31 2015  include a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings at december 31 2015  we have approximately 15 billion of aggregate debt outstanding and this amount includes 927 million  of floatingrate term loans and 600 million  of our fixedrate senior notes we have the ability to incur up 

 16 

to 500 million of additional floatingrate debt under our senior secured revolving credit facility we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for 3000 million  of our floatingrate term loans to manage our interest rate risk a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2015  interest expense of approximately 65 million  if the libor or other applicable base rates under our senior secured credit facilities increase in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense 

risks relating to the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff ingersoll rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified ingersoll rand for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to ingersoll rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the ingersoll rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and ingersoll rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with ingersoll rand ingersoll rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify ingersoll rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ingersoll rand retained further the indemnity from ingersoll rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and ingersoll rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ingersoll rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ingersoll rand has received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under sections 355 and 368a of the internal revenue code the code with the result that ingersoll rand and ingersoll rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling ingersoll rand received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the irs did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution received taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the receipt and effectiveness of the irs ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by ingersoll rand the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we or ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

 17 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

ingersoll rand has received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue ingersoll rand received an opinion from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion was based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an irish resident or holds shares in ingersoll rand in an irish branch or agency or we or ingersoll rand could incur irish tax liabilities 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash however we have opted out of these preemption rights in our articles of association as permitted under irish company law irish law provides that this optout expires after five years unless renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate for instance recent us legislative proposals could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

 18 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable

we are a leading global provider of security products and solutions operating in three geographic regions americas emeia and asia pacific we sell a wide range of security products and solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential markets worldwide including into the education healthcare government commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our corporate brands include schlage von duprin lcn cisa interflex and simonsvoss 

trends and economic events 

current market conditions including challenges in international markets continue to impact our financial results uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting our results however us residential and consumer markets have begun to improve and we are seeing improvements in the us new builder and replacement markets 

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately 30 billion in revenue in 2015 with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4 per year over the past three years we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends which include heightened awareness of security requirements increased global urbanization and the shift to a digital interconnected environmentwe believe slowly improving institutional and cautious growth in commercial industrial markets and continued recovery in residential markets in the united states and slight growth in europe will offset unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates overseas additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities two of our acquisitions in 2015 simonsvoss technologies gmbh and milre systek co ltd were made to capitalize on this trend

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service any future debt pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash provided by operating activities and to access our borrowing facilities including unused availability under our revolver and capital markets we believe that our future cash provided by operating activities availability under our revolver and access to funds on hand and capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 for additional details please see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 

 37 



operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased 16 million  compared to the same period in 2014 operating cash flows for 2015 reflect lower earnings from continuing operations compared to the same period in the prior year as well as increased use of working capital 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014  increased 297 million  compared to the same period in 2013 operating cash flows for 2014 reflect higher earnings from continuing operations compared to the same period in 2013 as well as lower working capital 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  increased 4990 million  compared to the same period in the prior year during the year ended december 31 2015  we paid 5113 million  of cash for the acquisitions described above this was offset by a decrease in capital expenditures and cash received from the sale of marketable securities 

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  increased 161 million  compared to the same period in 2013 cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  included 515 million of capital expenditures an increase of 313 million from 2013 as we invested in information technology systems new product development and manufacturing plant investments to support our growth initiatives in addition we spent 252 million of cash for acquisitions in 2014 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  increased 3450 million  compared to the same period in the prior year we borrowed 4000 million under the revolver to partially finance the purchases of simons voss and axa in the third quarter of 2015 net proceeds from the issuance of our 3000 million 2023 senior notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under the revolver and the remaining borrowings were repaid with cash onhand by december 31 2015  net repayments of other debt totaled 217 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  primarily associated with required amortization payments of our term loan a facility cash used in other financing activities increased 113 million for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher dividend payments and higher debt issuance costs partially offset by lower repurchases of our ordinary shares 

net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased 1424 million  compared to the same period in 2013 in the 2013 13000 million of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities as well as additional cash generated throughout the year were distributed to ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff net of debt issuance costs in 2014 we made 372 million net repayments on the senior secured credit facilities and 408 million of repayments of other borrowings we paid 300 million of dividends to our ordinary shareholders and we repurchased 503 million of our ordinary shares

capitalization 

borrowings at december 31 consisted of the following 



the term loan facility amortizes in quarterly installments at the following rates per year 5 in 2016 5 in 2017 5 in 2018 and 10 in each year thereafter with the final installment due on october 15 2020 we repaid 361 million  on the term loan facility as of the year ended december 31 2015  the 2021 senior notes are due in full on october 1 2021 and the 2023 senior notes are due in full on september 15 2023 

we have a 5year 5000 million revolving credit facility maturing on october 15 2020 during august 2015 we borrowed 4000 million under the revolver and repaid the borrowed amount in full as of the year ended december 31 2015  at december 31 2015  and 2014  we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolver we had 266 million  and 285 million of letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively which reduce availability under the revolver 

we are required to comply with certain covenants under our senior secured credit facility we are required to comply with a maximum leverage ratio of 400 to 100 based on a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness net of unrestricted cash up to 150 million to consolidated ebitda additionally we are required to have a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 400 to 100 based on a ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense net of interest income as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with these covenants the indentures to our senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions for further details on these covenants see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

the majority of our earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations accordingly applicable income taxes have not been accrued on the portion of our earnings that is considered to be permanently reinvested at december 31 2015  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1997 million  approximately 62 of our cash and cash equivalents was located outside the us 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis in december 31 2015  the funded status of our qualified pension plan for us employees declined to 709 from 776 at december 31 2014  primarily due to benefit accruals in excess of contributions the funded status for our nonus pension plans decreased to 916  at december 31 2015  from 958  at december 31 2014  the decrease in funded status for the nonus was primarily due to benefit accruals in excess of contributions funded status for all of our pension plans at december 31 2015  decreased to 817  from 872  at december 31 2014  for further details on pension plan activity see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 

  



future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2015  we had net pension liabilities of 1193 million  which consist of pension plan assets of 5331 million  and pension plan obligations of 6524 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately 108 million  to our plans worldwide in 2016  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2015  we had postretirement benefit obligations of 129 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 11 million  in 2016  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2015  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  238 million  and  53 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

 40 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test prescribed by gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being weighted in the calculation the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publiclytraded companies and the subject reporting units 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 for the 2015 goodwill impairment test additionally a 1 increase in the discount rate used or a 1 decrease in the terminal growth rate would not result in any reporting unit failing step 1 

assessing the fair value of goodwill includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

  41 

 2013 goodwill impairment test  in the third quarter of 2013 we determined that we were required to complete the first step of the twostep impairment test the results of our impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our emeia reporting unit was less than its carrying value consequently we performed the second step of the impairment test to quantify the amount of the noncash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of 1376 million 1312 million aftertax this charge had no impact on our cash flows or our compliance with debt covenants for our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2013 the fair value of our emeia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 24 

during 2013 we renegotiated a significant joint venture contract within our asia pacific  other reporting unit and moved the related product line to our americas segment as a result of these business changes we completed the first step of the twostep impairment test 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   we performed our annual indefinitelived intangible impairment testing in 2015 and determined our indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired all indefinitelived intangible assets had a fair value that exceeded their carrying value by more than 15 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our trade names the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows

received delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership service and installation revenue are recognized when earned in some instances customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order in these instances revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied if uncertainty exists about customer acceptance revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred 

we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for our best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 245 million  and 235 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had a sales incentive accrual of 266 million  and 232 million  respectively each of these accruals represents our best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

 we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date a discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date 

 43 

we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2015  net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 07 million  and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 05 million  a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would have no impact on expense as we have capped the annual maximum amount we will pay for retiree healthcare costs therefore any additional costs would be assumed by the retiree

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level however we do not hedge currency translation risk we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2015  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 159 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2015  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risks a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2015  interest expense of approximately 65 million  

 44 

in june 2014 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for 3000 million  of our variable rate term loan a facility swaps with notional amounts totaling 2750 million  effective january 2015 expire in september 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling 250 million  effective january 2015 expire in december 2016 if the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense

based on information derived from third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than 30 billion in revenue in 2014 comprised of 25 billion for mechanical hardware and electronic security products and more than 5 billion for time attendance and workforce productivity systems and systems integration we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends including 

 

in the more established economies of north america and europe the security products industry’s compound annual growth rate was 1 to 2 per year due to uneven economic conditions experienced over the past three years we believe our markets are poised for a cyclical recovery driven in part by accelerating growth in the underlying commercial and residential construction markets and improved consumer confidence in the united states offsetting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities 

we operate in three geographic regions americas europe middle east india and africa emeia and asia pacific we sell our products and solutions under the following brands

for the year ended december 31 2014  we generated revenues of 21183 million  and operating income of 3263 million  



history and developments 

allegion plc was incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold ingersoll rand’s commercial and residential security businesses on december 1 2013 allegion became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to allegion and the issuance by allegion of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago and many of our brands originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products recent examples include schlage nde series wireless commercial lock with the engage connectivity platform schlage touchscreen deadbolt a residential lock cisa esigno a hotel locking platform evayo a european electronics security platform von duprin concealed vertical cable system that significantly reduces total installation time and ongoing maintenance requirements aptiq a versatile and multitechnology card reader platform and schlage’s adco an electronic locking platform that allows endusers to add additional features without lock replacement 

industry and competition 

based on third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than 31 billion in revenue in 2014 comprised of 26 billion for mechanical hardware and electronic security products and more than 5 billion for time attendance and workforce productivity systems and systems integration with compound annual growth of about 1 to 2 per year over the past three years this growth rate primarily reflects cyclical challenges in the commercial and residential construction markets throughout north america and europe as certain developing economies experienced higher growth rates during this period additionally growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities we expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm

demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab dorma holding gmbh kaba holding ag and stanley black  decker inc we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against smaller more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain

we concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions and also on driving continuous improvements in product cost quality safety and sustainability 

 8 

we manage our rd team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms we are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations in addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region we also operate a global engineering center of excellence in bangalore india 

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales typically are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however our interflex and asia pacific systems integration businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing revenue by quarter for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 are as follows 



employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had more than 8500 employees approximately 20 of whom have the terms of their employment covered under collective bargaining agreements our nonmanagement european employees are represented by national and local works councils 

environmental regulation 

we are dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency the epa and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  29 million   21 million  and 29 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  88 million  and  108 million  respectively of these amounts  24 million  and  29 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain

 item 1a     risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us and our ordinary shares if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in europe china australia mexico venezuela and turkey accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations and limit our ability to sell products in certain markets 

our business relies on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

we operate in highly competitive markets 

the markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies we primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise breadth of product offering and price we may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases if we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors’ activities and initiatives the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted 

in addition we compete in a market that is experiencing the convergence of the mechanical and electronic products this may lead to increased competition including with companies with greater financial and other resources than we have to remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner 

 10 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of combined net sales in the past three fiscal years the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

approximately 37 of our 2014 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our combined and consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

  11 

 

we may also expand through acquisitions or investments into international markets in which we may have limited experience or are required to rely on business partners in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations or effectively compete in new markets we enter any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

our emeia restructuring plans may not be successful 

we have implemented a plan to restructure our emeia segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost structure if we are unable to successfully implement our restructuring plan we may not be able to improve profitability or effectively compete in the region in addition our restructuring plans could result in significant restructuring charges and impairment charges 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

 12 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business if these systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on a single vendor for many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure to a thirdparty service provider in order to achieve efficiencies if the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

our information technology infrastructure is important to our business and data security breaches or disruptions of such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology infrastructure is subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized security intrusions despite instituting security policies and business continuity plans our systems and networks may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation 

commodity shortages and price increases could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual and multiyear fixed price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2014 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 506 million and 101 million respectively in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we periodically assess these assets to determine whether they are impaired negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected changes or planned changes in use of assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to successfully grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives our sales force and other personnel including the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and standards environmental and health and safety we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply 

 13 

with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

we may not have been or we may not at all times be in full compliance with these laws and regulations in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the epa and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see “business  environmental regulation” 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

we may not be able to sustain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in future years because of among other things uncertainty regarding the geographic mix of income and the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

our operations in venezuela expose us to several risks 

venezuela is currently experiencing significant political and civil unrest and economic instability and in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar we recognized a 62 million realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation in the first quarter of 2013 in march 2014 the venezuelan government launched a sicad ii rate to provide a greater supply of us dollars from sources other than the venezuelan government all companies located or domiciled in venezuela may bid for usd for any purpose the sicad ii exchange rate was approximately 50 bolivars per us dollar on december 31 2014 

given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future we concluded that the sicad ii exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities as a result on december 31 2014 we moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the sicad ii rate we recorded a charge of 454 million before tax and noncontrolling interest or 028 per diluted share the charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets 121 million and a noncash impairment 

 14 

charge to adjust venezuelan inventory balances 333 million after these charges we had 46 million of bolivardenominated net monetary assets and 89 million of inventory in venezuela as of december 31 2014 

on february 9 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new marketbased system called the marginal currency system or “simadi” that will replace the sicad ii rate the company is currently evaluating this announcement adoption of the simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets 

this current state of affairs could lead to further devaluation of venezuelas currency volatility of exchange rates and disruption of the economy if the current unrest and instability continues our ability to acquire necessary goods from suppliers could be limited our customers may not be able to fulfill their obligations our ability to manufacture and sell products could be disrupted and our venezuelan operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could harm our business by limiting our available cash and our access to additional capital and to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness exposing us to interest rate risk 

we have approximately 13 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2014 in addition we have a senior secured revolving credit facility permitting borrowings of up to 500 million further volatility in the credit markets would adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable terms on financing in the future in addition a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs and future business opportunities we may be more vulnerable than a less leveraged company to a downturn in the general economic conditions or in our business or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases as certain of our borrowings including those under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which actions may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness for more information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain customary financial covenants that may restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

despite our levels of indebtedness we may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain customary restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to 500 million if we incur additional debt above the levels we currently have the risks associated with our leverage including those described above would increase 

 15 

the terms of our debt covenants could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds 

the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict us from taking certain actions that we may think are in the best interests of our shareholders a breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans 

these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise additionally our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns and the other factors described in these “risk factors” 

our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly 

a portion of our borrowings at december 31 2014 is a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings at december 31 2014 we have approximately 13 billion of aggregate debt outstanding and this amount includes 963 million of floatingrate term loans and 300 million of our fixedrate senior notes we have the ability to incur up to 500 million of additional floatingrate debt under our senior secured revolving credit facility a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2014 interest expense of approximately 70 million excluding the impact of our forward starting interest rate swaps in june 2014 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for 3000 million  of our floatingrate term loans swaps with notional amounts totaling 2750 million  become effective in january 2015 and expire in september 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling 250 million  become effective in january 2015 and expire in december 2016 if the libor or other applicable base rates under our senior secured credit facilities increase in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense 

risks relating to the spinoff 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our spinoff from ingersoll rand 

as an independent publiclytraded company we believe that our business will benefit from among other things allowing us to better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business allowing our board of directors and management to design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the characteristics of our business allowing us to more effectively respond to industry dynamics and allowing the creation of effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance however we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect if at all 

we may be unable to make on a timely or costeffective basis the changes necessary to operate as an independent company and we may experience increased costs 

prior to 2014 we operated as part of ingersoll rand’s corporate organization and ingersoll rand has assisted us by providing certain corporate functions ingersoll rand is obligated contractually to provide to us only those transition services specified in agreements we entered into with ingersoll rand we may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms the services or other benefits that ingersoll rand previously provided to us that are not specified in any transition services agreement upon expiration of any transition services agreement each of the services that are covered in the agreement will have to be provided internally or by third parties and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms in addition if ingersoll rand does not continue to perform transition services and the other services that are called for under any transition services agreement we may not be able to operate our business as effectively 

 16 

our historical combined financial data are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical data prior to our spinoff from ingersoll rand presented herein may not reflect what our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been an independent publiclytraded company during the periods presented or what our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be in the future as an independent company this is primarily because 

 

we may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements related to the spinoff 

the agreements related to the spinoff including the separation and distribution agreement employee matters agreement tax matters agreement transition services agreement agreements with respect to real estate and intellectual property matters and any other agreements were negotiated in the context of the spinoff from ingersoll rand while we were still part of ingersoll rand accordingly these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’slength negotiations among unaffiliated third parties the terms of the agreements in the context of the spinoff are related to among other things allocations of assets liabilities rights indemnifications and other obligations among ingersoll rand and us we might have received better terms under the agreements relating to the spinoff had they been negotiated with disinterested third parties who competed with each other to win our business than we received from ingersoll rand 

in connection with the spinoff ingersoll rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified ingersoll rand for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to ingersoll rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the ingersoll rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and ingersoll rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with ingersoll rand ingersoll rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify ingersoll rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ingersoll rand retained further the indemnity from ingersoll rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and ingersoll rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ingersoll rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ingersoll rand has received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under sections 355 and 368a of the internal revenue code the code with the result that ingersoll rand and ingersoll rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs

ruling the irs ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling ingersoll rand received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the irs did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution received taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the receipt and effectiveness of the irs ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by ingersoll rand the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we or ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

in addition the amount of our shares that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our shares may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for ingersoll rand under section 355e of the code and under the tax matters agreement we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for that tax 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the distribution because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the distribution in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution by ingersoll rand even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in a corporatelevel taxable gain to ingersoll rand and certain of its affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or ingersoll rand’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or ingersoll rand’s shares within two years after the distribution will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan although we or ingersoll rand may be able to rebut that presumption 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to ingersoll rand of the distribution under the tax matters agreement we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree further for the twoyear period following the distribution without obtaining the consent of ingersoll rand a private letter ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion from a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm we are prohibited from among other things 

 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the tax matters agreement provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on ingersoll rand or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code unless such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distribution by ingersoll rand 

in february 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of our ordinary shares due to these restrictions we may not engage in privately negotiated transactions or acquire more than 20 of our outstanding shares within 

 18 

two years after the distribution we believe that we will be able to execute the authorized share repurchases and preserve the taxfree treatment of the distribution however if we are unable to preserve the taxfree treatment any taxes imposed on us could be significant 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

ingersoll rand has received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue ingersoll rand received an opinion from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion was based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an irish resident or holds shares in ingersoll rand in an irish branch or agency or we or ingersoll rand could incur irish tax liabilities 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash however we have opted out of these preemption rights in our articles of association as permitted under irish company law irish law provides that this optout expires after five years unless renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate for instance recent us legislative proposals could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have 

 19 

a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

 20 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 

moreover an acquisition or further issuance of our ordinary shares after the spinoff could trigger the application of section 355e of the code even if the distribution and certain related transactions undertaken in connection therewith otherwise qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355e of the code we andor ingersoll rand could incur tax upon certain transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution if 50 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares or ingersoll rand ordinary shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff the process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex inherently factual and subject to interpretation any acquisitions or issuances of our ordinary shares or ingersoll rand ordinary shares within two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or ingersoll rand as applicable may be able to rebut that presumption moreover under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with ingersoll rand we are restricted from engaging in certain transactions within two years of the distribution which potentially could trigger application of section 355e of the code during such period these restrictions may limit the ability that we or a potential acquirer of allegion have to pursue certain strategic transactions that might increase the value of our ordinary shares

 item 7    management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information including our combined and consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which appears elsewhere in this annual report 

overview 

organization 

we are a leading global provider of security products and solutions operating in three geographic regions americas emeia and asia pacific we sell a wide range of security products and solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential markets worldwide including into the education healthcare government commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our strategic brands include schlage von duprin lcn cisa and interflex 

trends and economic events 

current market conditions including challenges in international markets continue to impact our financial results uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting our results however us residential and consumer markets have begun to improve and we are seeing improvements in the us new builder and replacement markets 

based on information derived from third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than 30 billion in revenue in 2014 comprised of 25 billion for mechanical hardware products and more than 5 billion for time attendance and workforce productivity systems and systems integration we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends which include heightened awareness of security requirements increased global urbanization and the shift to a digital interconnected environment in the more established economies of north america and europe where the security product industry’s compound annual growth rate was 1 to 2 per year during the uneven economic conditions experienced over the past three years we believe our markets are poised for a cyclical recovery driven in part by accelerating growth in the underlying commercial and residential construction markets and improved consumer confidence in the united states offsetting currency headwinds overseas additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to continue to outperform the industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities 

the economic conditions discussed above and a number of other challenges and uncertainties that could affect our business are described under “risk factors” 

2014 significant events 

venezuela currency devaluation 

venezuela is treated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated joint venture in venezuela any currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings 

the venezuelan government’s official exchange rate is currently 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar the venezuelan government reinstituted a secondary exchange rate sicad i rate for select goods and services the sicad i rate was 12 bolivars per us dollar at december 31 2014 in march 2014 the venezuelan government launched a sicad ii rate to provide a greater supply of usd from sources other than the venezuelan government all companies located or domiciled in venezuela may bid for usd for any purpose the sicad ii exchange rate was approximately 50 bolivars per us dollar on december 31 2014 

given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future we concluded that the sicad ii exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities as a result on december 31 2014 we moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the sicad ii rate we recorded a charge of 454 million before tax and noncontrolling interest or 028 per diluted share the charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets 121 million and a noncash impairment 

 26 

charge to adjust venezuelan inventory balances 333 million had the sicad ii rate been applied throughout all of 2014 we estimate it would have reduced fullyear revenues and eps by approximately 95 million and 011 per share respectively after these charges we had 46 million of bolivardenominated net monetary assets and 89 million of inventory in venezuela as of december 31 2014 

on february 9 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new marketbased system called the marginal currency system or “simadi” that will replace the sicad ii rate the company is currently evaluating this announcement adoption of the simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets 

inventory accounting methodology 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we elected to change our method of accounting for certain inventory from the lastinfirstout lifomethod to the firstinfirstout fifo method and now all inventory is accounted for using the fifo method we applied this change in method of inventory accounting by retrospectively adjusting the prior period financial statements further details about the impact of this change are discussed in note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements 

acquisitions 

in january 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain assets of schlage lock de colombia sa the second largest mechanical lock manufacturer in colombia in april 2014 we completed the acquisition of fire  security hardware pty limited fsh an electromechanical locking provider in australia total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately 230 million 

2014 dividends 

we paid quarterly dividends of 008 per ordinary share to shareholders on march 31 2014 june 30 2014 september 30 2014 and december 30 2014 we paid a total of 300 million in cash for dividends to ordinary shareholders during the year ended december 31 2014 

spinoff related charges 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we incurred 286 million of separation costs associated with the spinoff from ingersoll rand of which 282 million was recognized in selling and administrative expenses in our results of operations and 04 million was recognized in cost of goods sold separation costs for the year ended december 31 2014 primarily include professional and consulting fees system implementation costs and relocation and other personnel related costs we do not expect separation costs incurred in 2015 to be material the components of separation costs incurred for the year ended december 31 2014 are presented below in millions 



restructuring charges 

in the second quarter of 2014 management committed to a plan to restructure our emeia segment to improve efficiencies and regional cost structure in conjunction with this plan we incurred severance and other restructuring charges of 61 million and other charges of 04 million  for the year ended december 31 2014 

joint venture order flow change 

previously our consolidated joint venture in asia acted as a passthrough to the end customer beginning in 2013 the consolidated joint venture no longer recognizes the revenue and cost of goods sold on these products because of a revised joint venture operating agreement products are shipped direct to the end customer with the joint venture receiving a royalty in an amount that approximates the lost margin we recognized revenue of approximately 520 million related to this business in our americas segment for the 

 27 

year ended december 31 2013 the change did not have a material impact on operating income or on cash flows for the year ended december 31 2014 

discontinued operations 

in the second quarter of 2014 management committed to a plan to sell its united kingdom uk door businesses to an unrelated third party the transaction closed in the third quarter of 2014 the businesses sold included the doromatic branded automatic door business the martin roberts branded performance steel doorset business and the uk service organization historical results of the component have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in conjunction with the sale we recorded a 76 million charge to write the carrying value of the assets sold down to their selling value

net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  increased by 24   487 million  compared to the same period in 2013  due to the following 

  



the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by improved pricing higher volumes the acquisition of the schlage de colombia assets in january 2014 and the acquisition of fsh in april 2014 the pricing improvements were primarily driven by our consolidated joint venture in venezuela and were largely offset by material inflation and other inflation in venezuela these increases were partially offset by the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in asia discussed above 

 29 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased by 23   463 million  compared to the same period in 2012  due to the following 



the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by improved pricing across all segments as well as increased volumes in the americas segment due to stronger demand in both the commercial and residential markets as well as new products particularly from our electronics portfolio these increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts lower volume in emeia due to weak markets and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in asia discussed above

for the year ended december 31 2014  cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 597  from 584  costs of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 increased primarily due to a 333 million noncash inventory impairment charge related to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar 16 discussed above unfavorable channelregion mix offset by volume 03 and increased investmentsother items 02 these increases were partially offset by productivity benefits and pricing improvements in excess of inflation 06 and the impact of foreign currency movements 02

for the year ended december 31 2014  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 249  from 233  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 was negatively impacted by increased restructuring charges 02 separation costs incurred in connection with the spinoff 12 increased investments 10 the impact of the change in the order flow through our consolidated joint venture in asia discussed above 08 and other inflation in excess of productivity 03 these increases were partially offset by favorable volume leverage 09 

for the year ended december 31 2013  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 233  from 225  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was negatively impacted by a 32 million increase in restructuring charges and nonrecurring separation costs incurred in connection with the spinoff 01 inflation in excess of productivity benefits and other items 03 and increased investment spending 04

operating margin for the year ended december 31 2014  increased to 154  from 116  for the same period in 2013  the increase was primarily due to the 2013 goodwill impairment charge discussed above 67 pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation 15 favorable volumeproduct mix 05 and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 01 these increases were partially offset by the 2014 noncash inventory impairment discussed above 16 increased nonrecurring separation costs and restructuring charges 12 incremental investment spending primarily associated with new product development and other items 14 and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in asia and the 2013 gain on sale of a property in china discussed above 08 

 30 

operating income for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased 1305 million from the same period in 2012 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to a 1376 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2013 increased investment spending 124 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 55 million and increased restructuring charges and nonrecurring separation costs incurred in connection with the spinoff 99 million these decreases were partially offset by the gain on a property sale in china 215 million pricing improvements and productivity in excess of inflation 99 million and increased volume 35 million

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014  increased  436 million  compared to the same period in 2013  as a result of the full year impact resulting from entering into 1000 million senior secured credit facilities and issuing 300 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the spinoff from ingersoll rand in the fourth quarter of 2014 we incurred a noncash charge of approximately 45 million for the writeoff of unamortized term loan b facility debt issuance costs 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  increased  87 million  compared with the same period of 2012  due to the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the spinoff from ingersoll rand 

other expense net 

the components of other expense net for the year ended december 31  are as follows 

  



for the year ended december 31 2014  other expense net decreased by  26 million  compared to the same period in 2013  as discussed above in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded a 121 million loss related to write down our venezuelan bolivardenominated net monetary assets this loss is reflected as exchange loss in the table above in the prior year we recorded a 62 million loss resulting from the official devaluation of the bolivar from 43 bolivars per us dollar to 63 bolivars per us dollar the remaining decrease in other expense net for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to other foreign currency gains in 2014 

for the year ended december 31 2013  other expense net decreased by 39 million compared with the same period in 2012  primarily from unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

provision for income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our effective tax rate of 314  compared to 783  for the year ended december 31 2013  the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 included the impact of a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of 1376 million 1312 million aftertax additionally the effective tax rate included 448 million of discrete tax adjustments consisting of 315 million of expense related to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized and 133 million of net tax expense resulting primarily from transactions occurring to effect the spinoff excluding these items the effective tax rate was 378 the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of pretax income earned in lower rate jurisdictions as well as favorable discrete tax benefits 

our 2013 tax rate was above the us statutory rate of 350  primarily due to us state and local taxes and net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate had a lower effective rate 

 31 

for periods prior to the spinoff income tax expense was recorded as if we filed tax returns on a standalone basis this separate return methodology applied the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a standalone enterprise for the periods prior to the spinoff using statutory rates these rates did not contemplate certain tax strategies that could lower the effective tax rate in future periods if executed 

discontinued operations 

emeia divestiture 

as discussed above in 2014 we sold our uk door businesses to an unrelated third party historical results of the component have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in conjunction with the sale we recorded a 76 million charge to write the carrying value of the assets sold down to their selling value

other divestitures 

other discontinued operations recognized a loss of 04 million  08 million  and 27 million  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively these losses were mainly related to lease expense and other miscellaneous expenses from previously sold businesses 

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues 

the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations effective january 1 2013 we transferred a product line from our asia pacific segment to our americas segment this transfer is reflected in the historical segment results for each of the fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to service any future debt pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash provided by operating activities and to access our borrowing facilities including unused availability under our revolver and capital markets we believe that our future cash provided by operating activities together with our access to funds on hand and capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows in the combined and consolidated financial statements

 37 

to enter into certain transactions for further details on these covenants see note 8 to the combined and consolidated financial statements 

the majority of our earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in jurisdictions where we have made and intend to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations accordingly applicable income taxes have not been accrued on the portion of our earnings that is considered to be permanently reinvested at december 31 2014  we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 2905 million  approximately 55 of our cash and cash equivalents was located outside the us included in our cash and cash equivalents located outside the us is approximately 50 million of cash in china approximately 49 of which will be distributed to a joint venture partner in asia when we receive regulatory approval for the distribution we have provided for income taxes on the 51 of cash that we will retain we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate any other funds located outside the us however repatriation of these funds would expose us to additional taxes 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets as the funded status increases we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis in december 31 2014  the funded status of our qualified pension plan for us employees declined to 754 from 901 at december 31 2013  as a decline in discount rates and the adoption of revised mortality tables increased pension benefit obligations by approximately 601 million the increase in benefit obligations was partially offset by 319 million of pension asset returns the funded status for our nonus pension plans increased to 958 at december 31 2014  from 848 at december 31 2013  the increase in funded status for the nonus was due to asset returns and employer contributions more than offset an increase in pension benefit obligations resulting from a decline in discount rates funded status for all of our pension plans at december 31 2014  increased to 871 from 868 at december 31 2013  for further details on pension plan activity see note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 

  



future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2014  we had net obligations of 861 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of 5852 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of 6713 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately 50 million to our plans worldwide in 2015  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 38 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2014  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  136 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 10 million  in 2015  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2014  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  254 million  and  62 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 16 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and tax authority disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 20 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined and consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test prescribed by gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation we believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the 

 39 

market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publiclytraded companies and the subject reporting units 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2014 goodwill impairment test 

the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 for the 2014 goodwill impairment test additionally a 1 increase in the discount rate used or a 1 decrease in the terminal growth rate would not result in any reporting unit failing step 1 

assessing the fair value of goodwill includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

 2013 goodwill impairment test 

in the third quarter of 2013 we determined that we were required to complete the first step of the twostep impairment test under the income approach we assumed a discount rate of 110 near term growth rates ranging from 25 to 46 and a terminal growth rate of 25 under the market approach we assumed a weighted average multiple of 89 and 80 times projected 2013 and 2014 ebitda respectively and a multiple of 07 and 06 times projected 2013 and 2014 revenue respectively based on industry market data the results of our impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our emeia reporting unit was less than its carrying value consequently we performed the second step of the impairment test to quantify the amount of the noncash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a noncash 

 40 

pretax goodwill impairment charge of 1376 million 1312 million aftertax this charge had no impact on our cash flows or our compliance with debt covenants for our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2013 the fair value of our emeia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 24 

during 2013 we renegotiated a significant joint venture contract within our asia pacific  other reporting unit and moved the related product line to our americas segment as a result of these business changes we completed the first step of the twostep impairment test this reporting unit has goodwill of approximately 57 million 

our asia pacific  other reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 as of october 1 2013 we have provided below key assumptions and a sensitivity analysis under the income approach we assumed a weighted average discount rate of 130 near term growth rates ranging from 13 to 159 and a terminal growth rate of 40 under the market approach we assumed a weighted average implied multiple of 09 and 105 times projected 2013 revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda respectively based on industry market data holding other assumptions constant a 10 increase in the discount rate would result in a 78 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit a 10 decrease in the longterm growth rate would result in a 55 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit either of these scenarios individually would result in the reporting unit failing step 1 which would lead to any or all of the reporting units 57 million of goodwill to be impaired 

other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with a discount rate of 110 a terminal growth rate of 25 and a royalty rate of 50 all indefinitelived intangible assets had a fair value that exceeded their carrying value by more than 15 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows

we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for our best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2014  and 2013  we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 235 million  and 219 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2014  and 2013  we had a sales incentive accrual of 232 million  and 210 million  respectively each of these accruals represents our best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements 

we provide equipment integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2014 all recorded accounts receivables are due within one year we reevaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued and losses are recognized in current period earnings 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable we primarily utilize vsoe to determine its relative selling price we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved

 we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate the discount rate the rate of compensation increase and the expected longterm rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date a discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated aa quality spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments the rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy the types of assets held and the target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return is determined as of each measurement date 

we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors 

changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost estimated sensitivities to the expected 2014 net periodic pension cost of a 025 rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately 09 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately 05 million a 10 increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the cost by approximately 01 million  

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to our combined and consolidated financial statements included in item 15 herein for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the legal entity level we attempt to hedge exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2014  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an additional unrealized loss of approximately 39 million this amount when realized would be partially offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions

venezuela is treated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated joint venture in venezuela any currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings 

the venezuelan government’s official exchange rate is currently 63 venezuelan bolivars per us dollar the venezuelan government reinstituted a secondary exchange rate sicad i rate for select goods and services the sicad i rate was 12 bolivars per us dollar at december 31 2014 in march 2014 the venezuelan government launched a sicad ii rate to provide a greater supply of us dollar from sources other than the venezuelan government all companies located or domiciled in venezuela may bid for us dollar for any purpose the sicad ii exchange rate was approximately 50 bolivars per us dollar on december 31 2014 

given accelerated deterioration in economic conditions driven by a significant drop in the price of oil and no expectation of improvement for the foreseeable future we concluded that the sicad ii exchange rate was the most appropriate rate at which to value bolivar denominated assets and liabilities as a result on december 31 2014 we moved the exchange rate applied to bolivars from the official rate to the sicad ii rate we recorded a charge of 454 million before tax and noncontrolling interest or 028 per diluted share the charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets 121 million and a noncash impairment charge to adjust venezuelan inventory balances 333 million had the sicad ii rate been applied throughout all of 2014 we estimate it would have reduced fullyear revenues and eps by approximately 95 million and 011 per share respectively after these charges we had 46 million of bolivardenominated net monetary assets and 89 million of inventory in venezuela as of december 31 2014 

on february 9 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes to its exchange rate system that included the launch of a new marketbased system called the marginal currency system or “simadi” that will replace the sicad ii rate the company is currently evaluating this announcement adoption of the simadi rate would result in additional charges to remeasure the net monetary assets and impair other assets 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2014  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risks a 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in incremental 2014 interest expense of approximately 70 million excluding the impact of our forward starting interest rate swaps in june 2014 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps for 3000 million  of our variable rate 9750 million  term loan facilities swaps with notional amounts totaling 2750 million  become effective in january 2015 and expire in september 2017 and swaps with notional amounts totaling 250 million  become effective in january 2015 and expire in december 2016 if the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense

allegion plc allegion we us or the company is a leading global provider of security products and solutions that keep people safe secure and productive we make the world safer as a company of experts securing the places where people thrive and we create peace of mind by pioneering safety and security we offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of mechanical and electronic security products across a range of marketleading brands our experts across the globe deliver highquality security products services and systems and we use our deep expertise to serve as trusted partners to endusers who seek customized solutions to their security needs 



access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building most door openings are customconfigured to maximize a room’s particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and enduser security needs most buildings have multiple door openings each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific accesscontrol solutions each door must fit exactly within its frame be prepared precisely for its hinges synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door moreover security products are increasingly linked electronically creating additional functionality and complexity 

we believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be customconfigured to meet endusers’ security needs is a key driver of our success we accomplish this with 

 

based on information derived from third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than 30 billion in revenue in 2013 comprised of 25 billion for mechanical hardware and electronic security products and more than 5 billion for time attendance and workforce productivity systems and systems integration we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends including 

 

in the more established economies of north america and europe the security products industry’s compound annual growth rate was 1 to 2 per year due to the challenging economy experienced over the past three years we believe our markets are poised for a significant cyclical recovery driven in part by accelerating growth in the underlying commercial and residential construction markets annual market revenue growth in emerging economies exceeded 5 over the past three years supported by strong demand in china the middle east and other developing economies additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities 

we operate in three geographic regions americas europe middle east india and africa emeia and asia pacific we sell our products and solutions under the following brands

we sell a wide range of security products and solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential facilities worldwide including into the education healthcare government hospitality commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our strategic brands are schlage® von duprin® lcn® cisa® and interflex® we believe schlage von duprin and lcn hold the no 1 position in their primary product categories in north america and cisa and interflex hold the no1 or no 2 position in their primary product categories in certain european markets 

for the year ended december 31 2013  we generated revenues of 20935 million  and operating income of 2358 million  



history and developments 

allegion plc was incorporated in ireland on may 9 2013 to hold ingersoll rand’s commercial and residential security businesses on december 1 2013 allegion became a standalone public company after ingersoll rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of these businesses from ingersoll rand to allegion and the issuance by allegion of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the spinoff our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago and many of our brands originally created their categories 

 

we have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of schlage von duprin and lcn in 1974 today we continue to develop and introduce innovative and marketleading products recent examples include schlage touchscreen deadbolt a residential lock cisa esigno a hotel locking platform evayo a european electronics security platform winner 2012 reddot product design award von duprin concealed vertical cable system that significantly reduces total installation time and ongoing maintenance requirements aptiq a versatile and multitechnology card reader platform and schlage’s adco an electronic locking platform that allows endusers to add additional features without lock replacement

our strengths 

our competitive strengths derive from combining application expertise and a sophisticated understanding of our markets with knowledge of our enduser’s needs and our operational excellence capabilities we define operational excellence as our lean manufacturing operations specifically our ability to handle highly complex manufacturing efficiently our agile supply chain and our ongoing programs that drive continuous improvements in our products and services our competitive strengths include 

expertise required to design customconfigured solutions for our endusers 

the functional needs regulatory requirements and aesthetics of every door opening and the related room must be considered when determining their security requirements as a result no “standard” opening exists through our long operating history we have developed the expertise required to address a wide range of entryway security needs today we believe we are a leader in our markets because 

 

diversified portfolio of marketleading brands 

many of our brands have established leadership positions in their markets and product categories and have longstanding reputations for innovation and quality several of our brands created their respective product categories including schlage cylindrical locks von duprin exit devices lcn door closures and cisa electrically controlled locks we believe that our schlage locks von duprin exit devices and lcn closures rank no 1 in their respective categories in north america and cisa security products rank no 1 in its product category in italy we also believe that many other of our brands rank no 2 or no 3 in their respective geographies including kryptonite us bricard france briton united kingdom and interflex germany the strength of these brands in their primary geographies has allowed us to extend many of them into new markets we sell products under more than 25 brand names around the world we believe that employing specific brands in targeted markets creates strong relationships with those brands ten of our brands have at least 50 million in revenue 

long history of delivering innovative and highquality products and solutions   

we have built upon our brandcreation heritage and strong reputation for innovation by continually improving our awardwinning product lines and introducing new mechanical and electronic security products we employ several hundred engineers around the world who work to support and build upon our existing product portfolio our ongoing investment in innovation has led to several recent product launches that exemplify our success for example we introduced

operational excellence capabilities that enable a highly variable product mix while meeting exacting customerdelivery timetables 

the successful design and completion of any door opening solution requires close coordination among the enduser the installer and the manufacturer larger projects which involve thousands of different parts and precise enduser specifications amplify this complexity because supply must meet demanding construction timetables 

our global manufacturing scale experience and operational capabilities enable us to deliver a highquality enduser experience we operate 19 production facilities worldwide and primarily manufacture our products and systems in regions of use to deliver them on a timely basis for several product lines including schlagevon duprin and lcn we ship our products on average in less than one week from receipt of an order regardless of configuration our operational capabilities enable us to better meet our endusers needs by allowing us to make rapid production adjustments we believe our operational excellence program is an important element of our ability to deliver strong financial performance and to continue to reinvest in our growth initiatives 

our comprehensive operational excellence program focuses on further reducing the time required from order to shipment in the six production facilities that implemented this program by the end of 2012 cycle time from receipt of a customer order to shipment has decreased by an average of more than 45 since program launch we are in the advanced stages of introducing our operational excellence program in virtually all of our production facilities we also will continue to leverage and enhance this program across our other locations and work processes while customizing those processes to best fit our business needs we expect the results to drive cost savings throughout our business and will utilize these proceeds to either improve profitability or reinvest in our growth initiatives 

robust network of valueadded channel and distribution relationships 

we sell our products through diverse distribution and retail channels ranging from specialty distribution to wholesalers we also have built a strong network of more than 7000 channel partners that help our endusers find the right solutions for their needs important to the success of these relationships we support our partners by working directly with architects contractors and security consultants to help design solutions that meet the functional regulatory and aesthetic needs of endusers we educate our channel partners and our endusers on our total cost of ownership value proposition which emphasizes the quality and durability of our products these consultative relationships result in increased knowledge and appreciation for the benefits of our products and solutions 

deep and actionoriented customer insight 

within the residential security products market understanding consumer needs and trends is key to ongoing revenue growth we have developed tools and work with thirdparty vendors such as vista information systems and retail solutions inc to better understand consumer buying patterns purchase drivers and brand performance we use our customer insights to develop targeted marketing programs and merchandising activities that maximize return on investment anticipate longterm consumer trends and drive product development decisions we also have longstanding relationships with key retailers in north america and europe such as the home depot lowes and leroy merlin due to our brand leadership positions and investments in market insight detailed account resources and ongoing collaboration with these retailers we provide category leadership in development and execution on mutually beneficial marketing programs 

strong financial performance and cash generation capabilities 

we have maintained strong operating profit margins and cash flow generation despite challenging economic conditions in some of our largest geographic markets in recent years from 2008 to 2012 for example new build square footage in the us nonresidential construction market declined 46 during that time our operating margin increased 05 to 180 excluding noncash impairment charges recorded in 2008 despite a total revenue decline of 3673 million in 2013  our operating margin was 113  180 excluding a noncash goodwill impairment charge and we generated 2239 million  million of operating cash flow from operations

our strategies 

we intend to achieve sustained profitable growth in the markets we serve today and in adjacent product categories by being the preferred trusted security partners to our endusers and by executing the following growth strategies 

expand in core markets 

with leadership positions in our markets and significant expertise we possess insight into both enduser needs and regulatory requirements in key market segments including education university and primary healthcare government general commercial and residential single and multifamily we have developed specific value propositions across these segments and will continue to leverage our knowledge and experience to identify key opportunities that better serve our endusers we expect this to include continued investment in products as well as further expansion of our specification and service capabilities 

innovation in existing and new product categories 

endusers are shifting gradually toward the electronic control of their security products and solutions we believe that electronicrelated product sales are growing at nearly twice the rate of traditional mechanical solutions according to ims research we are the no 1 global manufacturer and marketer of electromagnetic locks we intend to leverage this position and expand our global capabilities in other product categories through continued product development and investments our recent successes serve as a testament to our commitment the 2012 launch of aptiq global credential and reader platform and the corresponding aptiq alliance program a program that allows our endusers to use our aptiq products in third party nonaccess control applications such as logical access parking and payment the european launches of evayo and our cisa hospitality platforms in 2012 and 2013 respectively and the 2013 launch of the schlage touchscreen deadbolt a 2013 product of the year by electronic house magazine 

growth in emerging markets 

we believe the global security products market provides a multitude of future growth opportunities as safety demands increase and security requirements and sophistication levels evolve we also believe economically developing markets will grow faster than the global market average as countries achieve enhanced living standards and experience continued urbanization we believe our significant industry experience deep knowledge of commercial and residential building codes and history of innovation give us unique opportunities to help shape the security products industry in these markets we are committed to investing further in attractive developing markets including opening additional sales and specifications offices investing in localized product and supply chain capabilities and working with local partners and codemaking bodies to promote efficient and consistent safety and security standards we have a proven history of entering developing markets successfully as evidenced by our growing asiapacific sales since 2010 we have generated a compound annual revenue growth rate of nearly 15 in china we also founded the safety and security institute in china which helps to educate government officials architects and builders and also advocates for consistent building codes and standards that address endusers safety and security 

operational excellence 

the foundation of the process improvement at allegion is rooted in the allegion business system and our operational excellence opex initiatives we are driving opex across the enterprise and we link our opex work to specific business growth opportunities while simultaneously improving internal processes 

  

our approach to the deployment of opex begins with gaining an understanding of what customers value once there is an understanding of the customers needs and our value proposition each team responsible for a process under transformation works on activities to create value that differentiates us from our competition we are in the process of introducing our opex program in many of our processes as we execute the allegion business system and our opex activities we attempt to deliver increased value to our customers while also drive improvement to internal processes 

as part of our opex program we have reduced overall supply chain cycle time and variability across production locations that have launched the program our ability to deliver highly configured solutions to endusers within exacting timeframes is one important element of our success results in 2013 have included reductions in product lead times from customer order to shipment in our manufacturing facilities in baja mexico and indianapolis indiana our strategy involves leveraging our operational excellence capabilities as a competitive advantage to improve the overall customer experience and drive employee engagement  ultimately driving growth across all of our offerings

opportunistic acquisitions 

a disciplined approach to acquisitions is an important part of our growth strategy the security products industry is highly fragmented particularly in developing markets and emerging technology product segments that employ newer technologies this creates numerous acquisition opportunities we intend to target acquisitions that will broaden our product portfolio expand our geographic footprint and enhance our position in strategic market segments 

on january 2 2014 our whollyowned subsidiary allegion de colombia completed the acquisition of certain assets of schlage lock de colombia sa the second largest mechanical lock manufacturer in that country the acquisition of certain assets of the privatelyowned company which has distribution in other south and central american countries will enable us to leverage our branded residential and commercial product lines to grow our presence in the spanishspeaking south american security market 

we now operate a 45000squarefoot integrated plant in bogota colombia and will continue to sell product under the schlage brand as well as the inafer and segurex brands allegion de colombia has approximately 350 employees 

industry and competition 

based on information derived from third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than 30 billion in revenue in 2013 comprised of 25 billion for mechanical hardware and electronic security products and more than 5 billion for time attendance and workforce productivity systems and systems integration with compound annual growth of about 1 to 2 per year over the past three years this growth rate primarily reflects cyclical challenges in the commercial and residential construction markets throughout north america and europe as certain developing economies experienced higher growth rates during this period additionally growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities we expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation 

the security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies this high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs we believe our principal global competitors are assa abloy ab dorma holding gmbh kaba holding ag and stanley black  decker inc we also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from spectrum brands holdings inc in the north american residential market as we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against smaller more specialized competitors 

our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities as many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain

intellectual property inclusive of certain patents trademarks copyrights knowhow trade secrets and other proprietary rights is important to our business we create protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights we use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others we consider our schlage von duprin cisa and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license or any particular group of patents or licenses 

facilities 

we operate through a broad network of sales offices 19 production facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world our active properties represent about 51 million square feet of which approximately 49 is leased 

 11 

the following table shows the location of our worldwide production facilities 



research and development 

we are committed to investing in highly productive research and development capabilities particularly in electromechanical systems our research and development rd expenditures were approximately  396 million   382 million  and  389 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

we concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions and also on driving continuous improvements in product cost quality safety and sustainability 

we manage our rd team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms we are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations in addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region we also operate a global engineering center of excellence in bangalore india 

seasonality 

our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the northern hemisphere our security product sales typically are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters however our interflex and asia pacific systems integration businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing revenue by quarter for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 are as follows 



employees 

as of december 31 2013 we had more than 8000 employees approximately 20 of whom have the terms of their employment covered under collective bargaining agreements our nonmanagement european employees are represented by national and local works councils 

environmental regulation 

we are dedicated to an environmental program intended to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns as to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities 

 12 

we are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the us environmental protection agency and similar state authorities we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party prp for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal superfund and state remediation sites for all such sites there are other prps and in most instances our involvement is minimal 

in estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other prps who may be jointly and severally liable the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future 

we incurred  21 million   29 million  and 19 million  of expenses during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  108 million  and  118 million  respectively of these amounts  29 million  and  25 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us our total current environmental reserve at december 31 2013  and 2012  was  42 million  and  23 million  respectively given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain

 item 1a     risk factors   

you should carefully consider the risks below together with all the other information included in this form 10k in evaluating us and our ordinary shares if any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial 

risks related to our business 

our global operations subject us to economic risks 

we are incorporated in ireland and operate in countries worldwide our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the us and internationally including in europe china australia mexico venezuela and turkey accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including 

  13 

these risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations and limit our ability to sell products in certain markets 

our business relies on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets 

we primarily rely on the commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services 

our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services 

we must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business we cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market we also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market 

changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business 

we have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented more than 10 of combined net sales in 2013 2012 or 2011 the loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers this limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales 

our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation 

our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs there can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 

currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results 

we are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk” 

approximately 36 of our 2013 net revenues were derived outside the us and we expect sales to nonus customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations because we do not hedge against all of our currency exposure our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations 

we also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonus dollar currencies into us dollars for our combined and consolidated financial statements based on applicable exchange rates consequently fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies will have a material impact on the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency 

our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings we cannot assure you that we will identify or 

 14 

successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we assure you that completed acquisitions will be successful 

acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expensess acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

we may also expand through acquisitions or investments into international markets in which we may have limited experience or are required to rely on business partners in addition to the risks outlined above expansion into international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly integrate acquired operations efficiently into our current business operations or effectively compete in new markets we enter any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

our operational excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect 

we utilize a number of tools to improve operational efficiency and productivity implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and there is no assurance that all of our planned operational excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements 

material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business 

we are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental matters that cannot be predicted with certainty as required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments 

allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties in particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others in general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights the litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we are subject to regulation under a variety of us federal and state and nonus laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations we cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties 

 15 

material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence 

we may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business if these systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 

we currently rely on a single vendor for many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure and its failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

we have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information technology infrastructure to a thirdparty service provider in order to achieve efficiencies if the service provider does not perform or does not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service provider depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches 

our information technology infrastructure is important to our business and data security breaches or disruptions of such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results 

our information technology infrastructure is subject to cyberattacks and unauthorized security intrusions despite instituting security policies and business continuity plans our systems and networks may be vulnerable to system damage malicious attacks from hackers employee errors or misconduct viruses power and utility outages and other catastrophic events that could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations compromising the security of our proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation 

commodity shortages and price increases could negatively affect our financial results 

we rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products a disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs we believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business 

volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers we do not currently hedge against this volatility the pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices to mitigate this exposure we may use annual and multiyear fixed price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

at december 31 2013 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately  505 million  and  9 million  respectively in accordance with us gaap we periodically assess these assets to determine whether they are impaired negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business unexpected changes or planned changes in use of assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges in particular our asia pacific  other reporting unit had 57 million of goodwill and an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 at december 31 2013 

successful sales and marketing efforts depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to successfully grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives our sales force and other personnel including the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage we must therefore continue to recruit retain and motivate management sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business 

 16 

our operations are subject to regulatory risks 

our us and nonus operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and standards environmental and health and safety we have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 

we may not have been or we may not at all times be in full compliance with these laws and regulations in the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned 

certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain us federal and state laws and certain nonus laws are retroactive strict and joint and several in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances we have received notification from us and nonus governmental agencies including the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action these agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites for more information see “business  environmental regulation” 

while we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates we may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities 

the capital and credit markets are important to our business 

instability in us and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements in particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy 

our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers 

our operations in venezuela expose us to several risks 

venezuela is currently experiencing significant political and civil unrest and economic instability and in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivares fuertes vef to 1 us dollar we recognized a 62 million realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation in the first quarter of 2013 when the government devalued the vef in february 2013 it established a new auctionbased exchange rate market program referred to as sicad the amount of transactions that have run through the sicad and restrictions around participation have limited our access to any foreign exchange rate other than the official rate to pay for imported goods and manage our local monetary asset balances accordingly all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official 63 exchange rate at december 31 2013 

in late january 2014 the venezuelan government made several announcements affecting currency exchange and other controls although the official exchange rate remains at 63 the government announced that the exchange rate for certain foreign investments will move to the rate available on the sicad currency market which in the last auction was 117 vef to 1 us dollar the impact 

 17 

to us of a devaluation from the official exchange rate to the sicad market exchange rate would be a charge of approximately 10 million based on net financial asset balances as of december 31 2013 however the charge could be higher if the sicad market exchange rate moves higher there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through sicad and how sicad will operate in the future however we believe there is considerable risk that the official rate will be devalued further further devaluation could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

this current state of affairs could lead to further devaluation of its currency volatility of exchange rates and disruption of the economy if the current unrest and instability continues our ability to acquire necessary goods from suppliers could be limited our customers may not be able to fulfill their obligations our ability to manufacture and sell products could be disrupted and our venezuelan operations could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our substantial leverage could harm our business by limiting our available cash and our access to additional capital and to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness exposing us to interest rate risk 

we have approximately 13 billion of outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2013 in addition we have a senior secured revolving credit facility permitting borrowings of up to 500 million this amount of indebtedness substantially increases our cash interest expense in future years compared to prior years and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions restructuring and general corporate or other purposes limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors further volatility in the credit markets would adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable terms on financing in the future in addition a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs and future business opportunities we may be more vulnerable than a less leveraged company to a downturn in the general economic conditions or in our business or we may be unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases as certain of our borrowings including those under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which actions may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness for more information see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations in the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain customary financial covenants that may restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices we believe are fair and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 

despite our levels of indebtedness we may still be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 

we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future although the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain customary restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial in addition our senior secured revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to 500 million if we incur additional debt above the levels we currently have the risks associated with our leverage including those described above would increase 

 18 

the terms of our debt covenants could limit how we conduct our business and our ability to raise additional funds 

the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes restrict us from taking certain actions that we may think are in the best interests of our shareholders a breach of the covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our plans 

these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise additionally our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including general economic and credit conditions and industry downturns and the other factors described in these “risk factors” 

our variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly 

a portion of our borrowings at december 31 2013 are term loans with variable rates of interest which expose us to interest rate risks we are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings at december 31 2013 we have approximately 13 billion of aggregate debt outstanding and this amount includes 10 billion of floatingrate term loans and 300 million of our fixedrate senior notes we have the ability to incur up to 500 million of additional floatingrate debt under our senior secured revolving credit facility based on the amount of floatingrate debt outstanding at december 31 2013 a 100 basis point increase in libor would result in an incremental annual interest expense of approximately 71 million if the libor or other applicable base rates under our senior secured credit facilities increase in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense 

risks relating to the spinoff 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from our spinoff from ingersoll rand 

as an independent publiclytraded company we believe that our business will benefit from among other things allowing us to better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business allowing our board of directors and management to design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the characteristics of our business allowing us to more effectively respond to industry dynamics and allowing the creation of effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance however we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect if at all 

our accounting and other management systems may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we will be subject following the spinoff 

our financial results were previously included within the consolidated results of ingersoll rand and we believe that our financial reporting and internal controls were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company however we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the securities exchange act as amended the “exchange act” in connection with the spinoff we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act beginning with our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2014 we will be required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments these reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management administrative and operational resources including accounting systems and resources 

the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition under the sarbanesoxley act we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 19 

we may be unable to make on a timely or costeffective basis the changes necessary to operate as an independent company and we may experience increased costs 

we have historically operated as part of ingersoll rand’s corporate organization and ingersoll rand has assisted us by providing certain corporate functions ingersoll rand is obligated contractually to provide to us only those transition services specified in agreements we entered into with ingersoll rand we may be unable to replace in a timely manner or on comparable terms the services or other benefits that ingersoll rand previously provided to us that are not specified in any transition services agreement upon expiration of any transition services agreement each of the services that are covered in the agreement will have to be provided internally or by third parties and we may be unable to replace those services in a timely manner or on comparable terms in addition if ingersoll rand does not continue to perform transition services and the other services that are called for under any transition services agreement we may not be able to operate our business as effectively 

our historical combined financial data are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the historical data we presented herein may not reflect what our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been an independent publiclytraded company during the periods presented or what our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be in the future when we are an independent company this is primarily because 

 

our historical financial data does not include an allocation of interest expense comparable to the ongoing interest expense we will incur as part of the financing of the spinoff after giving proforma effect to the spinoff our interest expense would have been approximately 53 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 102 million reflected in our historical financial statements 

as an independent publiclytraded company we may not enjoy the same benefits that we did as a part of ingersoll rand 

there is a risk that by separating from ingersoll rand we may become more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been if we were still part of ingersoll rand as part of ingersoll rand we were able to enjoy certain benefits from ingersoll rand’s operating diversity purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with ingersoll rand’s other businesses as an independent publiclytraded company we do not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and may not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets 

as an independent publiclytraded company our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed significantly from our historical capital structure 

we have 10 billion outstanding under our senior secured term loan facilities and 300 million of fixed rate senior notes among other borrowings the net proceeds of the senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities were distributed to ingersoll rand as an independent publiclytraded company we will no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with ingersoll rand instead our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and to access our borrowing facilities and capital markets which is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

 20 

the ownership by our executive officers of ordinary shares stock options or other stockbased awards of ingersoll rand may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest  

substantially all of our executive officers own ordinary shares of ingersoll rand stock options to purchase ordinary shares of ingersoll rand or other ingersoll rand stockbased awards because of their former positions with ingersoll rand the individual holdings of ordinary shares stock options to purchase ordinary shares or other stockbased awards of ingersoll rand may be significant for some of these persons compared to their total assets these equity interests may create or appear to create conflicts of interest when these officers are faced with decisions that could benefit or affect the officers as equity holders of ingersoll rand in ways that do not benefit or affect us or our shareholders in the same manner 

the onetime and ongoing costs of the spinoff may be greater than we expected 

we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in connection with being a standalone public company that relate primarily to accounting tax legal and other professional costs financing costs in connection with obtaining our financing as a standalone company compensation such as modifications to certain incentive awards upon completion of the spinoff recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring our senior management personnel and costs to separate assets and information systems these costs may be greater than anticipated 

we may not be able to achieve a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate 

we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in future years because of among other things uncertainty regarding the geographic mix of income and the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material additionally the tax laws of ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate 

we may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements related to the spinoff 

the agreements related to the spinoff including the separation and distribution agreement employee matters agreement tax matters agreement transition services agreement agreements with respect to real estate and intellectual property matters and any other agreements were negotiated in the context of the spinoff from ingersoll rand while we were still part of ingersoll rand accordingly these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’slength negotiations among unaffiliated third parties the terms of the agreements in the context of the spinoff are related to among other things allocations of assets liabilities rights indemnifications and other obligations among ingersoll rand and us we might have received better terms under the agreements relating to the spinoff had they been negotiated with disinterested third parties who competed with each other to win our business than we received from ingersoll rand 

in connection with the spinoff ingersoll rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified ingersoll rand for certain liabilities if we are required to act on these indemnities to ingersoll rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted the ingersoll rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and ingersoll rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement the employee matters agreement and the tax matters agreement with ingersoll rand ingersoll rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify ingersoll rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the spinoff third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that ingersoll rand retained further the indemnity from ingersoll rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and ingersoll rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from ingersoll rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 

if the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spinoff are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax andor ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ingersoll rand has received an irs ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under sections 355 and 368a of the internal revenue code the code

with the result that ingersoll rand and ingersoll rand’s shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the irs ruling the irs ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the irs ruling ingersoll rand received opinions from the law firm of simpson thacher  bartlett llp substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the irs did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution received taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code the receipt and effectiveness of the irs ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by ingersoll rand the irs ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the irs ruling and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion in addition the opinion will be based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition we or ingersoll rand could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or ingersoll rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

in addition the amount of our shares that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our shares may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for ingersoll rand under section 355e of the code and under the tax matters agreement we could be required to indemnify ingersoll rand for that tax 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the distribution because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted after the distribution in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution by ingersoll rand even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in a corporatelevel taxable gain to ingersoll rand and certain of its affiliates under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or ingersoll rand’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or ingersoll rand’s shares within two years after the distribution will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan although we or ingersoll rand may be able to rebut that presumption 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to ingersoll rand of the distribution under the tax matters agreement we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree further for the twoyear period following the distribution without obtaining the consent of ingersoll rand a private letter ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion from a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm we are prohibited from among other things 

 

these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the tax matters agreement provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on ingersoll rand or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code unless such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distribution by ingersoll rand 

 22 

in february 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of our ordinary shares due to these restrictions we may not engage in privately negotiated transactions or acquire more than 20 of our outstanding shares within two years after the distribution we believe that we will be able to execute the authorized share repurchases and preserve the taxfree treatment of the distribution however if we are unable to preserve the taxfree treatment any taxes imposed on us could be significant 

if the distribution is determined to be taxable for irish tax purposes significant irish tax liabilities may arise 

ingersoll rand has received an opinion of the irish revenue regarding the irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply in addition to obtaining the opinion from irish revenue ingersoll rand received an opinion from the law firm of arthur cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs these opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and ingersoll rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the opinions irish revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated a legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment is not binding on irish revenue or the courts and irish revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion in addition the legal opinion was based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect if the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an irish resident or holds shares in ingersoll rand in an irish branch or agency or we or ingersoll rand could incur irish tax liabilities 

in addition under the terms of the tax matters agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or ingersoll rand as a result of such determination such tax amounts could be significant 

risks relating to our ordinary shares 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

our ordinary shares are listed on nyse under the ticker symbol “alle” the market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares 

in addition when the market price of a company’s shares drops significantly shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and our indebtedness could   limit our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 

 23 

on february 11 2014 our board of directors declared a 008 per ordinary share dividend payable on march 31 2014 to shareholders of record at march 17 2014 whether our board of directors continues to exercise its discretion to propose any dividends to holders of our ordinary shares will depend on many factors including our financial condition earnings future prospects and capital requirements of our business covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints income tax consequences industry practice and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debtpayment obligations then our ability to pay dividends if so determined by the board of directors may be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing our dividend there can be no assurance however that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms if at all 

your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future 

your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of additional equity issuances for acquisitions strategic investments capital markets transactions or otherwise including equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors officers and employees in the future such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share which could materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares in addition some ingersoll rand equity awards held by our employees were converted into allegion equity awards in connection with the spinoff we established equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of ordinary sharebased equity awards to our directors officers and other employees under our incentive stock plan the total number of ordinary shares authorized is 80 million  of which 50 million  remains available as of december 31 2013  for future incentive awards 

if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business our share price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our ordinary shares depends to some extent on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business we do not have any control over these analysts and the reports they issue if our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or negatively change their opinion of our shares our share price would likely decline if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline 

risks related to our incorporation in ireland 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters as such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on us federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states 

in addition irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval also subject to specified exceptions irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash however we have opted out of these preemption rights in our articles of association as permitted under irish company law irish law provides that this optout expires after five years unless renewed by a special resolution of the shareholders these authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved 

 24 

changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes 

the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions from time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor effective tax rate for instance recent us legislative proposals would broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a us resident for us tax purposes which would significantly diminish the realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation in ireland there are other recent us legislative proposals that could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position moreover other us legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments by our us subsidiaries to our nonus affiliates which could increase our tax liability we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction 

while we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect in particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation 

dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

in certain circumstances we are required to deduct irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders in the majority of cases shareholders resident in the united states will not be subject to irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain irish dividend withholding tax forms however some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact on the price of our shares 

dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to irish income tax 

dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with ireland other than his or her shareholding in allegion 

certain provisions in our articles of association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares 

our memorandum and articles of association contain provisions deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers these provisions include amongst others 

 

we believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may 

 25 

be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition several mandatory provisions of irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us for example irish law does not permit shareholders of an irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent we also will be subject to various provisions of irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances also irish companies including us may alter their memorandum of association and articles of association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the company’s shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company 

the agreements that we entered into with ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff generally require ingersoll rand’s consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements the consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 

moreover an acquisition or further issuance of our ordinary shares after the spinoff could trigger the application of section 355e of the code even if the distribution and certain related transactions undertaken in connection therewith otherwise qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355e of the code we andor ingersoll rand could incur tax upon certain transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution if 50 or more by vote or value of our ordinary shares or ingersoll rand ordinary shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spinoff the process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex inherently factual and subject to interpretation any acquisitions or issuances of our ordinary shares or ingersoll rand ordinary shares within two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or ingersoll rand as applicable may be able to rebut that presumption moreover under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with ingersoll rand we are restricted from engaging in certain transactions within two years of the distribution which potentially could trigger application of section 355e of the code during such period these restrictions may limit the ability that we or a potential acquirer of allegion have to pursue certain strategic transactions that might increase the value of our ordinary shares

 item 7    management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information including our combined and consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which appears elsewhere in this annual report 

overview 

organization 

we are a leading global provider of security products and solutions operating in three geographic regions americas emeia and asia pacific we sell a wide range of security products and solutions for endusers in commercial institutional and residential markets worldwide including into the education healthcare government commercial office and single and multifamily residential markets our strategic brands include schlage von duprin lcn cisa and interflex 

trends and economic events 

current market conditions including challenges in international markets continue to impact our financial results uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting our results however us residential and consumer markets have begun to improve and we are seeing improvements in the us new builder and replacement markets 

based on information derived from third party sources we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was more than 30 billion in revenue in 2013 comprised of 25 billion for mechanical hardware products and more than 5 billion for time attendance and workforce productivity systems and systems integration we believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and longterm demographic trends which include heightened awareness of security requirements increased global urbanization and the shift to a digital interconnected environment in the more established economies of north america and europe where the security product industry’s compound annual growth rate was 1 to 2 per year during the challenging economy experienced over the past three years we believe our markets are poised for a cyclical recovery driven in part by accelerating growth in the underlying commercial and residential construction markets annual revenue growth for the security products market in emerging economies which represented approximately 146 of our net revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 exceeded 5 over the past 3 years additionally we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to continue to outperform the industry as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities 

our business may be negatively impacted if among other things market conditions in north america and europe worsen or do not improve as we expect them to developing economies in which we do business decline or do not continue to grow at recent rates or we are unable to capitalize on the growth in electronic product categories a number of other challenges and uncertainties that could affect our business are described under “risk factors” 

2013 significant events 

spinoff transaction 

on december 1 2013 allegion became a standalone public company after ingersollrand plc ingersoll rand completed the separation of its commercial and residential security businesses the “business” from the rest of ingersoll rand via the transfer of the business from ingersoll rand to allegion and the issuance by allegion of ordinary shares directly to ingersoll rand’s shareholders the “spinoff” as part of the spinoff allegion issued one ordinary share for every three ordinary shares of ingersoll rand held of record as of 500 pm new york city time on november 22 2013 allegion ordinary shares trade under the symbol “alle” on the new york stock exchange allegion issued a total of approximately 960 million ordinary shares in the spinoff we incurred approximately 59 million of nonrecurring separation costs in 2013 related to the spinoff 

indebtedness 

in conjunction with the spinoff we issued 1300 million of indebtedness comprised of i 300 million of 575 senior secured notes due in 2021 and ii a credit agreement providing for a 10 billion of senior secured term loan facilities consisting of 

 30 

a 500 million “tranche a” term loan facility due in 2018 the “term loan a facility” and a 500 million “tranche b” term loan facility due in 2020 the “term loan b facility” and together with the term loan a facility the “term facilities” and b a 500 million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolver maturing in 2018 these credit facilities are referred to as the “senior secured credit facilities” the net proceeds of this indebtedness approximately 12744 million were distributed to ingersoll rand in connection with the spinoff 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

see “critical accounting policies  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  2013 impairment test” for further discussion 

joint venture order flow change 

in late 2013 we signed a revised joint venture operating agreement for our consolidated joint venture in asia previously the joint venture acted as a passthrough to the end customer the consolidated joint venture will no longer recognize the revenue and cost of goods sold on these products going forward products are shipped direct to the end customer with the joint venture receiving a royalty in an amount that approximates the lost margin we recognized revenue of approximately 52 million and 78 million related to this business in our americas segment for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 the change is not expected to have a material impact on operating income or on cash flows in future periods 

venezuela devaluation 

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under us gaap as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated joint venture in venezuela any currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings 

in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivares fuertes vef to 1 us dollar we recognized a 62 million realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation in the first quarter of 2013 when the government devalued the vef in february 2013 it established a new auctionbased exchange rate market program referred to as sicad the amount of transactions that have run through the sicad and restrictions around participation have limited our access to any foreign exchange rate other than the official rate to pay for imported goods and manage our local monetary asset balances accordingly all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official 63 exchange rate at december 31 2013 

in late january 2014 the venezuelan government made several announcements affecting currency exchange and other controls although the official exchange rate remains at 63 the government announced that the exchange rate for certain foreign investments will move to the rate available on the sicad currency market which in the last auction was 117 vef to 1 us dollar the impact to us of a devaluation from the official exchange rate to the sicad market exchange rate would approximate 10 million based on net financial asset balances as of december 31 2013there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through sicad and how sicad will operate in the future however we believe there is considerable risk that the official rate will be devalued further further devaluation could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

 31 

results of operations  for the years ended december 31 

  



net revenues 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2013  increased by 23  or  469 million  compared to the same period in 2012  due to the following 

  



the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by improved pricing across all segments as well as increased volumes in the americas segment due to stronger demand in both the commercial and residential markets as well as new products particularly from our electronics portfolio these increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts lower volume in emeia due to weak markets and the impact of the change in order flow through our consolidated joint venture in asia discussed above 

 32 

net revenues for the year ended december 31 2012  increased by 13  or  254 million  compared to the same period in 2011  due to the following 



the increase in revenues was primarily driven by improved pricing across all segments and increased volumes in the americas segment due to stronger demand in residential markets these increases were partially offset by decreased volumeproduct mix in emeia due to weak markets and unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

cost of goods sold 

for the year ended december 31 2013  cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to 589  from 597  costs of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was favorably impacted by a 215 million gain on a property sale in china 10 and negatively impacted by 38 million of restructuring charges and nonrecurring separation costs incurred in connection with the spinoff 02 cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was negatively impacted by 37 million of restructuring charges and other costs 02 excluding the impact of these items cost of goods sold as a percentage for the year ended december 31 2013 increased to 598 from 595 primarily due to inflation 19 and unfavorable channelregion mix 05 partially offset by productivity benefits and other items 21 

for the year ended december 31 2012  cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased to 597  594 excluding restructuring charges from 599  the improvement is the result of productivity actions and favorable currency impacts partially offset by material inflation

for the year ended december 31 2013  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 232  from 223  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 was negatively impacted by 27 million of restructuring charges 01 and 50 of nonrecurring separation costs incurred in connection with the spinoff 02 selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was negatively impacted by 45 million of restructuring charges and other costs 02 excluding the impact of these items selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 229 from 221 primarily due to nonmaterial inflation 12 and increased investment spending 05 partially offset by productivity benefits 05 and other items 04 

for the year ended december 31 2012  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue remained at 223  compared to the prior year restructuring charges and nonmaterial inflation were partially offset by productivity benefits and favorable currency impacts 

operating incomemargin 

operating margin for the year ended december 31 2013  decreased to 113  from 180  for the same period in 2012  operating margin for the year ended december 31 2103 was negatively impacted by the noncash goodwill impairment charge 66 and favorably impacted by the gain on a property sale in china 11 excluding the impact of these items operating margin for the year ended december 31 2013 was 169 the decrease was primarily due incremental investment spending associated with new product development 06 unfavorable product mix 05 and restructuring charges and nonrecurring separation costs 02 partially offset by favorable volume leverage 02 price increases 14 and productivity benefits 24 offset inflation higher corporate expense allocations and other items 38 collectively for the year ended december 31 2013 

operating margin for the year ended december 31 2012  increased to 180  from 178  for the same period in 2011  the increase was primarily due to improved pricing in excess of material inflation 17 and the realization of productivity benefits in excess of other inflation 06 these increases were partially offset by unfavorable volumeproduct mix 13 and increased investment spending 08 

interest expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013  increased  87 million  compared to the same period in 2012  as a result of entering into the 1000 million total senior secured credit facilities and issuing 300 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013 in conjunction with the spinoff from ingersoll rand had this debt been outstanding as of the beginning of 2013 our interest expense would have been approximately 53 million for the year ended december 31 2013

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012  increased  01 million  compared with the same period of 2011  our interestbearing debt balances were 50 million and 49 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the amount of interest expense incurred is consistent with the fluctuation in the balance of interestbearing debt for all periods 

other net 

the components of other net for the year ended december 31  are as follows 

  



for the year ended december 31 2013  other net decreased by  39 million  compared to the same period in 2012  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts included within exchange gain loss for the year ended december 31 2013 is a 62 million realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar vef from the preexisting exchange rate of 43 vef to 1 us dollar to 63 vef to 1 us dollar 

for the year ended december 31 2012  other net decreased by  78 million  compared with the same period in 2011  primarily from unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

provision for income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2013  our effective tax rate of 797  compared to 373  for the year ended december 31 2012  the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 included the impact of a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of 1376 million 1312 million aftertax additionally the effective tax rate included 448 million of discrete tax adjustments consisting of 315 million of expense related to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized and 133 million of net tax expense resulting primarily from transactions occurring to effect the spinoff excluding these items the effective tax rate was 364 our tax rate was above the us statutory rate of 350  primarily due to us state and local taxes and net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate had a lower effective rate 

for periods prior to the spinoff income tax expense has been recorded as if we filed tax returns on a standalone basis this separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we were a standalone enterprise for the periods prior to the spinoff using statutory rates these rates did not contemplate certain tax strategies that could lower the effective tax rate in future periods if executed 

for the year ended december 31 2012  our effective tax rate of 373  compared to 360  for the year ended december 31 2011  our tax rate was above the us statutory rate of 350  primarily due to us state and local taxes and net increases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by earnings in nonus jurisdictions which in aggregate had a lower effective rate 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations recognized a loss for the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to lease expense and other miscellaneous expenses from previously sold businesses 

review of business segments 

we operate in and report financial results for three segments americas emeia and asia pacific these segments represent the level at which our chief operating decision maker reviews company financial performance and makes operating decisions 

segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for resource allocation performance reviews and compensation for these reasons we believe that segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss our chief operating decision maker may exclude certain charges or gains such as corporate charges and other special charges from operating income to arrive at a segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions we define segment operating margin as segment operating income as a percentage of net revenues 

 34 

the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations effective january 1 2013 we transferred a product line from our asia pacific segment to our americas segment this transfer is reflected in the historical segment results for each of the fiscal years in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

sources and uses of liquidity 

our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is used to invest in new product development fund capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements and is expected to be adequate to 

 37 

service any future debt pay any declared dividends and potentially fund acquisitions and share repurchases our ability to fund these capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash provided by operating activities and to access our borrowing facilities including unused availability under our revolver and capital markets we believe that our future cash provided by operating activities together with our access to funds on hand and capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs 

the following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended december 31 respectively for additional details please see the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows in the combined and consolidated financial statements 



operating activities 

cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased 453 million compared to the same period in the prior year operating cash flows for 2013 reflect lower earnings from continuing operations and an increase in working capital compared to the same period in the prior year 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2692 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2655 million for 2011 operating cash flows for 2012 and 2011 reflect consistent earnings from continuing operations and working capital levels 

investing activities 

cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 12 million compared to the same period in the prior year cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 included 202 million of capital expenditures 402 million of cash classified as restricted as it is pledged as collateral against a shortterm note payable and 417 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment primarily related to proceeds from the sale of property in china 

net cash used in continuing investing activities was 175 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 35 million for 2011 the decline in investing activities for 2011 is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the integrated systems and services divestiture 

capital expenditures were  202 million   196 million  and  255 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in 2014 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 400 million as we invest in information technology systems new product development and manufacturing plant related capital to support our growth initiatives 

financing activities 

cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased 255 million compared to the same period in the prior year net transfers to ingersoll rand increased 12867 million as the 13000 million proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities were distributed to ingersoll rand net of debt issuance costs 

net cash used in continuing financing activities was 3179 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2536 million for 2011 the change in financing activities is primarily attributable to net transfers to ingersoll rand of 3116 million and 2406 million for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

 38 

capitalization 

borrowings at december 31 consisted of the following 



the term loan a facility amortizes in quarterly installments with the first such installment due at the end of the first quarter of 2014 at the following rates per year 5 in year one 5 in year two and 10 in each year thereafter with the final installment due on september 27 2018 the term loan b facility amortizes in quarterly installments with the first such installment due at the end of the first quarter of 2014 in an amount equal to 100 per annum with the balance due on september 27 2020 the senior notes are due in full on october 1 2021 

at december 31 2013 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the revolver and had 246 million of letters of credit outstanding which reduce availability under the revolver 

included in the other shortterm borrowings is a 402 shortterm note payable due in march 2014 the 402 million of restricted cash presented on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 was pledged as collateral for the shortterm note payable 

we are required to comply with certain covenants under our senior secured credit facilities we are required to comply with a maximum leverage ratio of 400 based on a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness net of unrestricted cash up to 100 million to consolidated ebitda and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 350 based on a ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense net of interest income as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with these covenants additionally the indenture to our senior notes and the senior secured credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that among other things limit or restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions for further details on these covenants see note 8 to the combined and consolidated financial statements 

the majority of nonus earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in nonus jurisdictions where the company has made and intends to continue to make substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our global operations accordingly applicable income taxes have not been accrued on the portion of our earnings that is considered to be permanently reinvested however in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded 75 million of tax expense related certain undistributed earnings of a nonus subsidiary no longer deemed to be permanently reinvested at december 31 2013 we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 2274 million approximately 653 of our cash and cash equivalents was located outside the us including approximately 69 million in venezuela we do not intend nor do we foresee a need to repatriate these funds however repatriation of these funds would expose us to additional taxes 

pension plans 

our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due we seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities global asset allocation decisions are based on a dynamic approach whereby a plans allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time we monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance 

we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis during 2013 none of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets for further details on pension plan activity see note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial statements 

 39 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods in millions 

  



future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans income taxes environmental and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above 

pensions 

at december 31 2013  we had net obligations of 831 million  which consist of noncurrent pension assets of 5461 million  and current and noncurrent pension benefit liabilities of 6292 million  it is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required we currently project that we will contribute approximately 170 million  to our plans worldwide in 2014  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 

postretirement benefits other than pensions 

at december 31 2013  we had postretirement benefit obligations of  142 million  we fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a payasyougo basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations benefit payments which are net of expected plan participant contributions and medicare part d subsidy are expected to be approximately 11 million  in 2014  because the timing and amounts of longterm funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 10 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

at december 31 2013  we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of  406 million  and  115 million  of related accrued interest and penalties net of tax the liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid see note 16 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes including unrecognized tax benefits and internal revenue service irs tax disputes 

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigations claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental asbestosrelated and product liability matters we believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain they have been excluded from the preceding table see note 20 to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined and consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from estimates if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known 

 40 

the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical 

 recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test included in gaap for those reporting units where it is required the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value a second step is performed wherein the reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value impairment exists and must be recognized 

as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques a discounted cash flow model income approach and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach with each method being equally weighted in the calculation we believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate the income approach relies on the company’s estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk the market approach reflects the market’s expectations for future growth and risk with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publiclytraded companies and the subject reporting units 

in step 2 the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit 

recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired this assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset for those indefinitelived assets where it is required a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology income approach which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess 

the determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows including profit margins longterm forecasts discount rates and terminal growth rates we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit 

2013 impairment test 

as discussed under 2012 impairment test the estimated fair value of our emeia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 25 as of october 1 2012 we continued to monitor the close proximity of the reporting units carrying value compared to its fair value and determined that we were required to complete the first step of the twostep impairment test in the third quarter of 2013 under the income approach we assumed a discount rate of 110 near term growth rates ranging from 25 to 46 and a terminal growth rate of 25 under the market approach we assumed a weighted average multiple of 89 and 80 times projected 2013 and 2014 ebitda respectively and a multiple of 07 and 06 times projected 2013 and 2014 revenue respectively based on industry market data the results of our impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our emeia reporting unit was less than its carrying value consequently we performed the second step of the impairment test to quantify the amount of the noncash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of 1376 million 1312 million aftertax this charge had no impact on our cash flows or our compliance with debt covenants immediately after the impairment charge our emeia 

 41 

reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by 214 on a step one basis as of july 1 2013 for our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2013 the fair value of our emeia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 24 

during 2013 we renegotiated a significant joint venture contract within our asia pacific  other reporting unit and moved the related product line to our americas segment as a result of these business changes we completed the first step of the twostep impairment test this reporting unit has goodwill of approximately 57 million 

our asia pacific  other reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7 as of october 1 2013 we have provided below key assumptions and a sensitivity analysis under the income approach we assumed a weighted average discount rate of 130 near term growth rates ranging from 13 to 159 and a terminal growth rate of 40 under the market approach we assumed a weighted average implied multiple of 09 and 105 times projected 2012 revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda respectively based on industry market data holding other assumptions constant a 10 increase in the discount rate would result in a 78 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit a 10 decrease in the longterm growth rate would result in a 55 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit either of these scenarios individually would result in the reporting unit failing step 1 which would lead to any or all of the reporting units 57 million of goodwill to be impaired 

2012 impairment test 

for our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangibles based on the results of these calculations we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

goodwill   under the income approach we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 100  to 120  near term growth rates ranging from 11  to 148  and terminal growth rates ranging from 25  to 40  under the market approach we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 67  to 79  of projected ebitda and 08  to 12  of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies 

for all reporting units except the emeia reporting unit the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value was a minimum of 15  the emeia reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by 25  this reporting unit had goodwill of approximately  190 million  

for the emeia reporting unit we have provided below additional assumptions and a sensitivity analysis under the income approach we assumed a discount rate of 10 near term growth rates ranging from 11 to 5 and a terminal growth rate of 25 under the market approach we assumed a weighted average multiple of 78 and 71 times projected 2012 and 2013 ebitda respectively and a multiple of 08 times projected 2012 and 2013 revenue based on industry market data holding other assumptions constant a 10 increase in the discount rate would result in a 20 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit a 10 decrease in the longterm growth rate would result in a 15 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and a 50 decrease in the selected market multiples would result in a 15 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit each of these scenarios individually would result in the reporting unit failing step 1 

assessing the fair value of goodwill includes among other things making key assumptions for estimating future cash flows and appropriate market multiples these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity we make every effort to estimate future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed however changes in assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and could result in impairment charges in future periods factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to the following 

  42 

 other indefinitelived intangible assets   in testing our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with a discount rate of 110 a terminal growth rate of 25 and a royalty rate of 50 all indefinitelived intangible assets had a fair value that exceeded their carrying value by more than 15 

a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows 

 we offer various sales incentive programs to our customers dealers and distributors sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition but do require an accrual for our best estimate of expected activity examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include but are not limited to discounts ie net 30 type coupons and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable at december 31 2013  and 2012  we had a customer claim accrual contra receivable of 219 million  and 208 million  respectively all other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level remain a customer for a certain period provide a rebate form or is subject to 

 43 

additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability at december 31 2013  and 2012  we had a sales incentive accrual of 210 million  and 202 million  respectively each of these accruals represents our best estimate we expect to pay related to previously sold units based on historical claim experience these estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy if updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on our combined financial statements 

we provide equipment integrated solutions and installation designed to customer specifications through constructiontype contracts the term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year but can be as long as three years revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method in accordance with gaap this measure of progress toward completion utilized to recognize sales and profits is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion the timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue at december 31 2013 all recorded receivables billed and unbilled are due within one year we reevaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catchup method these periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments if estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues then the excess costs are accrued 

we enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements such as equipment installation and service revenue for multiple element arrangements each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting the total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists otherwise thirdparty evidence tpe of selling price is used if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable we primarily utilize vsoe to determine its relative selling price we recognize revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has standalone value to the customer the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist 

 the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate future changes in applicable laws projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us in addition tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions timing and amount of income or deductions and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate a significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters we will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 

foreign currency exposures 

we have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets as a result we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world we actively manage material currency exposures that are associated with purchases and sales and other assets and liabilities at the operating unit level those exposures that cannot be naturally offset to an insignificant amount are hedged with foreign currency derivatives derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes to minimize the risk of counter party nonperformance derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments 

we evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates based on the firmly committed currency derivative instruments in place at december 31 2013  a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10 adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately  233 million  as compared with  42 million  at december 31 2012  these amounts when realized would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions 

venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under us gaap as a result the us dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated joint venture in venezuela any currency remeasurement adjustments for nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings 

in february 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 43 to 63 venezuelan bolivares fuertes vef to 1 us dollar we recognized a 62 million realized foreign currency loss related to the devaluation in the first quarter of 2013 when the government devalued the vef in february 2013 it established a new auctionbased exchange rate market program referred to as sicad the amount of transactions that have run through the sicad and restrictions around participation have limited our access to any foreign exchange rate other than the official rate to pay for imported goods and manage our local monetary asset balances accordingly all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official 63 exchange rate at december 31 2013 

in late january 2014 the venezuelan government made several announcements affecting currency exchange and other controls although the official exchange rate remains at 63 the government announced that the exchange rate for foreign investments will move to the rate available on the sicad currency market which in the last auction was 117 vef to 1 us dollar the impact to us of a devaluation from the official exchange rate to the sicad market exchange rate would approximate 10 million based on net financial asset balances as of december 31 2013there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through sicad and how sicad will operate in the future however we believe there is considerable risk that the official rate will be devalued further further devaluation could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use fixed price contracts to manage this exposure we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december 31 2013  

interest rate exposure 

outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risks a 100 basis point increase in libor would result in an incremental interest expense of annual interest expense of approximately 71 million if the base interest rate in our credit facilities increases in the future then the floatingrate debt could have a material effect on our interest expense
