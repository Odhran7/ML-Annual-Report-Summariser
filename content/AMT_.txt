overview 

we are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 we also offer towerrelated services in the united states which we refer to as our services operations these services include site application zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites our customers include our tenants licensees and other payers 

since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators and as discussed further below we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the united states that we lease primarily to enterprises network operators cloud providers and supporting service providers 

in 2021 we added approximately 31000 communications sites to our portfolios in latin america and europe and launched operations in spain as part of our transaction with telxius telecom sa “telxius” and the acquisition the “telxius acquisition” as further discussed in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” in addition we launched operations in the philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in kirtonkhola tower bangladesh limited the “bangladesh acquisition” as of december 31 2021 our communications real estate portfolio of 220131 communications sites included 43308 communications sites in the us  canada 75725 communications sites in asiapacific 22165 communications sites in africa 30041 communications sites in europe and 48892 communications sites in latin america as well as urban telecommunications assets including fiber in argentina brazil colombia india mexico and south africa and other property interests in australia canada and the united states 

in december 2021 we completed the acquisition of coresite realty corporation “coresite” consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight united states markets for total consideration of 104 billion including the assumption and repayment of coresite’s existing debt the “coresite acquisition” as of december 31 2021 our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten united states markets including the assets acquired as part of the coresite acquisition as well as our previously acquired data center facilities 

in may 2021 and june 2021 in connection with the funding of the telxius acquisition we entered into agreements with caisse de dépôt et placement du québec “cdpq” and allianz insurance companies and funds managed by allianz capital partners gmbh including the allianz european infrastructure fund collectively “allianz” for cdpq and allianz to acquire 30 and 18 noncontrolling interests respectively in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in france germany poland and spain such subsidiaries collectively “atc europe” and the transactions the “atc europe transactions” we completed the atc europe transactions in september 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 26 billion euros “eur” approximately 31 billion at the date of closing after the completion of the atc europe transactions we hold a 52 controlling ownership interest in atc europe 

we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes “reit” accordingly we generally are not required to pay us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our reit income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their classification for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2021 our reitqualified businesses included our us tower leasing business a majority of our us indoor das networks business our services and data centers segments as well as most of our operations in

canada costa rica france germany mexico and nigeria in january 2022 a majority of our operations in ghana kenya south africa and uganda became part of the reit 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of the coresite acquisition we updated our reportable segments to add a data centers segment the data centers segment is included within our property operations we will now report our results in seven segments – us  canada property which includes all assets in the united states and canada other than our data center facilities and related assets asiapacific property africa property europe property latin america property data centers and services we believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments this change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods historical financial information included in this annual report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to the fourth quarter of 2021 we owned one data center

property operations 

our property operations accounted for 97 99 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed under longterm lease agreements with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

• longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in most of our international markets or a combination of both based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2021 we expect to generate over 61 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting 

• consistent demand for our sites as a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth 

• high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality historically churn has averaged approximately 1 to 2 of tenant billings per year we define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or in limited circumstances when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prioryear tenant billings as discussed in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in india we anticipate that our churn rate in our asiapacific property segment will moderate over time however in the immediate term we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as among other things our tenants in india evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the supreme court of india and determine their obligations under payment plans for the adjusted gross revenue “agr” fees and charges prescribed by such court as further discussed in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—our business and that of our customers is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape” additionally we expect that our churn rate in our us  canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations

and nonrenewals pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with tmobile us inc “tmobile” and the agreement the “tmobile mla” entered into in september 2020 

• high operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants or equipment are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or power and fuel costs are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base 

• low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites 

our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks the leasing of property interests and in select markets the operation of fiber the operation of data centers and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue for the years ended december 31 

communications sites approximately 95 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites excluding das networks for each of the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each property segment are as follows for the year ended december 31 2021 

• us  canada att inc “att” tmobile and verizon wireless accounted for an aggregate of 88 of us  canada property segment revenue 

• asiapacific vodafone idea limited bharti airtel limited “airtel” and reliance jio accounted for an aggregate of 89 of asiapacific property segment revenue 

• africa airtel and mtn group limited “mtn” accounted for an aggregate of 73 of africa property segment revenue 

• europe telefónica sa “telefónica” and bouygues accounted for an aggregate of 74 of europe property segment revenue 

• latin america att telefónica and américa móvil accounted for an aggregate of 60 of latin america property segment revenue 

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks fiber and related assets data centers and related assets property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites provide the right to use fiber operate data center facilities and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites the balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items 

• managed networks we own and operate das networks in the united states and certain international markets we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer a small portfolio of outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the united states and in certain 

table of conten ts 

international markets typically we have designed built and operated our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites such as macro tower sites we also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation as the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas 

• fiber and related assets we own and operate fiber and related assets in certain international markets we currently provide the right to use such fiber and related assets to communications and internet service providers and thirdparty operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest selectively in and expand these and other similar assets in the future as part of advanced network deployments 

• data centers and related assets as a result of our recent data center acquisitions we own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the united states which consist of specialized and secure buildings that house networking storage and communications technology infrastructure including servers storage devices switches routers and fiber optic transmission equipment these buildings are designed to provide the power cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate this equipment data centers located at points where many communications networks converge can also function as interconnection hubs where customers are able to connect to multiple networks cloud companies and other service providers to exchange traffic and interoperate with each other 

• property interests  we own portfolios of property interests in australia canada and the united states including land under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provide recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements 

• shared generators  we have contracts with certain of our tenants in the united states pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators 

services operations 

we offer towerrelated services in the united states including site application zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 3 1 and 2 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

site application zoning and permitting  we engage in site application services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

as the use of wireless services on handsets tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to capture this demand our primary operational focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve our operational performance and efficiency including through platform expansion initiatives and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts to meet our customers’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new customers or to existing customers for new uses and those that increase our operational efficiency 

table of conten ts 

• increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity we believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers as a result we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment in the united states incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4g network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5g network deployments in our international markets carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4g and in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology 5g while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks we believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites 

• invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers’ needs we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program and acquisitions a significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels and therefore drive strong returns on those assets more recently we have invested in strategic data center assets including through the coresite acquisition which we believe can drive strong recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future 

• further improve our operational performance and efficiency we continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis we are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives we also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time 

• maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to disciplined financial policies which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade credit ratings we continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and as of december 31 2021 had 61 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business 

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies 

• capital expenditure program we expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction land interest acquisitions and power solutions 

• acquisitions we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our riskadjusted return on investment criteria the riskadjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk among others 

• return excess capital to stockholders  if we have excess capital available after funding i our required distributions ii capital expenditures iii the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and iv anticipated future investments including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders including through our stock repurchase programs 

table of conten ts 

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 

• country analysis prior to entering a new market we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends demographics capital markets tax regime and investment alternatives and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regime 

• wireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market this includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include i multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and ii ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions 

• opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our riskadjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region 

regulatory matters 

towers antennas and fiber our us and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration permitting and public listings in india our subsidiary atc telecom infrastructure private limited “atc tipl” holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war additionally in 2018 atc tipl issued nonconvertible debentures which are listed on the national stock exchange of india although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation atc tipl is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange 

in asiapacific our subsidiaries in the philippines and bangladesh are required to hold a registration or license in order to establish manage and operate passive telecommunications infrastructure services 

in africa our subsidiaries in burkina faso ghana kenya niger nigeria and uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers additionally in uganda our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of our acquisition in 2019 of eaton towers holdings limited 

in latin america our subsidiary in chile holds a license for the provision of passive telecommunications infrastructure and our subsidiary in argentina holds a license for the leasing of fiber the subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in mexico and brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly 

table of conten ts 

the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in kenya our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 30 of their shares to kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained to extend such period of compliance by a year in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

data centers  our us data center facilities and related assets are subject to various federal state and local regulations such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and americans with disabilities act “ada” federal requirements if one of our properties is not in compliance with these regulations we may be required to make significant unanticipated expenditures in order to comply with such regulations andor pay fines or civil damage awards existing regulations may subsequently change or future regulations may be enacted either of which could have a similar impact as described above and could materially and adversely affect our operations 

environmental matters our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes the siting of our towers and the maintenance of our data center facilities we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our tower sites andor data center facilities with respect to our data center facilities the presence of contamination asbestos mold or other air quality issues or the failure to remediate contamination asbestos mold or other air quality issues at our facilities may expose us to thirdparty liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and in other countries where we operate before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

the us environmental protection agency or epa and some of the states and localities in which we operate have also enacted certain climate change laws and regulations andor have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions and may adopt new regulations related to the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel or renewable energy sources to power energy resources that serve our data centers efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional 

table of conten ts 

electricity our data centers require and consume significant amounts of power including electricity generated by the burning of fossil fuels these laws regulations and stakeholder requests could limit our ability to develop new facilities or result in substantial compliance maintenance repair retrofit and construction costs including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment changes in regulations that affect electric power providers such as regulations related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate changerelated matters could adversely affect the costs of electric power and increase our operating costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations or those of our customers 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure and air quality issues additionally and in response to various national state and local laws and guidance enacted in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we implemented workfromhome arrangements and travel restrictions for our employees where practicable as well as and other modifications to our business practices 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures our data center business also competes with a variety of companies offering similar data center solutions and services including space power interconnection and development services we believe that location and capacity network andor interconnection density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites and data center facilities 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site application consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project

risks related to our business strategy 

a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

• increased mergers consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or communications service providers 

• the financial condition of communications service providers including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• zoning environmental health tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof 

• governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our customers’ spectrum licenses 

• a decrease in demand for wireless or colocation services including due to general economic conditions disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social political or health crises such as the material adverse effect of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and markets 

• the ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure 

• delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies and 

• technological changes 

if our customers consolidate their operations exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our customers could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other customers could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases or related payments with us in the event a customer terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed for example see our discussion of carrier consolidationdriven churn in our asiapacific property segment and churn as a result of the tmobile mla in our us  canada property segment in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” 

in addition extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5g as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the customers’ networks may become redundant 

table of conten ts 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers if any of these customers are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 

one or more of our customers or their parent companies may experience financial difficulties file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn economic difficulties including those from the imposition of taxes fees regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations and any associated penalties or interest which may be substantial or otherwise the ongoing covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our customers through disruptions of among other things their ability to procure their equipment through their supply chains and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset tenantrelated intangible asset or goodwill the loss of significant customers or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our customer leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our customers many communications service providers operate with substantial levels of debt in our international operations many of our customers are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by factors such as the covid19 pandemic inflation rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints they may reduce their spending file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications infrastructure and our services business 

in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our customers however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those customers a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those customers that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives in leasing communications infrastructure assets competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets including data center facilities and related assets in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences conflicting policies procedures and operations additionally temporary business closures social distancing measures and the potential unavailability of key personnel or a significant number of our employees as a result of covid19 are difficult to predict and may have a negative impact on the timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel significant acquisitionrelated integration 

table of conten ts 

costs including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees integrating information technology systems acquiring permits and visiting inspecting engineering and upgrading tower sites or other communications infrastructure assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid some of our acquired portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications including sites that may be overburdened in these cases beyond additional capital expenditures general liability risks associated with such portfolios will exist until such time as those portfolios are upgraded or otherwise remedied in addition integration may significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described above as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar local laws 

moreover we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity if we are not able to meet these integration challenges we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

for example failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired assets from the telxius acquisition the “telxius assets” into our operations may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations integrating acquired portfolios of the telxius assets may require significant resources including increased attention from our management team further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid the integration of the telxius assets which includes approximately 31000 international communications sites into our operations continues to be a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result additional integration challenges include 

• transitioning all data related to the telxius assets tenants and landlords to a common information technology system 

• successfully transitioning the lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes and 

• maintaining our standards controls procedures and policies with respect to the telxius assets 

as a result of our acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if as a result of the factors noted above the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge in the period the determination is made 

our platform expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives 

in addition as we continue to invest in partnership opportunities to support our expansion initiatives our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could present governance challenges with multiple partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that partnership or to execute buyouts of their interests 

failure to successfully and efficiently integrate and operate acquired data center facilities and related assets including those acquired through the coresite acquisition the “coresite assets” into our operations may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

integrating acquired data center facilities and related assets may require significant resources including increased attention from our management team further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid the integration of the coresite assets which includes over 20 data centers across eight united states metro areas into our operations will be a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result additional integration challenges include but are not limited to 

• retaining existing customers at the coresite assets 

• unexpected costs associated with successfully developing and expanding the coresite assets 

• failure to recruit or retain key personnel 

• maintaining our standards controls procedures and policies with respect to the coresite assets and 

• successfully marketing space on the coresite assets which will depend on a variety of factors including i the demand for data center space ii internet gateway facilities or other technologyrelated real estate iii the presence of 

table of conten ts 

multiple network carriers and cloud operators in our facilities iv the mix of products and services offered by us v the overall mix of customers vi the presence of key customers attracting business through vertical market ecosystems vii each data center’s operating reliability and security and viii our ability to effectively market and sell our services 

additionally we may fail to successfully operate the data centers we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we must safeguard our customers’ infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers and ensure our data centers remain operational at all times problems at one or more of our data centers whether or not within our control could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage these could result from numerous factors including human error equipment failure physical electronic and cyber security breaches fire earthquake hurricane flood tornado and other natural disasters extreme temperatures water damage fiber cuts power loss terrorist acts sabotage and vandalism global pandemics or health emergencies such as the covid19 pandemic and failure of business partners 

we have service level commitment obligations to certain customers as a result service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures because our data centers are critical to many of our customers’ businesses service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers in addition any loss of service equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results furthermore we are dependent upon internet service providers telecommunications carriers and utility providers some of which have experienced significant system failures and outages in the past our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings if for any reason these providers fail to provide the required services our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

new technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a customer’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies then customers may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our customers’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our customers’ network investments away from traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a customer may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results similarly our data center site infrastructure may become antiquated due to the development of new systems that deliver power to or eliminate heat from the servers and other customer equipment that we house or the development of new technology that requires levels of power and cooling density that our facilities are not designed to provide our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a customer’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business results of operations or financial condition conversely we may invest significant capital in technologies platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of communications infrastructure assets or contracts to build new communications infrastructure assets for customers which could make the acquisition of highquality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition some of our data center competitors have significant advantages over us including greater name recognition longer operating histories lower operating costs lower levels of leverage preexisting relationships with current or potential customers greater financial marketing and other resources access to better networks and access to less expensive power these advantages could allow our data center competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities and as a 

table of conten ts 

result we may lose existing or potential data center customers incur costs to improve our properties or be forced to reduce our rental rates these risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year 

risks related to our financial performance or general economic conditions 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations including as a result of our recent coresite acquisition and telxius acquisition could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures and reit distributions 

• impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources including with respect to acquiring assets and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete 

we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives required purchases of our partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements including financial ratio covenants an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

further market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as covid19 inflation rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities or impact the terms of any new obligations which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings the extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation 

rising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land materials labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our returns could be adversely affected in an inflationary environment such as the current economic environment depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which would reduce our profit margins and returns if we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates the impact of covid19 may increase uncertainty in the global financial markets as well as the possibility of high inflation and extended economic downturn which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the 

table of conten ts 

servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower or other communications infrastructure development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities our credit agreements also contain crossdefault andor crossacceleration provisions which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds in the event of such a default the resulting crossdefaults or crossaccelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices the method in which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced plans to phase out certain libor rates by june 2023 as contemplated the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be assured after june 2023 and libor will cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking while our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event libor is unavailable the elimination of libor could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition financial institutions may replace libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements the secured overnight financing rate however no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported before june 2023 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere furthermore the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs including increased interest expense and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future we cannot predict the effect of the fca’s decision not to sustain libor or if changes ultimately are made to libor the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition 

risks related to laws and regulations 

our business and that of our customers is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape 

our business and that of our customers is subject to federal state local and foreign laws treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions in certain jurisdictions these regulations laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands existing or new regulatory policies regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue in addition in certain jurisdictions we and certain of our customers are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license additionally we have government customers for several of our communications sites and data centers which subjects us to risks including early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties 

in addition federal state and local governments in many of our markets have recently taken actions to contain the spread of covid19 including travel bans quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns among others and may take 

table of conten ts 

additional actions in the future in response to governmental actions we have taken a variety of measures including providing support for our customers remotely supporting continued workfromhome arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices these governmental actions could remain effective for a prolonged period of time with potential material adverse impacts on our and our customers’ business operations moreover while the restrictions and limitations noted above may be relaxed or rolled back if and when covid19 abates or vaccinations become more prevalent such government actions may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve and in response to actual or potential resurgences including due to emerging variants the scope and timing of any such reinstatement is difficult to predict and may materially and adversely affect our operations in the future 

furthermore the tax laws regulations applicable license terms and conditions and interpretations governing our business and that of our customers in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time potentially with retroactive effect this includes changes in tax laws spectrum use terms administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof for example the definition and application of agr in india and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us changes in laws regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable reit subsidiaries these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• uncertain inconsistent or changing laws regulations rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications infrastructure or our international acquisitions any of which laws fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay 

• failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied 

• expropriation resulting in government takeover of customer operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture 

• laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation 

• changes to zoning regulations or construction laws which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications infrastructure 

• actions restricting or revoking our customers’ spectrum licenses or alterations or interpretations thereof or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses 

• failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the fcpa or similar local antibribery laws or the office of foreign assets control requirements 

• failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information 

• material site issues related to security fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids 

• significant increases in or implementation of new license surcharges on our revenue 

• loss of key personnel including expatriates in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire and 

• pricesetting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure 

we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from the impacts of covid19 on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates which has increased in the last few years as a result of uncertainties caused by covid19 can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

table of conten ts 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates which could be substantial in amount and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and accordingly may reduce funds available for other purposes and 

• we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of reits for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

furthermore we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary reits which must also comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then the subsidiary reit would be subject to federal income tax which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest in addition our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and no more than 25 of the value of the assets of the reit may be represented by nonqualifying assets including securities of one or more trss this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater

contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements further our data center properties are subject to various federal state and local regulations such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and ada federal requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements 

the requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs fines or penalties 

risks related to the operation of our business 

our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters including as a result of climate change and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage or result in increased insurance premiums 

our towers fiber networks data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as hurricanes ice and windstorms tornadoes floods earthquakes and wildfires as well as other unforeseen events such as the potential adverse effects of covid19 or other pandemics and acts of terrorism during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our customers under our contractual obligations typically through dieselpowered generators in emerging markets additional environmental liabilities such as contamination asbestoscontaining building materials and mold or other air quality issues at some of our data centers could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance 

in addition governmental initiatives to address climate change and future initiatives could if adopted require us and our customers to make capital expenditures to be compliant with these initiatives and increase our and our customers’ costs failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could also lead to fines andor lost revenue we could also face a negative impact on our reputation with the public and our customers if we violate climate change laws or regulations in october 2021 we adopted sciencebased targets which were approved by the science based targets initiative and are in line with the goals set forth in the 2015 paris agreement these goals may require us to expend significant resources to meet them which could increase our operational costs failing to meet these goals could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation with our key stakeholders which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

further any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems as a result of measures implemented in response to covid19 or otherwise may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our customers and lead to customer loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition and also our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5g networks is linked to adverse health effects 

while we maintain insurance coverage for certain natural disasters and business interruption we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event lost revenue including from new customers that could have been added to our towers fiber networks or data centers but for the event or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event such was wildfire damage caused by our towers further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 

if we or third parties on which we rely experience technology failures including cybersecurity incidents or the loss of personally identifiable information we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences which may include reputational damage 

as part of our normal business activities including in our data centers we rely on energy systems communication networks information technology and other computing resources we may be vulnerable to physical or cybersecurity breaches that could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results we face risks

associated with unauthorized access to our or our vendors’ computer systems loss or destruction of data computer viruses malware distributed denialofservice attacks or other malicious activities these threats may result from human error equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties a party who is able to compromise the security measures on our or our vendors’ networks or the security of our communications infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our employees or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers’ operations as we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security 

globally the frequency severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased and these trends may continue we are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes however there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents as techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target we or our vendors may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or implement security measures in a timely manner if and when implemented we or our vendors may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits regulatory penalties loss of existing or potential customers damage relating to loss of proprietary information harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results we offer managed services in certain of our data centers where we provide “smart hands” services for our customers the access to our customers’ networks and data which is gained from these services creates some risk that our customers’ networks or data will be improperly accessed if we were held responsible for any such breach it could result in a significant loss to us including damage to our customer relationships harm to our brand and reputation and legal liability additionally while we maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs in the event of a breach resulting in loss of data such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws and we may be liable for damages fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks 

although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations including our ability to correctly record process and report financial information our customers’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our customers or landlords or customer information on our fiber data center or managed networks businesses which could result in a loss of revenue damage to our reputation damage to our customer and vendor relationships litigation regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues in addition our recent acquisitions including our acquisitions of data centers may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks including claims that the deployment of 5g networks is linked to adverse health effects could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our customers and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to

we do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all though we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases expire failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs including as a result of the current inflationary environment would adversely impact our operating income we could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases additionally we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers if such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers which could be disruptive to our business 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to do so if we do not exercise these purchase rights and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers

as of december 31 2021 we owned and operated a portfolio of 220131 communications sites including 1778 das networks see the table in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites in addition we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators in canada and the united states which are included in our us  canada property segment and in australia which are included in our asiapacific property segment and also own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the united states which are included in our data centers segment 

our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities 

a typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and in some cases one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment in addition many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets the principal types of our towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole and rooftop towers in our international markets 

• a guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2000 feet a typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres 

• a selfsupporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs a lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1000 feet although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet depending on the height of the tower a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2500 square feet for a metropolitan site 

• a monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet a monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2500 square feet

ground leases of the 218353 towers in our portfolio as of december 31 2021 approximately 90 were located on land we lease typically we seek to enter longterm ground leases which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods as a result 41 of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2031 and beyond 

customers  our customers are primarily wireless service providers broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries for the year ended december 31 2021 our top three customers by total revenue were tmobile 20 att 19 and verizon wireless 13 

across most of our markets our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms as a result approximately 64 of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2027 or beyond 

data centers we own and operate data center facilities and related assets and as of december 31 2021 our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten united states markets including the assets acquired as part of the coresite acquisition as well as our previously acquired data center facilities across 31 million net rentable square feet “nrsf”

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of the coresite acquisition we updated our reportable segments to add a data centers segment the data centers segment is included within our property operations we will now report our results in seven segments – us  canada property which includes all assets in the united states and canada other than our data center facilities and related assets asiapacific property africa property europe property latin america property data centers and services we believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments this change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods historical financial information included in this annual report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to to the fourth quarter of 2021 we owned one data center 

in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators and as discussed further below we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the united states our customers include our tenants licensees and other payers we refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations which accounted for 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 and includes our us  canada property asiapacific property africa property europe property and latin america property segments and data centers segment 

we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site application zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

table of conten ts 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites that we owned or operated as of december 31 2021     

1 approximately 95 of the operated towers are held pursuant to longterm finance leases including those subject to purchase options 

2 we also control land under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites in australia which provides recurring cash flow through tenant leasing arrangements 

in january 2021 we entered into the telxius acquisition pursuant to which we agreed to acquire telxius’ european and latin american tower divisions comprising approximately 31000 communications sites in argentina brazil chile germany peru and spain for approximately 77 billion eur approximately 94 billion at the date of signing subject to certain adjustments we completed the acquisition of nearly 27000 communications sites in june 2021 and acquired the approximately 4000 remaining communications sites in germany in august 2021 for total consideration of approximately 79 billion eur approximately 96 billion as of the closing dates subject to certain postclosing adjustments 

in december 2021 we completed the coresite acquisition through which we acquired over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight united states markets for total consideration of 104 billion including the assumption and repayment of coresite’s existing debt 

as of december 31 2021 our property portfolio included 27 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the united states that collectively comprise approximately 31 million nrsf of data center space as detailed below   

1 excludes approximately 04 million of office and lightindustrial nrsf acquired as part of the coresite acquisition 

in most of our markets our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2021 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically based on an annual fixed escalation averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in most of our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

based upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2021 we expect to generate over 61 billion of noncancellable customer lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the nonrenewal of leases or rent renegotiations which we refer to as churn has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations during the year ended december 31 2021 churn was approximately 4 of our tenant billings 

beginning in late 2017 we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or nonrenewals primarily due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in india which compressed our gross margin and operating profit particularly in our asiapacific property segment although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites for the year ended december 31 2021 aggregate carrier consolidation in india did not have a material impact on our consolidated property revenue gross margin or operating profit although overall churn rates in india remained elevated relative to historical levels 

we anticipate that our churn rate in india will moderate over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue gross margin and operating profit in the immediate term we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as our tenants in india evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the supreme court of india and determine their obligations under payment plans for the agr fees and charges prescribed by such court as further discussed in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—our business and that of our customers is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape” we expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our indian assets which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges for more information please see the information under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

additionally we expect that our churn rate in our us  canada property segment will remain elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and nonrenewals by tmobile including legacy sprint corporation leases pursuant to the terms of the tmobile mla entered into in september 2020 

as further set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” the ongoing covid19 pandemic as well as the response to mitigate its spread and effects may adversely impact us and our customers and the demand for our communications infrastructure in the united states and globally we have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications infrastructure assets while ensuring the safety and security of our employees customers 

table of conten ts 

vendors and surrounding communities these measures include providing support for our customers remotely supporting continued workfromhome arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures which are often reimbursed to us 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are 

• growth in tenant billings including 

• new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites “colocations” and lease amendments 

• contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of churn and 

• new revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prioryear period 

• revenue growth from our data centers segment in the united states including growth attributable to increased customer demand for space power and interconnection services and solutions 

• revenue growth from other items including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases “passthrough” straightline revenue and decommissioning 

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions according to industry data recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged at least 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

• in less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks we have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term 

• subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration the proliferation of bandwidthintensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem we believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage 

• the deployment of advanced mobile technology such as 4g and 5g will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution as a result we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks 

• wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue to deploy 

table of conten ts 

additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage 

• wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum we expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higherband spectrum such as 25 gigahertz ghz and cband being deployed for 5g as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lowerband spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers 

• next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us these technologies may include edge computing functionality autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internetofthings or iot applications as well as other potential use cases for wireless services these technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time although these use cases are currently in nascent stages 

• continued data growth and emerging highperformance latencysensitive applications will drive an increased need for reliable secure and interconnected data center solutions we believe these trends will result in incremental utilization and interconnection demand at our data center facilities 

as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets we believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will over the long term position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as bangladesh burkina faso ghana india kenya niger nigeria the philippines and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in india the ongoing transition from 2g technology to 4g technology has included a period of carrier consolidation whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace which we believe is now substantially complete we believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that will be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa poland and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are increasingly focused on 4g network deployments consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as australia canada germany france and spain carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity as well as the early stages of 5g deployment 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will be replicated in our international markets over time as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 177000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have master lease agreements with many of our tenants for our communications sites that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of noncontractual churn certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites

demand for our communications infrastructure assets could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our customers as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the captions “risk factors—if our customers consolidate their operations exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results” further our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications infrastructure assets 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2021 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 38950 communications sites globally in a majority of our asiapacific africa europe and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 



during the year ended december 31 2021 we also grew our portfolio of data center facilities through the acquisition of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in the united states including through the coresite acquisition 

property operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our customers as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues

the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

asset retirement obligations— we are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located as of december 31 2021 the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was 42 billion 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

internally generated funds —because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2021 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our

communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications infrastructure 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities —the loan agreements for the 2021 multicurrency credit facility the 2021 credit facility the 2021 term loan the 2021 eur three year delayed draw term loan the 2021 usd 364day delayed draw term loan and the 2021 usd two year delayed draw term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our debt levels 

4 effectively however additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

under the terms of the agreements for the 2021 multicurrency credit facility the 2021 credit facility the 2021 term loan the 2021 eur three year delayed draw term loan the 2021 usd 364day delayed draw term loan and the 2021 usd two year delayed draw term loan the telxius acquisition and the coresite acquisition are designated as a qualified acquisitions whereby our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is adjusted to not exceed 750 to 100 for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the telxius acquisition which began with the quarter ended june 30 2021 and for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the coresite acquisition which began with the quarter ended december 31 2021 the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations— the indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the american tower secured revenue notes series 20152 class a the “series 20152 notes” issued by gtp acquisition partners i llc “gtp acquisition partners” in the 2015 securitization and the loan agreement related to the trust securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things gtp acquisition partners and american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc together the “amt asset subs” are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreements 

under the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the series 20152 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities series 20132a the “series 20132a securities” secured tower revenue securities series 20181 subclass a the “series 20181a securities” and the secured tower revenue securities series 20181 subclass r the “series 20181r securities” and together with the series 20181a securities the “2018 securities” issued in the trust securitizations the “loan” as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the 

table of conten ts 

table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable which can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2021 3588 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations is set forth below the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the series 20152 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination 



 

1 based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of december 31 2021 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the series 20152 notes or the loan as applicable 

2 once triggered a cash trap dscr condition continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters during a cash trap dscr condition all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents referred to as excess cash flow will be deposited into a reserve account the “cash trap reserve account” instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower 

3 an amortization period commences if the dscr is equal to or below 115x the “minimum dscr” at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

4 no amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date however in such event additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow 

5 an amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full 

a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet reit distribution requirements during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay the principal of the series 20152 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the series 20152 notes or subclass of the loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the series 20152 notes upon the occurrence of and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of the series 20152 notes declare the series 20152 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on the series 20152 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3531 communications sites that secure the series 20152 notes or the 5113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and

related assets that secure the loan respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness further as further discussed under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities or impact the terms of any new obligations if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and consequently a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2021 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

• impairment of assets—assets subject to depreciation and amortization  we review longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 

we review our tower portfolio network location intangible and rightofuse assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

in october 2019 the supreme court of india issued a ruling regarding the definition of agr and associated fees and charges which was reaffirmed in march 2020 that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us in september 2020 the supreme court of india defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling in september 2021 the government in india approved a relief package that among other things included i a four year moratorium on the payment of agr fees owed and ii a change in the definition of agr on a prospective basis we will continue to 

table of conten ts 

monitor the status of these developments as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in india could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets including amounts originally recorded as tenantrelated intangibles the carrying value of tenantrelated intangibles in india was 09 billion as of december 31 2021 which represents 6 of our consolidated balance of 150 billion additionally a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in india could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles the carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in india were 10 billion and 3674 million respectively as of december 31 2021 which represent 12 and 9 of our consolidated balances of 90 billion and 40 billion respectively 

• impairment of assets—goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess the loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

during the year ended december 31 2021 no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount 

• acquisitions  we evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination for those transactions treated as asset acquisitions the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition 

• revenue recognition our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites the land on which the sites are located and our data center facilities the “lease component” and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights the “nonlease component” most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the nonlease component differs from the lease component if the timing and pattern of the nonlease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component we separately determine the standalone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation 

our revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease arrangements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straightline calculation total property straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were 4656 million 3220 million and 1835 million respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met 

table of conten ts 

we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry with 52 of our revenues derived from three tenants in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

• rent expense and lease accounting many of the leases underlying our tower sites and data centers have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option our calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured 

we recognize a rightofuse lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases the rightofuse asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability prepaid or accrued lease payments any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts 

the calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation the duration and the present value of the lease liability when calculating the lease term we consider the renewal cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor we determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term 

• income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our reit taxable income 

we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit

overview 

we are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 99 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 we also offer towerrelated services in the united states which we refer to as our services operations these services include site application zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators 

in 2020 we added approximately 3000 communications sites to our portfolio primarily in the united states and launched operations in canada and australia as part of our acquisition of insite wireless group llc “insite” and the acquisition the “insite acquisition” we also launched operations in poland through an agreement to acquire communications sites from electronic control systems spółka akcyjna added 530 communications sites to our portfolio in latin america through our agreement with entel pcs telecomunicaciones sa and entel peru sa the “entel acquisition” and added 564 communications sites to our portfolio in europe through our agreements with orange sa the “orange acquisition” as of december 31 2020 our communications real estate portfolio of 185641 communications sites included 43146 communications sites in the us  canada 75772 communications sites in asiapacific 19863 communications sites in africa 5331 communications sites in europe and 41529 communications sites in latin america as well as urban telecommunications assets in argentina brazil colombia india mexico and south africa and other property interests in the united states and australia 

on january 13 2021 we entered into two agreements with telxius telecom sa “telxius” a subsidiary of telefónica sa pursuant to which we expect to acquire telxius’ european and latin american tower divisions comprising approximately 31000 communications sites in argentina brazil chile germany peru and spain for approximately 77 billion euros “eur” approximately 94 billion at the date of signing the “pending telxius acquisition” subject to limited adjustments the pending telxius acquisition is expected to close in tranches beginning in the second quarter of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions including government and regulatory approval 

we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes “reit” accordingly we generally are not required to pay us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our reit income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their classification for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2020 our reitqualified businesses included our us tower leasing business and a majority of our us indoor das networks business and services segment as well as most of our operations in mexico germany costa rica nigeria france canada and australia 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of the insite acquisition we updated our reportable segments to rename us property and asia property to us  canada property and asiapacific property respectively we continue to report our results in six segments – us  canada property asiapacific property africa property europe property latin america property and services this change was made to better align the names of our reportable segments with the geographical areas of our business operations following the insite acquisition the change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of canada and australia in our business operations as a result of the insite acquisition and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods 

products and services 

property operations 

our property operations accounted for 99 98 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed under longterm lease agreements with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

• longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general our tenant leases with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in most of our international markets or a combination of both based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2020 we expect to generate nearly 59 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting 

• consistent demand for our sites as a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth 

• high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality historically churn has averaged approximately 1 to 2 of tenant billings per year we define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or in limited circumstances when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prioryear tenant billings as discussed in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” we experienced elevated levels of churn in recent years due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in india we anticipate that our churn rate in our asiapacific property segment will moderate over time however in the immediate term we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated primarily due to the recent court rulings by the indian supreme court as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—our business and that of our tenants is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape” additionally we expect that our churn rate in our us  canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and nonrenewals pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with tmobile us inc “tmobile” and the agreement the “tmobile mla” entered into in september 2020 

• high operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants or equipment are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or power and fuel costs are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base 

• low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites 

our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks the leasing of property interests and in select markets the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue for the years 

ended december 31 

communications sites approximately 95 95 and 96 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites excluding das networks for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each property segment are as follows for the year ended december 31 2020 

• us  canada att inc “att” tmobile and verizon wireless accounted for an aggregate of 89 of us  canada property segment revenue 

• asiapacific vodafone idea limited bharti airtel limited “airtel” and reliance jio accounted for an aggregate of 87 of asiapacific property segment revenue 

• africa airtel and mtn group limited “mtn” accounted for an aggregate of 68 of africa property segment revenue 

• europe telefónica sa “telefónica” bouygues and free accounted for an aggregate of 69 of europe property segment revenue 

• latin america att telefónica and américa móvil accounted for an aggregate of 56 of latin america property segment revenue 

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks fiber and related assets property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites provide the right to use fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites the balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items 

• managed networks we own and operate das networks in the united states and certain international markets we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer a small portfolio of outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the united states and in certain international markets typically we have designed built and operated our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites such as macro tower sites we also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation as the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas 

• fiber and related assets we own and operate fiber and related assets in the united states and certain international markets we currently provide the right to use such fiber and related assets to communications and internet service providers and thirdparty operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure we expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest selectively in and expand these and other similar assets in the future as part of advanced network deployments 

• property interests  we own portfolios of property interests in australia canada and the united states including land under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provide recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements 

• shared generators  we have contracts with certain of our tenants in the united states pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators 

services operations 

we offer towerrelated services in the united states including site application zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 1 2 and 2 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

site application zoning and permitting  we engage in site application services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

as the use of wireless services on handsets tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to capture this demand our primary operational focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve our operational performance and efficiency including through platform expansion initiatives and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for new uses and those that increase our operational efficiency 

• increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity we believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers as a result we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment in the united states incremental carrier network activity is being driven by 4g network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5g network deployments in our international markets carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4g and in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology 5g while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks we believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites 

• invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our tenants’ needs we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program new site construction and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive riskadjusted returns by pursuing such investments in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases a significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels and therefore drive strong returns on those assets 

• further improve our operational performance and efficiency we continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our tenants to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis we are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and platform expansion initiatives we also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time 

• maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to disciplined financial policies which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade credit ratings we continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and as of december 31 2020 had 49 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business 

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies 

• capital expenditure program we expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and power solutions 

• acquisitions we intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our riskadjusted return on investment criteria the riskadjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk among others 

• return excess capital to stockholders  if we have excess capital available after funding i our required distributions ii capital expenditures iii the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and iv anticipated future investments including acquisition and select innovation opportunities we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders including through our stock repurchase programs 

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 

• country analysis prior to entering a new market we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends demographics capital markets tax regime and investment alternatives and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regime 

• wireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market this includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include i multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and ii ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions 

• opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our riskadjusted return criteria given the country and the 

counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region 

regulatory matters 

towers antennas and fiber our us and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration permitting and public listings in india our subsidiary atc telecom infrastructure private limited “atc tipl” holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war additionally in 2018 atc tipl issued nonconvertible debentures which are listed on the national stock exchange of india although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation atc tipl is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange 

in africa our subsidiaries in ghana kenya niger nigeria and uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers in burkina faso a new licensing regime was recently enacted which required our subsidiary there to be licensed additionally in uganda our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of our acquisition in 2019 of eaton towers holdings limited “eaton towers” and the acquisition the “eaton towers acquisition” 

in latin america our subsidiaries in chile and argentina hold licenses for the provision of passive telecommunications infrastructure and in argentina for leasing of fiber the subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in mexico and brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in kenya our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 30 of their shares to kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained to extend such period of compliance by a year in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in 

february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

environmental matters our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and in other countries where we operate before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure additionally and in response to various national state and local laws and guidance enacted in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we implemented workfromhome arrangements and travel restrictions for our employees where practicable as well as and other modifications to our business practices 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site application consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

for more information on demand trends in our industry see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview”

 item 1a risk factors tableend

risks related to our business strategy 

a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

• increased mergers consolidations or exits that reduce the number of wireless service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or wireless service providers 

• the financial condition of wireless service providers including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• zoning environmental health tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof 

• governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our tenants’ spectrum licenses 

• a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services including due to general economic conditions disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social political or health crises such as the material adverse effect of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and markets 

• the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure 

• delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies and 

• technological changes 

if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases or related payments with us in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed for example see our discussion of carrier consolidationdriven churn in our asiapacific property segment and our expected churn in our us  canada property segment as a result of the tmobile mla in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” 

in addition extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5g as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 

one or more of our tenants or their parent companies may experience financial difficulties file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn economic difficulties including those from the imposition 

of taxes fees regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations and any associated penalties or interest which may be substantial or otherwise the ongoing covid19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our tenants through disruptions of among other things their ability to procure telecommunications equipment through their supply chains and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset tenantrelated intangible asset or goodwill the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints they may reduce their spending file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business 

in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our tenants however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those tenants a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our returns could be adversely affected 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences conflicting policies procedures and operations additionally temporary business closures social distancing measures and the potential unavailability of key personnel or a significant number of our employees as a result of covid19 are difficult to predict and may have a negative impact on the timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees integrating information technology systems acquiring permits and visiting inspecting engineering and upgrading tower sites or related communications infrastructure assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid some of our acquired tower portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications including sites that may be overburdened in these cases in addition to additional capital expenditures general liability risks associated with such towers will exist until such time as those towers are upgraded or otherwise remedied in addition integration may 

significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described above as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and similar local laws 

additionally failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired assets from the pending telxius acquisition the “telxius assets” into our operations may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations integrating acquired portfolios of the telxius assets may require significant resources including increased attention from our management team further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the periods in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the periods in which any related costs are actually paid the integration of the telxius assets which includes approximately 31000 international communications sites into our operations will be a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges as a result additional integration challenges include 

• transitioning all data related to the telxius assets tenants and landlords to a common information technology system 

• successfully marketing space on the telxius assets 

• successfully transitioning the lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes 

• retaining existing tenants on the telxius assets and 

• maintaining our standards controls procedures and policies with respect to the telxius assets 

additionally we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity if we are not able to meet these integration challenges we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses including the pending telxius acquisition and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

as a result of our acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if as a result of the factors noted above the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge in the period the determination is made 

our platform expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives 

new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies then tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business results of operations or financial condition conversely we may invest significant capital in technologies platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants which could make the acquisition of highquality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to our financial performance or general economic conditions 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations including as a result of our recent insite acquisition and the pending telxius acquisition could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

• requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures and reit distributions 

• impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources including with respect to acquiring assets and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete 

we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives required purchases of our joint venture partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements including financial ratio covenants an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

further extreme market volatility and disruption caused by covid19 may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities or impact the terms of any new obligations which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings the extent to which covid19 will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including 

mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities our credit agreements also contain crossdefault andor crossacceleration provisions which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds in the event of such a default the resulting crossdefaults or crossaccelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices the method in which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced plans to phase out libor rates by the end of 2021 as contemplated the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be assured after 2021 and libor may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking while our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event libor is unavailable the elimination of libor could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition financial institutions may replace libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements the secured overnight financing rate however no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere furthermore the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs including increased interest expense and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future we cannot predict the effect of the fca’s decision not to sustain libor or if changes ultimately are made to libor the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition 

risks related to laws and regulations 

our business and that of our tenants is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape 

our business and that of our tenants is subject to federal state local and foreign laws treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions in certain jurisdictions these regulations laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing or new regulatory policies regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue in addition in certain jurisdictions we and certain of our tenants are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license 

in addition federal state and local governments in many of our markets have recently taken actions to contain the spread of covid19 including travel bans quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns among others and may take additional actions in the future in response to governmental actions we have taken a variety of measures including providing support for our tenants remotely requiring workfromhome arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices these governmental actions could remain effective for a prolonged period of time with potential material adverse impacts on our and our tenants’ business operations moreover while the restrictions and limitations noted above may be relaxed or rolled back if and when covid19 abates or vaccinations become more prevalent such government actions may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve and in response to actual or potential resurgences the scope and timing of any such reinstatement is difficult to predict and may materially and adversely affect our operations in the future 

furthermore the tax laws regulations applicable license terms and conditions and interpretations governing our business and that of our tenants in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time potentially with retroactive effect this includes changes in tax laws spectrum use terms administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof for example the october 2019 ruling of the supreme court of india regarding the definition of adjusted gross revenue “agr” and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us changes in laws regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable reit subsidiaries these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• uncertain inconsistent or changing laws regulations rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions any of which laws fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay 

• failure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied 

• expropriation resulting in government takeover of tenant operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture 

• laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation 

• changes to zoning regulations or construction laws which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites 

• actions restricting or revoking our tenants’ spectrum licenses or alterations or interpretations thereof or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses 

• failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the fcpa or similar local antibribery laws or the office of foreign assets control requirements 

• failure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information 

• material site issues related to security fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids 

• significant increases in or implementation of new license surcharges on our revenue 

• loss of key personnel including expatriates in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire and 

• pricesetting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure 

we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from the impacts of covid19 on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates which has recently increased as a result of uncertainties caused by covid19 can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could present governance challenges with multiple joint venture partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates which could be substantial in amount and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and accordingly may reduce funds available for other purposes and 

• we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of reits for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

furthermore we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary reits which must also comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then the subsidiary reit would be subject to federal income tax which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest in addition our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and no more than 25 of the value of the assets of the reit may be represented by nonqualifying assets including securities of one or more trss this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements 

the requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs fines or penalties 

risks related to the operation of our business 

our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers fiber networks data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as hurricanes ice and wind storms tornadoes floods earthquakes and wildfires as well as other unforeseen events such as the potential adverse effects of covid19 or other pandemics and acts of terrorism during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our tenants under our contractual obligations typically through dieselpowered generators in emerging markets further any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems as a result of measures implemented in response to covid19 or otherwise may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition additionally our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5g networks is linked to adverse health effects 

as part of our normal business activities and in our platform expansion initiatives or managed networks businesses we rely on information technology and other computing resources our computer systems network operation centers or power systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack data theft and exploiting potentially vulnerable services such as virtual private networks and communication and collaboration platforms as a result of increased teleworking activity as a result of covid19 usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations including our ability to correctly record process and report financial information our tenants’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords or tenant information on our platform expansion initiatives or managed networks businesses which could result in a loss of revenue damage to our reputation damage to our tenant and vendor relationships litigation regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues in addition our recent acquisitions including acquisitions of fiber businesses may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters business interruption and cybersecurity we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers fiber networks or data centers but for the event or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks including claims that the deployment of 5g networks is linked to adverse health effects could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating leases further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to do so if we do not exercise these purchase rights and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers

as of december 31 2020 we owned and operated a portfolio of 185641 communications sites including 1781 das networks see the table in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites in addition we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators in canada and the united states which are included in our us  canada property segment and in australia which are included in our asiapacific property segment 

our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities 

a typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and in some cases one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment in addition many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric 

grid connection in select markets the principal types of our towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole and rooftop towers in our international markets 

• a guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2000 feet a typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres 

• a selfsupporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs a lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1000 feet although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet depending on the height of the tower a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2500 square feet for a metropolitan site 

• a monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet a monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2500 square feet 

• rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our asiapacific africa europe and latin america markets where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of the insite acquisition we updated our reportable segments to rename us property and asia property to us  canada property and asiapacific property respectively we continue to report our results in six segments – us  canada property asiapacific property africa property europe property latin america property and 

services this change was made to better align the names of our reportable segments with the geographical areas of our business operations following the insite acquisition the change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of canada and australia in our business operations as a result of the insite acquisition and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods historical financial information included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has not been adjusted 

in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations which accounted for 99 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 and includes our us  canada property asiapacific property africa property europe property and latin america property segments 

we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site application zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites that we owned or operated as of december 31 2020     

1 approximately 95 of the operated towers are held pursuant to longterm finance leases including those subject to purchase options 

2 in december 2020 we launched operations in canada and australia through the insite acquisition in australia we do not own or operate communications sites but control land under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow through tenant leasing arrangements in canada we also control land under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites 

on january 13 2021 we signed agreements for the pending telxius acquisition pursuant to which we expect to acquire approximately 31000 communications sites in argentina brazil chile germany peru and spain for approximately 77 billion eur approximately 94 billion at the time of signing at closing subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments the pending telxius acquisition is expected to close in multiple tranches beginning in the second quarter of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions including government and regulatory approval the impact of the pending telxius acquisition on our 2021 results of operations will be dependent on a number of factors including the timing of any closings 

in most of our markets our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2020 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon existing tenant leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2020 we expect to generate nearly 59 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically based on an annual fixed escalation averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in most of our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the nonrenewal of leases or rent renegotiations which we refer to as churn has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations during the year ended december 31 2020 churn was approximately 3 of our tenant billings 

beginning in late 2017 we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or nonrenewals primarily due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in india which compressed our gross margin and operating profit particularly in our asiapacific property segment although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites for the year ended december 31 2020 aggregate carrier consolidation in india did not have a material impact on our consolidated property revenue gross margin or operating profit although overall churn rates in india remained elevated relative to historical levels 

we anticipate that our churn rate in india will moderate over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue gross margin and operating profit in the immediate term we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as our tenants in india evaluate the recent court rulings by the indian supreme court and determine their payment plans for the agr fees and charges prescribed by such court as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—our business and that of our tenants is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape” we expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our indian assets which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges for more information please see the information under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

additionally we expect that our churn rate in our us  canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and nonrenewals by tmobile including legacy sprint corporation leases pursuant to the terms of the tmobile mla signed in september 2020 

as further set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the captions “risk factors” the ongoing covid19 pandemic as well as the response to mitigate its spread and effects may adversely impact us and our tenants and the demand for our communications sites in the united states and globally we have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications sites while ensuring the safety and security of our employees tenants vendors and surrounding communities these measures include providing support for our tenants remotely requiring workfromhome arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees tenants and business partners 

as a result of the impact of covid19 on global financial markets foreign currency exchange rates have been volatile in many of the markets in which we operate we estimate that the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our consolidated revenue and operating profit in the current period as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 was approximately 315 million and 172 million respectively if exchange rates become significantly more unfavorable the impact to our revenue and other future operating results could be material additionally the impact of covid19 on our operational results in subsequent periods will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time these developments may include but are not limited to new information concerning the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic the degree of success of actions taken to contain or treat covid19 including the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments and the reactions by consumers companies governmental entities and capital markets to such actions 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures which are often reimbursed to us 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are 

• growth in tenant billings including 

• new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites “colocations” and lease amendments 

• contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of churn and 

• new revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prioryear period 

• revenue growth from other items including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases “passthrough” straightline revenue and decommissioning 

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions according to industry data recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged at least 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

• in less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks we have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term 

• subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration the proliferation of bandwidthintensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem we believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage 

• the deployment of advanced mobile technology such as 4g and 5g will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution as a result we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks 

• wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage 

• wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum we expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higherband spectrum such as 25 gigahertz ghz and cband being deployed for 5g as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lowerband spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers 

• next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us these technologies may include edge computing functionality autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internetofthings or iot applications as well as other potential use cases for wireless services these technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time although these use cases are currently in nascent stages 

as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term for example as part of our pending telxius acquisition we expect to increase our exposure to more developed markets in europe in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets we believe that consistent 

carrier network investments across our international markets will over the long term position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as burkina faso ghana india kenya niger nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in india the ongoing transition from 2g technology to 4g technology has included a period of carrier consolidation whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace which we believe is now substantially complete we believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that will be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa poland and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are increasingly focused on 4g network deployments consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as australia canada germany france and following the expected closing of our pending telxius acquisition spain carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity as well as the early stages of 5g deployment 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will be replicated in our international markets over time as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 143000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have master lease agreements with many of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of noncontractual churn certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the captions “risk factors—if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results” further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2020 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 9365 sites globally in a majority of our asiapacific africa europe and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 



property operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated adjusted funds from operations “consolidated affo” and affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss from equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interests in this section we refer to nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “nareit ffo common stockholders” 

we define consolidated affo as nareit ffo common stockholders before i straightline revenue and expense ii stockbased compensation expense iii the deferred portion of income tax iv nonreal estate related depreciation amortization and accretion v amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and longterm deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interests less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures 

we define affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as consolidated affo excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both nareit ffo common stockholders and the other adjustments included in the calculation of consolidated affo in this section we refer to affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “affo common stockholders” 

adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap none of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo or affo common stockholders represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure 

used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance 2 adjusted ebitda is a component underlying our credit ratings 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 consolidated affo is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust nareit ffo common stockholders for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in nareit ffo common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods 5 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 6 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies particularly those in our industry

stockholders including the dividend paid in february 2021 primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified reit dividends under section 199a of the code for taxable years ending before 2026 

the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

internally generated funds —because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2020 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities —the loan agreements for the 2019 multicurrency credit facility the 2019 credit facility the 2019 term loan and the 2021 delayed draw term loans contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below as 

of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our debt levels 

4 effectively however additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

under the terms of the agreements for the 2019 multicurrency credit facility the 2019 credit facility the 2019 term loan and the 2021 delayed draw term loans the pending telxius acquisition is designated as a qualified acquisition whereby our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is adjusted to not exceed 750 to 100 for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the pending telxius acquisition the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations— the indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the american tower secured revenue notes series 20152 class a the “series 20152 notes” issued by gtp acquisition partners i llc “gtp acquisition partners” in a private securitization transaction in may 2015 the “2015 securitization” and the loan agreement related to the securitization transactions completed in march 2013 the “2013 securitization” and march 2018 the “2018 securitization” and together with the 2013 securitization the “trust securitizations” include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things gtp acquisition partners and american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc together the “amt asset subs” are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreements 

under the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the series 20152 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities series 20132a the “series 20132a securities” secured tower revenue securities series 20181 subclass a the “series 20181a securities” and the secured tower revenue securities series 20181 subclass r the “series 20181r securities” and together with the series 20181a securities the “2018 securities” issued in the trust securitizations the “loan” as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable which can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2020 810 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations is set forth below the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the series 20152 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination 



 

1 based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of december 31 2020 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the series 20152 notes or the loan as applicable 

2 on the june 2020 payment date the series 20151 notes were repaid in full as of december 31 2020 none of the series 20151 notes remained outstanding 

3 once triggered a cash trap dscr condition continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters during a cash trap dscr condition all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents referred to as excess cash flow will be deposited into a reserve account the “cash trap reserve account” instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower 

4 an amortization period commences if the dscr is equal to or below 115x the “minimum dscr” at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

5 no amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date however in such event additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow 

6 an amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full 

a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet reit distribution requirements during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay principal of the series 20152 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the series 20152 notes or subclass of the loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the series 20152 notes upon the occurrence of and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of the series 20152 notes declare the series 20152 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on the series 20152 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3538 communications sites that secure the series 20152 notes or the 5114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the loan respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness additionally as further discussed under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic 

may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities or impact the terms of any new obligations if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2020 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

• impairment of assets—assets subject to depreciation and amortization  we review longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 

we review our tower portfolio network location intangible and rightofuse assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

in october 2019 the supreme court of india issued a ruling regarding the definition of agr and associated fees and charges which was reaffirmed in march 2020 that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us in september 2020 the supreme court of india defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling we will continue to monitor the status of these developments as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in india could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets including amounts originally recorded as tenantrelated intangibles the carrying value of tenantrelated intangibles in india was 10 billion as of december 31 2020 which represents 10 of our consolidated balance of 101 billion additionally a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in india could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles the carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in india were 10 billion and 4109 million respectively as of december 31 2020 which represent 13 and 11 of our consolidated balances of 80 billion and 37 billion respectively 

• impairment of assets—goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess the loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

during the year ended december 31 2020 no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount 

• asset retirement obligations when required we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located generally the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date 

we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 650 million during the year ended december 31 2020 the change in 2020 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

• acquisitions  we evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination for those transactions treated as asset acquisitions the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition 

• revenue recognition our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites and the land on which the sites are located the “lease component” and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights the “nonlease component” most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the nonlease component differs from the lease component if the timing and pattern of the nonlease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component we separately determine the standalone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation 

our revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease arrangements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straightline calculation total property straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were 3220 million 1835 million and 876 million 

respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met 

we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry with 55 of our revenues derived from three tenants in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

• rent expense and lease accounting many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option our calculation of the lease liability includes straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured 

effective january 1 2019 we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date the new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a rightofuse lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases the rightofuse asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability prepaid or accrued lease payments any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts 

the calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation the duration and the present value of the lease liability when calculating the lease term we consider the renewal cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor we determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term 

• income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our reit taxable income 

we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit

overview 

we are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  we also offer towerrelated services in the united states which we refer to as our services operations these services include site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 

since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators 

in 2019 we added approximately 5800 communications sites to our portfolio in africa and launched operations in burkina faso and niger as part of our acquisition of eaton towers holdings limited “eaton towers” and the acquisition the “eaton towers acquisition” we also signed a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3200 communications sites in chile and peru from entel pcs telecomunicaciones sa and entel peru sa and closed on the first tranche of sites adding approximately 2400 communications sites to our portfolio in latin america the “entel acquisition” the remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches beginning in the first quarter of 2020 subject to certain closing conditions as of december 31 2019  our communications real estate portfolio of 179520 communications sites included 40974 communications sites in the us 74712 communications sites in asia 18370 communications sites in africa 4736 communications sites in europe and 40728 communications sites in latin america as well as urban telecommunications assets in argentina brazil india mexico and south africa 

we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes “reit” accordingly we generally are not required to pay us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our reit income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their classification for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2019  our reitqualified businesses included our us tower leasing business and a majority of our us indoor das networks business and services segment as well as most of our operations in mexico germany costa rica nigeria and france 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of recent acquisitions including the eaton towers acquisition and changes to our organizational structure we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our europe middle east and africa “emea” property segment into two separate segments africa property and europe property we now report our results in six segments – us property asia property africa property europe property latin america property and services we believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments and better aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments 

  

products and services 

property operations 

our property operations accounted for 98  98 and 99 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed under longterm lease agreements with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks the leasing of property interests and in select markets the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of consolidated total revenue 

for the years ended december 31 

communications sites approximately 95 96 and 97 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites excluding das networks for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended december 31 2019  

 accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests fiber and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites provide the right to use fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites the balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items

we offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 2  2 and 1 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

as the use of wireless services on handsets tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to capture this demand our primary operational focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve our operational performance and efficiency including through innovation initiatives and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for new uses and those that increase our operational efficiency 



properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels and therefore drive strong returns on those assets 

 capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies 

 international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 





regulatory matters 

towers antennas and fiber our us and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 56 of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration permitting and public listings in india our subsidiary atc telecom infrastructure private limited “atc tipl” holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war additionally in 2018 atc tipl issued nonconvertible debentures which are listed on the national stock exchange of india although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation atc tipl is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange 

in africa our subsidiaries in ghana kenya niger nigeria and uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers in burkina faso a new licensing regime was recently enacted which will require any subsidiary there to be licensed in 2020 additionally in uganda our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of the eaton towers acquisition 

in latin america our subsidiaries in chile and argentina hold licenses for the provision of passive telecommunications infrastructure and in argentina for leasing of fiber the subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in mexico and brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in kenya our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 20 of their shares to kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action 

by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

environmental matters our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and in other countries where we operate before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project

risk factors 

tableend

a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

 if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases or related payments with us in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed for example see our discussion of carrier consolidationdriven churn in our asia segment in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” in addition extensive sharing of site 

infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 

one or more of our tenants or their parent companies may experience financial difficulties file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn economic difficulties including those from the imposition of taxes fees regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations and any associated penalties or interest which may be substantial such as those imposed in india as a result of the october 2019 indian supreme court ruling regarding the definition of adjusted gross revenue “agr” and associated fees and charges or otherwise such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset tenantrelated intangible asset or goodwill the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints they may reduce their spending file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business 

in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those tenants a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business and that of our tenants is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape 

our business and that of our tenants is subject to federal state local and foreign laws treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions in certain jurisdictions these regulations laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing or new regulatory policies regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue in addition in certain jurisdictions we and certain of our tenants are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license 

furthermore the tax laws regulations applicable license terms and conditions and interpretations governing our business and that of our tenants in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time potentially with retroactive effect this includes changes in tax laws spectrum use terms administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof for example the october 2019 indian supreme court ruling regarding the definition of agr and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations 

under agreements with us changes in laws regulations and judicial decisions could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our returns could be adversely affected 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests 

our expansion and innovation initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention achieving the benefits of acquisition and innovation activities depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences conflicting policies procedures and operations significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees integrating information technology systems acquiring permits and visiting inspecting engineering and upgrading tower sites or related communications infrastructure assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid some of our acquired tower portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications including sites that may be overburdened in these cases in addition to additional capital expenditures general liability risks associated with such towers will exist until such time as those towers are upgraded or otherwise remedied in addition integration may significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described above 

as a result of acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if as a result of the factors noted above the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

our expansion and innovation initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies then tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business results of operations or financial condition conversely we may invest significant capital in technologies innovation projects or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants which could make the acquisition of highquality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives required purchases of our joint venture partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices the method in which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates the london interbank offered rate “libor” announced plans to phase out libor rates by the end of 2021 as contemplated the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be assured after 2021 and libor may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking while our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event libor is unavailable the elimination of libor could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition financial institutions may replace libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements the secured overnight financing rate however no consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere furthermore the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs including increased interest expense and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future we cannot predict the effect of the fca’s decision not to sustain libor or if changes ultimately are made to libor the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 



 we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of reits for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

furthermore we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary reits which must also comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then the subsidiary reit would be subject to federal income tax which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest in addition our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and no more than 25 of the value of the assets of the reit may be represented by nonqualifying assets including securities of one or more trss this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers fiber networks data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as hurricanes ice and wind storms tornadoes floods earthquakes and wildfires as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism during the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change climate change or efforts to regulate emissions may also have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of emission compliance or fuel we need to deliver primary power to our tenants under our contractual obligations typically through dieselpowered generators in emerging markets further any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as part of our normal business activities and in our innovation or managed networks businesses we rely on information technology and other computing resources our computer systems network operation centers or power systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our 

operations including our ability to correctly record process and report financial information our tenants’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords or tenant information on our innovation or managed networks businesses which could result in a loss of revenue damage our reputation litigation penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues in addition our recent acquisitions including acquisitions of fiber businesses may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters business interruption and cybersecurity we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers fiber networks or data centers but for the event or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination 

we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements 

the requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs fines or penalties 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating leases further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to do so if we do not exercise these purchase rights and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers if we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

as of december 31 2019  we owned and operated a portfolio of 179520 communications sites including 1774 das networks see the table in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites in addition we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators in the united states which are included in our us property segment 

our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities 

a typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and in some cases one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment in addition many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets the principal types of our towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole and rooftop towers in our international markets 

 us property segment encumbered sites  as of december 31 2019  the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in march 2013 and march 2018 the “2013 securitization” and the “2018 securitization” respectively and together the “trust securitizations” is secured by mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers the “trust sites” and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in may 2015 the “2015 securitization” are secured by mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3542 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer the “2015 secured sites” 

asia property segment encumbered sites there are no encumbered sites in our asia property segment 

africa property segment encumbered sites our outstanding indebtedness in south africa is secured by an aggregate of 1899 towers 

europe property segment encumbered sites there are no encumbered sites in our europe property segment 

latin america property segment encumbered sites  our outstanding indebtedness in brazil is secured by an aggregate of 760 towers and outstanding indebtedness in colombia is secured by an aggregate of 3563 towers 

ground leases of the 177746 towers in our portfolio as of december 31 2019  approximately 90 were located on land we lease typically we seek to enter longterm ground leases which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods as a result 43 of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2029 and beyond 

tenants  our tenants are primarily wireless service providers broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries for the year ended december 31 2019  our top four tenants by total revenue were att  22  verizon wireless  15  tmobile  10  and sprint  8  across most of our markets our tenant leases generally have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms as a result approximately 65 of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2025 or beyond 

offices our principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in boston massachusetts where we currently lease approximately 40000 square feet of office space we also own or have entered into longterm leases for the majority of our facilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses including offices in each of our us asia africa europe and latin america segments we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of recent acquisitions including the eaton towers acquisition and changes to our organizational structure we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our emea segment into two separate segments africa property and europe property we now report our results in six segments – us property asia property africa property europe property latin america property and services we believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments and better aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the change in reportable segments has no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any periods historical financial information included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 and includes our us property asia property africa property europe property and latin america property segments 

we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites that we owned or operated as of december 31 2019  

  

 

 in most of our markets our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2019 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2019  we expect to generate nearly 469 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically based on an annual fixed escalation averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the nonrenewal of leases or rent renegotiations which we refer to as churn has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations 

during the year ended december 31 2019  churn was approximately 6 of our tenant billings the higher than historical level of churn was largely due to carrier consolidation events in india 

beginning in late 2017 we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or nonrenewals primarily due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in india which compressed our gross margin and operating profit particularly in our asia property segment although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites 

we anticipate that our churn rate in india will move closer to historical levels over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue gross margin and operating profit in the immediate term we expect that our churn rate will remain elevated primarily due the uncertainty created by the recent court ruling by the indian supreme court as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under under the captions “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “risk factors—our business and that of our tenants is subject to laws regulations and administrative and judicial decisions and changes thereto that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape” we expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our indian assets which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges for more information please see the information under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

for the year ended december 31 2019  aggregate carrier consolidation in india negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by 3613 million including approximately 842 million in passthrough revenue and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by 2477 million 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are 

 we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions according to industry data recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged approximately 300 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets we believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will over the long term position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as burkina faso ghana india kenya niger nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services predominantly on feature phones while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in india the ongoing transition from 2g technology to 4g technology has included a period of carrier consolidation whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace which we believe is now substantially complete we believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that is expected to be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are increasingly focused on 4g network build outs with certain continuing legacy investments in 3g consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and france carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 138545 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the captions “risk factors—if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results” further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2019  we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 13705 sites globally in a majority of our asia africa europe and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 



property operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated adjusted funds from operations “consolidated affo” and affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss from equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interests in this section we refer to nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “nareit ffo common stockholders” 

we define consolidated affo as nareit ffo common stockholders before i straightline revenue and expense ii stockbased compensation expense iii the deferred portion of income tax iv nonreal estate related depreciation amortization and accretion v amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and longterm deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interests less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures 

we define affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as consolidated affo excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both nareit ffo common stockholders and the other adjustments included in the calculation of consolidated affo in this section we refer to affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “affo common stockholders” 

adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap none of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo or affo common stockholders represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance 2 adjusted ebitda is a component underlying our credit ratings 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 consolidated affo is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust nareit ffo common stockholders for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in nareit ffo common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods 5 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 6 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies particularly those in our industry 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders may not however be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies reconciliations of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure have been included below

depreciation amortization and accretion 



the decrease in depreciation amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily attributable to the accelerated amortization of a tenant relationship intangible asset as a result of the settlement with tata in 2018 this decrease was partially offset by an increase resulting from the acquisition lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prioryear period which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 

the increase in depreciation amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily attributable to 3275 million of accelerated amortization of a tenant relationship intangible asset as a result of the settlement with tata also contributing to the increase was the acquisition lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prioryear period which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 

other operating expenses 



the decrease in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily attributable to decreases in impairment charges of 2998 million and losses on sales or disposals of assets of 405 million 

the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of 1826 million and an increase of 528 million in losses on sales or disposals of assets the impairment charges included 2583 million related to tower and network intangible assets and 1073 million related to tenant relationships in our asia property segment due to the settlement with tata aircel ltd’s “aircel” filing for bankruptcy protection and other carrier consolidationdriven churn in india the increase was also attributable to the nonrecurrence of a 222 million refund of acquisition costs recorded in the prioryear period related to an acquisition in brazil partially offset by 100 million to fund our charitable foundation in the 2017 

  

total other expense 



total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses we record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the increase in total other expense during the year ended december 31 2019 was due to i a decrease in other income of 168 million primarily due to the nonrecurrence of a gain of 97 million associated with the writeoffs of the capital lease liability and economic rights agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with tv azteca during the year ended december 31 2018 and ii an increase in loss on retirement of longterm obligations of 189 million primarily due to a loss of 221 million attributable to the repayment of the 5050 senior unsecured notes due 2020 the “5050 notes” these items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of 61 million in the current period compared to foreign currency losses of 45 million in the prioryear period and a decrease in net interest expense of 34 million 

the increase in total other expense during the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to additional interest expense of 759 million due to a 20 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of 45 million in the current period compared to foreign currency gains of 264 million in the prioryear period the increase was partially offset by i a decrease in loss on retirement of longterm obligations of 669 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of 702 million recorded in the prioryear period attributable to the redemptions of the 725 senior unsecured notes due 2019 and the 4500 senior unsecured notes due 2018 and the repayment of the secured cellular site revenue notes series 20122 class a series 20122 class b and series 20122 class c and secured cellular site revenue notes series 20102 class c and series 20102 class f ii an increase in other income of 234 million partially due to the writeoffs of the capital lease liability and economic rights agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with tv azteca and iii an additional 193 million in interest income compared to the prioryear period 

income tax benefit provision 



as a reit we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our reit operations in addition we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our nols subject to specified limitations consequently the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate 

the decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period offset by a 1130 million benefit arising from revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in india the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2018 was favorably impacted by certain events in india and a onetime benefit discussed below 

the change in the income tax benefit provision for the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period primarily resulting from impairment charges and accelerated amortization in india and a onetime benefit of 857 million related to the restructuring of international operations 

in certain jurisdictions the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2017 was favorably impacted by a clarification in income tax law in ghana

under each program we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors with respect to open market purchases we may use plans adopted in accordance with rule 10b51 under the exchange act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods these programs may be discontinued at any time 

we expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining 21 billion under the buyback programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors we expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities purchases under the buyback programs are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases

contractual obligations —the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 in millions 



 



debt entered into by our kenyan subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of sites in kenya the “kenya debt” which is required to be paid either i in future installments subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions or ii three years from the note origination date us subsidiary debt related to a sellerfinanced acquisition the “us subsidiary debt” and debt entered into by certain eaton towers subsidiaries acquired in connection with the eaton towers acquisition the “eaton towers debt” which is denominated in us dollar “usd” eur kenyan shilling “kes” and west african cfa franc subsequent to december 31 2019 we repaid all of the outstanding eaton towers usd denominated and kes denominated debt 

 offbalance sheet arrangements —we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

internally generated funds —because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2019 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities —the loan agreements for the 2019 multicurrency credit facility the 2019 credit facility the 2019 term loan and the 2020 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 



 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our debt levels 

4 effectively however additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand 

to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations— the indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the american tower secured revenue notes series 20151 class a the “series 20151 notes” and the american tower secured revenue notes series 20152 class a the “series 20152 notes” and together with the series 20151 notes the “2015 notes” issued by gtp acquisition partners i llc “gtp acquisition partners” in the 2015 securitization and the loan agreement related to trust securitizations as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things gtp acquisition partners and american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc together the “amt asset subs” are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreement 

under the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan made by the american tower trust i the “trust” to the amt asset subs the “loan” as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable which can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2019  631 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations is set forth below the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination 



 



 a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions and meet reit distribution requirements during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of the loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the 2015 notes upon the occurrence and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3542 communications sites that secure the 2015 notes or the 5114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the loan respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2019  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 



we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

in october 2019 the indian supreme court issued a ruling regarding the definition of agr and associated fees and charges that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us we will continue to monitor the status of these developments as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in india could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets including amounts originally recorded as tenantrelated intangibles the carrying value of tenantrelated intangibles in india was 11244 million as of december 31 2019  which represents 12 of our consolidated balance of 89995 million  additionally a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in india could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles the carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in india were 10648 million and 4834 million respectively as of december 31 2019 which represent 13 and 15 of our consolidated balances of 79641 million and 32304 million  respectively 

 goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

during the year ended december 31 2019  no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount the fair value of our india reporting unit which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows the income approach exceeded the carrying value by approximately 7 key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins capital expenditures terminal period growth rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation each of which could be impacted by our tenants’ ability to perform their contractual obligations as a result of the agr ruling or otherwise for this reporting unit we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a i less than 1 reduction of projected revenues ii 42 basis point increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital or iii 17 reduction in terminal sales growth rate individually each of which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the india reporting unit exceeds its carrying value events that could negatively affect our india reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” the carrying value of goodwill in the india reporting unit was 10218 million as of december 31 2019  which represents 17 of our consolidated balance of 61783 million  



costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date 

we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 662 million during the year ended december 31 2019  the change in 2019 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 our revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease arrangements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straightline calculation total property straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were 1835 million  876 million and 1944 million  respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met 

we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry with 54 of our revenues derived from four tenants in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated 

losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 effective january 1 2019 we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date the new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a rightofuse lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases the rightofuse asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability prepaid or accrued lease payments any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts 

the calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation the duration and the present value of the lease liability when calculating the lease term we consider the renewal cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor we determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term 

 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit

communications sites  approximately 96 97 and 95 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive additional passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended december 31 2018  

 

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests fiber and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites lease fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites the balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items 

 

services operations 

we offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 2  1 and 1 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis  we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

as the use of wireless services on handsets tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to capture this demand our primary operational focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and efficiency including through innovation initiatives and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for new uses and those that increase our operational efficiency 



we believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio 

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies 

 

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 

 

regulatory matters 

towers antennas and fiber  our us and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 52  of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance 

with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration permitting and public listings in india each of our operating subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war additionally in 2018 atc telecom infrastructure private limited “atc tipl” issued nonconvertible debentures which are listed on the national stock exchange of india although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation atc tipl is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca in uganda our subsidiary holds a public infrastructure service license issued by the uganda communications commission “ucc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and das networks for communication service providers licensed by the ucc in nigeria our subsidiary holds a license for infrastructure sharing and collocation services issued by the nigerian communications authority “ncc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the ncc in kenya our subsidiary holds a “network facilities provider license” issued by the communications authority of kenya “ca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services 

in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile comunicaciones y consumos sa holds a telecom license for a number of services it provides and is regulated by the ente nacional de comunicaciones enacom in argentina in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in kenya the ca requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 20 of their shares to kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in 

certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

in mexico our subsidiaries that hold our fiber business are regulated by the federal institute of telecommunications as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services 

environmental matters  our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and in other countries where we operate before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety  in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project

risk factors 

tableend

a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

 increasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space pricing competition from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our income could be adversely   affected 

if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases with us or related payments in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum 

we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed for example see our discussion of carrier consolidationdriven churn in our asia segment in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” in addition extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant 

our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape 

our business and those of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers at significant cost zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing or new regulatory policies zoning regulations or construction laws may materially and adversely affect the timing cost or completion of construction projects associated with our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants or result in decreased revenue due to removal of towers to ensure compliance in addition in certain jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time potentially with retroactive effect this includes changes in tax laws administrative guidance or judicial interpretations thereof in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 



we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under their agreements with us our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants a material modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty file for bankruptcy or terminate operations in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our tenants experiences financial difficulties or files for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset tenantrelated intangible asset or goodwill the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences and conflicting policies procedures and operations significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees acquiring permits and visiting inspecting engineering and upgrading tower sites could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid some of our acquired tower portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications including sites that may be overburdened in these cases in addition to additional capital expenditures general liability risks associated with such towers will exist until such time as those towers are upgraded or otherwise remedied in addition integration may 

significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described above 

as a result of acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if as a result of the factors noted above the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition conversely we may invest significant capital in technologies innovation projects or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 



 

we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives required purchases of our joint venture partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants in addition potential changes to or the elimination of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may adversely affect interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities certain other debt service obligations and interest rate swaps which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow us federal rules and some may not follow them at all for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

our domestic trs assets and operations are subject as applicable to federal and state corporation income taxes our foreign operations whether in the reit or trss are subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced 

furthermore we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary reits when we own interests in a subsidiary reit we must demonstrate that such subsidiary reit complies with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then the subsidiary reit would be 

subject to federal income tax which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest in addition our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in the united states and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets we enter into hedges for certain debt instruments these hedges may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our towers fiber networks data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters security breaches and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers and fiber networks are subject to risks associated with natural disasters including those that may be related to climate change such as hurricanes ice and wind storms tornadoes floods earthquakes and wildfires as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers or data centers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as part of our normal business activities we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational reporting and compliance activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems network operation centers or power systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyber attack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations including our ability to correctly record process and report financial information our tenants’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords which could result in a loss of revenue damage our reputation litigation penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues in addition our recent acquisitions including acquisitions of fiber businesses may increase our exposure to the risks described above and have material and adverse effects on our business 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters business interruption and cybersecurity we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers or fiber networks but for the event or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements 

the requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs fines or penalties 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating leases further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to do so if we do not exercise these purchase rights and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers if we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 in addition to the principal offices set forth above we maintain offices in the geographic areas we serve through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs 

as of december 31 2018  we owned and operated a portfolio of 170686  communications sites including 1701 das networks see the table in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial 

condition and results of operations—executive overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites in addition we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators in the united states which are included in our us property segment 

our interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities 

a typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment in addition many of our international sites typically include backup or auxiliary power generators and batteries the principal types of our towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole and rooftops in our international markets

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

we report our results in five segments us property asia property emea property latin america property and services in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 98  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  and includes our us property segment asia property segment emea property segment and latin america property segment 

we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites that we owned or operated as of december 31 2018  

  



 

 

in most of our markets our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have an initial noncancellable term of at least ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2018  was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2018  we expect to generate nearly 35 billion  of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically based on an annual fixed escalation averaging approximately 3  in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations or the nonrenewal of leases or rent renegotiations which we refer to as churn historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations this was again the case during the year ended december 31 2018  in which loss of tenant billings from tenant lease cancellations nonrenewal or renegotiations represented approximately 4 of our tenant billings 

in 2018 we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or nonrenewals primarily due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in india which we expect will continue to result in a higher impact on our revenues including tenant billings as compared to the historical average in 2019 we also expect this churn will compress our gross margin and operating profit in 2019 particularly in our asia property segment although we expect this to be partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites or the decommissioning of sites in addition we expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our indian assets which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges for more information please see the information under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” 

in october 2018 we entered into agreements with one of our tenants in india tata teleservices and related entities collectively “tata” for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of tata 

for the year ended december 31 2018 carrier consolidationdriven churn in india including churn associated with our settlement with tata negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by 1891 million including approximately 610 million in passthrough revenue and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by 1198 million 

the effects of carrier consolidationdriven churn described above were offset by the impact of the settlement with tata which resulted in a net positive impact to property revenue of 3337 million as a result of the 3455 million  cash payment partially offset by the impact of straightline accounting and other amounts directly related to the settlement the settlement also resulted in a net positive impact to operating profit of 3269 million 

on a net basis carrier consolidationdriven churn and our settlement with tata positively impacted our full year 2018 consolidated property revenue by 1446 million and our full year 2018 operating profit by 2071 million in 2019 we expect carrier consolidationdriven churn in india excluding the impact of the nonrecurrence of onetime items related to the settlement with tata in 2018 to negatively impact our consolidated property revenue by approximately 1912 million including approximately 223 million in passthrough revenue and our operating profit by approximately 1480 million 

we also recorded impairment charges of 1642 million  as a result of the settlement with tata in october 2018 and 1474 million as a result of one of our tenants in india aircel ltd’s “aircel” filing for bankruptcy protection in february 2018 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are 

 

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers 

and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions according to industry data recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged approximately 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 

as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel telefónica sa and vodafone group plc among others we believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as ghana india kenya nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services predominantly on feature phones while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in india the ongoing transition from 2g technology to 4g technology has included a period of carrier consolidation which we expect to continue through 2019 whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace over the long term this consolidation process is expected to result in a more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carriers as well as communications infrastructure providers in the shorter term as described above the consolidation process continues to result in elevated levels of churn within our india business as merging carriers rationalize redundant legacy equipment installations and as select carriers exit the marketplace 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and france carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 129930  communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results” further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2018  we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 24465  sites globally as well as the acquisition of certain urban telecommunications assets in brazil in a majority of our asia emea and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

  



property operations expenses  direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our 

profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated adjusted funds from operations “consolidated affo” and affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss from equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interests in this section we refer to nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “nareit ffo common stockholders” 

we define consolidated affo as nareit ffo common stockholders before i straightline revenue and expense ii stockbased compensation expense iii the deferred portion of income tax iv nonreal estate related depreciation amortization and accretion v amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and longterm deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interests less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures 

we define affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as consolidated affo excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both nareit ffo common stockholders and the other adjustments included in the calculation of consolidated affo in this section we refer to affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “affo common stockholders” 

adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap none of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo or affo common stockholders represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance 2 adjusted ebitda is a component underlying our credit ratings 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 consolidated affo is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust nareit ffo common stockholders for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in nareit ffo common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods 5 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 6 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies particularly those in our industry 

  

our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders may not however be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies reconciliations of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo common stockholders consolidated affo and affo common stockholders to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure have been included below

the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of 1826 million and an increase of 528 million in losses on sales or disposals of assets the impairment charges included 2583 million related to tower and network intangible assets and 1073 million related to tenant relationships in our asia property segment due to the settlement with tata aircel’s filing for bankruptcy protection and other carrier consolidationdriven churn in india the increase was also attributable to the nonrecurrence of a 222 million refund of acquisition costs recorded in the prioryear period related to an acquisition in brazil partially offset by 100 million to fund our charitable foundation in the prioryear period 

the increase in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of 1829 million these charges included 810 million related to tower and network intangible assets and 1001 million related to tenant relationships in our asia property segment primarily due to carrier consolidationdriven churn the increase in other operating expenses also included an increase of 77 million in losses on sales or disposals of assets and 100 million to fund our charitable foundation these items were partially offset by aggregate purchase price refunds of 222 million of acquisition costs primarily relating to an acquisition in brazil completed in 2014 

  

total other expense 



total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses we record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the increase in total other expense during the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily due to additional interest expense of 759 million due to a 20 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of 45 million  in the current period compared to foreign currency gains of 264 million in the prioryear period the increase was partially offset by i a decrease in loss on retirement of longterm obligations of 669 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of 702 million recorded in the prioryear period attributable to the redemptions of the 725 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the “725 notes” and the 4500 senior unsecured notes due 2018 the “4500 notes” and the repayment of the secured cellular site revenue notes series 20122 class a series 20122 class b and series 20122 class c and secured cellular site revenue notes series 20102 class c and series 20102 class f collectively the “gtp notes” ii an increase in other income of 234 million partially due to the writeoffs of the capital lease liability and economic rights agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with tv azteca as described in note 5 to our consolidated 

financial statements included in this annual report and iii an additional 193 million in interest income compared to the prioryear period

income tax benefit provision 

  



as a reit we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our reit operations in addition we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our nols subject to specified limitations consequently the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016 differs from the federal statutory rate 

the change in the income tax benefit provision for the year ended december 31 2018  was primarily attributable to the receipt of the payment associated with the tata settlement offset by the deferred tax benefit of impairment charges and accelerated amortization in india additionally we restructured our international operations in certain jurisdictions resulting in a currentyear benefit of 857 million which was offset by the nonrecurrence of prioryear benefit from a clarification in income tax law in ghana 

the decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2017 was primarily attributable to lower uncertain tax position reserve recorded in 2017 than in 2016 a decrease in foreign earnings in india due to impairments as well as changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions

contractual obligations  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  in millions 

  



 



   

offbalance sheet arrangements  we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

  

internally generated funds  because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2018  is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2013 credit facility the 2014 credit facility the 2013 term loan the 2018 term loan and the 2019 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade we must also maintain an interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the applicable loan agreement of at least 250100 as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 



 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our debt levels 

4 effectively however additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations  the indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the american tower secured revenue notes series 20151 class a the “series 20151 notes” and the american tower secured revenue notes series 20152 class a the “series 20152 notes” and together with the series 20151 notes the “2015 notes” issued by gtp acquisition partners i llc “gtp acquisition partners” in the 2015 securitization and the loan agreement related to the trust securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things gtp acquisition partners and the amt asset subs are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreement 

under the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable which can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2018  801 million  held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the trust securitizations is set forth below the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination 



 

 

a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions and meet reit distribution requirements during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of the loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the 2015 notes upon the occurrence and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3556 communications sites that secure the 2015 notes or the 5116  broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the loan respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2018  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

on february 28 2018 one of our tenants in asia aircel filed for bankruptcy protection we performed an impairment test based on current expectations of the impact of the bankruptcy on projected cash flows for assets related to aircel these assets consisted primarily of towers network location intangibles and tenantrelated intangibles as a result an impairment of 401 million was taken on the tower and network intangible assets we also fully impaired the tenantrelated intangible asset for aircel which resulted in an impairment of 1073 million during the year ended december 31 2018 

in october 2017 one of our tenants in asia tata teleservices informed the department of telecommunications in india of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider on october 23 2018 we entered into agreements with tata for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations effective november 1 2018 as part of the arrangement we received an upfront onetime inrdenominated cash payment equal to approximately 3455 million for the termination of lease obligations with tata teleservices in india in addition we entered into new leasing arrangements with a number of tataaffiliated entities as a result of the settlement and new leasing agreements we expect an approximately 80 reduction in revenues from tata as compared to what had previously been generated from the terminated leases in connection with the acceleration of the contractual arrangements we also accelerated the amortization of our tenant 

related intangible asset with tata teleservices which resulted in an additional amortization expense of 3275 million in 2018 we also recorded an impairment of 1642 million  for tower and network location intangible assets as a result of the settlement 

impairment of assets—goodwill  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 

goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

during the year ended december 31 2018  no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount the fair value of our india reporting unit which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows the income approach exceeded the carrying value by approximately 3111 million or 8 key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins capital expenditures terminal period growth rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation 

for this reporting unit we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a i 6 reduction of projected revenues ii 58 basis point increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital or iii 28 reduction in terminal sales growth rate individually each of which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the india reporting unit exceeds its carrying value events that could negatively affect our india reporting unit’s financial results include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” 

the carrying value of goodwill in the india reporting unit was 10455 million as of december 31 2018 which represents 19 of our consolidated balance of 55019 million 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 146 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  the change in 2018  primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 



evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition 

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry with 51  of our revenues derived from four tenants in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 effective january 1 2019 we will adopt the new lease accounting guidance which requires us to recognize a right of use “rou” lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases the rou asset will be measured as the sum of the lease liability prepaid or accrued lease payments any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts 

the calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation the duration and the present value of the lease liability when calculating the lease term we will consider the renewal cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor we will determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term 

 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management 

assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

the december 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” significantly changed how the us taxes corporations the tax act contains several key provisions including among other things a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of all post1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and the introduction of a new us tax on certain offshore earnings 

the sec staff issued guidance to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date we recognized the provisional impacts of the tax act in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 and finalized these amounts in 2018 with no significant changes to preliminary amounts

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and our joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 

since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and certain outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure fiber and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators 

in 2017 we launched operations in two new markets through our acquisitions of fps towers which owned or operated nearly 2500 wireless tower sites in france the “fps acquisition” and communications sites in paraguay from tigo paraguay we also acquired urban telecommunications assets in mexico including more than 50000 concrete poles and approximately 2100 route miles of fiber as of december 31 2017  our communications real estate portfolio of 150181  communications sites included 40618  communications sites in the us 58034  communications sites in asia 15611  communications sites in europe middle east and africa “emea” and 35918  communications sites in latin america as well as urban telecommunications assets in mexico argentina and south africa 

additionally in november 2017 we entered into definitive agreements with i idea cellular limited “idea” and ideas subsidiary idea cellular infrastructure services limited “icisl” a telecommunications company that owns and operates approximately 9900 communications sites in india to acquire 100 of the outstanding shares of icisl and ii vodafone india limited and vodafone mobile services limited together “vodafone” to acquire an aggregate of approximately 10235 communications sites from their telecommunications businesses in india subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval we expect these transactions to close in the first half of 2018 

we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes “reit” accordingly we generally are not subject to us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our reit income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their designation for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2017  our reit qualified businesses included our us tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica and mexico a majority of our operations in germany and a majority of our indoor das networks business and services segment as of january 1 2018 our operations in nigeria are also reit qualified 

we report our results in five segments – us property asia property emea property latin america property and services

products and services 

property operations 

our property operations accounted for 99  99 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed under longterm lease agreements with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 

our property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks the leasing of property interests the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 

communications sites  approximately 97 95 and 95 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive additional passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended december 31 2017  

 

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests fiber and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites lease fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites 

 

services operations 

we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 1  1 and 2 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis  we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

as the use of wireless services on handsets tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows and evolves there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to capture this demand our primary operational focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and efficiency including through innovation and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts to meet our tenants’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for additional uses and those that increase our operational efficiency 



operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade credit ratings we continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and as of december 31 2017  had 30 billion  of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio 

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria 

 

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 

 

recent transactions 

acquisitions 

we increased our communications site portfolio by 6887  sites in 2017 including 1960  buildtosuits we believe these assets will be an important component of our longterm growth in 2017  we launched operations in france through the fps 

acquisition additionally in 2017 we acquired an aggregate of 2453  communications sites in the united states brazil chile colombia germany mexico nigeria paraguay and peru and acquired urban telecommunications assets including concrete poles and fiber in mexico 

in november 2017 we entered into agreements with idea icisl and vodafone pursuant to which we expect to add an aggregate of approximately 20000 communications sites to our existing portfolio in india subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval we expect these transactions to close in the first half of 2018 

 we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business and generate returns that meet or exceed our criteria for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

financing transactions 

during 2017  to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio while maintaining our longterm financial policies we completed a number of key financing initiatives which among others included the following

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas  our us and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 55  of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration permitting and public listings in india each of our operating subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war additionally in 2018 atc telecom infrastructure private limited “atc tipl” issued nonconvertible debentures which are listed on the national stock exchange of india although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation atc tipl is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca in uganda our subsidiary holds a public infrastructure service license issued by the uganda communications commission “ucc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and das networks for communication service providers licensed by the ucc in nigeria our subsidiary holds a license for infrastructure sharing and collocation services issued by the nigerian communications authority “ncc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the ncc in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of 

site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile comunicaciones y consumos sa holds a telecom license for a number of services it provides and is regulated by the ente nacional de comunicaciones enacom in argentina in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies andor other forms of fees our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites for example there are pending tower marking regulations in the united states compliance with which may result in a substantial increase in our costs 

environmental matters  our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety  in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

our industry is highly competitive we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private 

equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

tenant demand 

our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our us and international markets while also investing in next generation data networks which will drive demand for our communications sites to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our services operations are complementary to our property business we believe demand for our services will continue consistent with industry trends 

 

as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—if our tenants consolidate their operations or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results” further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

 employees 

as of december 31 2017  we employed 4752 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

risk factors 

tableend

a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

 increasing competition within our industry for tenants may materially and adversely affect our revenue 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space pricing competition from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our income could be adversely   affected 

if our tenants consolidate their operations exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases with us or related payments in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum 

we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed in addition extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant 

our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers at significant cost zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in certain jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes in addition in certain jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time potentially with retroactive effect this includes potential or actual changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of tax authorities in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange 

rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under their agreements with us our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants a material modification of the terms of those leases a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty file for bankruptcy or terminate operations in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our tenants experiences financial difficulties or files for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset tenantrelated intangible asset or goodwill the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences and conflicting policies procedures and operations significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees and visiting and upgrading tower sites could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid in addition integration may significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the preceding risk factor 

as a result of acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if as a result of the factors noted above the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition conversely we may invest significant capital in technologies and innovation projects that may not provide expected returns or profitability which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 

we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

on december 22 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was signed into law the tax act makes significant changes to the code including a number of provisions that affect the taxation of reits of global corporations and of their stockholders among the changes made by the tax act are substantial changes to the taxation of international income we believe that certain consequences of some of these changes to reits with global operations were unintended nevertheless absent legislative or administrative relief with respect to these consequences we will recognize income on account of the activities of our foreign trss that will not be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests that we are required to satisfy or we may be subject to additional income tax or operational costs as a result thereof 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow us federal rules and some may not follow them at all for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

our domestic trs assets and operations are subject as applicable to federal and state corporation income taxes our foreign operations whether in the reit or trss are subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced 

furthermore we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary reits when we own interests in a subsidiary reit we must demonstrate that such subsidiary reit complies with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then the subsidiary reit would be subject to federal income tax which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest in addition our ownership of 

shares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 20 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in the united states and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets we enter into hedges for certain debt instruments these hedges may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resourcesfactors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our towers data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters including those that may be related to climate change such as hurricanes ice and wind storms tornadoes floods earthquakes and wild fires as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers or data centers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as part of our normal business activities we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational reporting and compliance activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems or network operation centers or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyber attack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters business interruption and cybersecurity we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites for a major future event lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements 

the requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs fines or penalties 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate 

that tower site and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating leases further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to do so if we do not exercise these purchase rights and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers if we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

we report our results in five segments us property asia property emea property latin america property and services in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 99  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  and includes our us property segment asia property segment emea property segment and latin america property segment 

we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites that we owned or operated as of december 31 2017  

  



 

 

in most of our markets our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of at least ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2017  was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2017  we expect to generate over 32 billion  of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods before the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically based on an annual fixed escalation averaging approximately 3  in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations or the nonrenewal of leases or rent renegotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations this was again the case during the year ended december 31 2017  in which loss of tenant billings from tenant lease cancellations nonrenewal or renegotiations represented approximately 2 of our tenant billings we do anticipate an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or nonrenewals in 2018 primarily due to carrier consolidationdriven churn in asia which is likely to result in a modestly higher impact on our revenues including tenant billings as compared to the historical average 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are 

 

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 



 

 

as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as bharti airtel limited telefónica sa and vodafone group plc among others we believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as ghana india nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services predominantly on feature phones while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in india the ongoing transition from 2g technology to 4g technology has included and is expected to continue to include a period of carrier consolidation over the next several years whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace will be reduced through mergers acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace over the long term this consolidation process is expected to result in a more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carriers as well as communications infrastructure providers in the shorter term the consolidation process has resulted and is likely to further result in elevated levels of churn within our india business as certain components of the combined carrier networks and carrier exits are decommissioned to allow for a more robust 4g deployment in the future 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices and as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and france carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 109565  communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2017  we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 6885  sites globally as well as the acquisition of certain urban telecommunications assets in mexico in a majority of our asia emea and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications 

real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

  



property operations expenses  direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues

total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses we record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the increase in total other expense during the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily due to a loss on retirement of longterm obligations of 702 million attributable to the redemptions of the 725 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the “725 notes” and the 4500 senior unsecured notes due 2018 the “4500 notes” and the repayment of the secured cellular site revenue notes series 20122 class a series 20122 class b and series 20122 class c and secured cellular site revenue notes series 20102 class c and series 20102 class f compared to the year ended december 31 2016 where we recorded a gain on retirement of longterm obligations of 12 million attributable to the repayment of the secured tower cellular site revenue notes series 20121 class a and the secured cellular site revenue notes series 20101 class c the increase was also attributable to additional interest expense of 325 million due to a 09 billion increase in our average debt outstanding these items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of 264 million compared to foreign currency losses of 489 million in the prioryear period as well an additional 98 million in interest income compared to the prioryear period

income tax provision 

  



as a reit we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our reit operations in addition we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our nols subject to specified limitations consequently the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015 differs from the federal statutory rate 

the decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily attributable to lower uncertain tax position reserve recorded in 2017 than in 2016 a decrease in foreign earnings in india due to impairments as well as changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions 

the decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2016 was primarily attributable to a tax election filed in 2015 pursuant to which mipt no longer operates as a separate reit for federal and state income tax purposes in connection with this and related elections we incurred a onetime cash tax charge of 930 million and a onetime deferred income tax benefit of 58 million for the year ended december 31 2015 these items were offset by a onetime increase in tax reserves for the year ended december 31 2016

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

o ur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

  

internally generated funds  because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2017  is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2013 credit facility the 2014 credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the applicable loan agreement of at least 250100 as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 



 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our debt levels 

4 effectively however additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization  the indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the american tower secured revenue notes series 20151 class a the “series 20151 notes” and the american tower secured revenue notes series 20152 class a the “series 20152 notes” and together with the series 20151 notes the “2015 notes” issued by gtp acquisition partners i llc “gtp acquisition partners” in the 2015 securitization and the loan agreement related to the 2013 securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc together the “amt asset subs” and gtp acquisition partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreement 

under the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 20132a issued in the 2013 securitization the “loan” as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable which can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2017  1073 million  held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization is set forth below the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination 



 



 

a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the 2015 notes upon the occurrence and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 2015 secured sites or the 2013 secured towers respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2017  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 



we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

in october 2017 one of our tenants in asia tata teleservices informed the department of telecommunications in india of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider 

we considered these recent developments regarding these events when conducting our annual impairment test for the tata teleservices tenant relationship which did not result in an impairment since the estimated probabilityweighted undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the carrying value of this asset by approximately 335 million or 7 

key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows were future revenue projections estimates of ongoing tenancies operating margins and the probability weightings assigned to the future cash flow scenarios for this tenant relationship intangible asset we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a 7 reduction on projected cash flows which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusion that the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the tenant relationship exceeds its carrying value 

we will continue to monitor the status of these developments as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tata teleservices could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets including amounts originally recorded as tenantrelated intangibles which have a current net book value of 4364 million 

 goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

during the year ended december 31 2017  no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount the fair value of our india reporting unit which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows the income approach exceeded the carrying value by approximately 991 million or 3 as a result of the telecommunications carrier consolidation occurring in the india market we lowered our discounted cash flow projections which increases the sensitivity of these projections to changes in the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the india reporting unit as of december 31 2017 key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins capital expenditures terminal period growth rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation 

for this reporting unit we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that i a 6 reduction on projected revenues ii a 21 basis point increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital or iii a 10 reduction in terminal sales growth rate individually each of which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the india reporting unit exceeds its carrying value events that could negatively affect our india reporting units financial results include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” 

the carrying value of goodwill in the india reporting unit was 10950 million as of december 31 2017 which represents 19 of our consolidated balance of 56384 million 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 683 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  the change in 2017  primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry with 53  of our revenues derived from four tenants in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and 

tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

the tax act significantly changes how the us taxes corporations the tax act contains several key provisions including among other things a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of all post1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and the introduction of a new us tax on certain offshore earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” 

the sec staff issued guidance to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date we have recognized the provisional impacts of the tax act in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 we estimated these amounts to not be material however our estimates are provisional and subject to further analysis 

the financial accounting standards board also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of gilti noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the permitted measurement period

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2017  44  of our revenues and 51  of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2017  we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being a longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in 902 million  of unrealized losses that would be included in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2017

overview 

we are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 99  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we refer to this business as our services operations 

our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our communications real estate portfolio of 144884  communications sites as of december 31 2016  included 40414  communications sites in the us 57945  communications sites in asia 12861  communications sites in europe middle east and africa “emea” and 33664  communications sites in latin america 

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 

since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in 2016 we significantly expanded our asia segment portfolio by acquiring a 51 controlling ownership interest in viom networks limited “viom” a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates approximately 42000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india the “viom acquisition” subsequent to the closing viom was renamed atc telecom infrastructure private limited “atc tipl” in 2016 we launched operations in argentina a new market for us in december 2016 our newly formed joint venture in europe entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a tower company in france which is also a new market for us this acquisition closed in february 2017 

we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes “reit” accordingly we generally are not subject to us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their designation for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2016  our reit qualified businesses included our us tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a majority of our services segment and indoor das networks business 

we report our results in five segments – us property formerly referred to as “domestic rental and management” asia property emea property latin america property asia property emea property and latin america property were formerly referred to as “international rental and management” and services formerly referred to as “network development services” 

for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

products and services 

property operations 

our property operations accounted for 99  98 and 98 of our total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 

our property business includes the operation of communications sites managed networks the leasing of property interests fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 

communications sites  approximately 95 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites for each of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive additional passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended december 31 2016  

 

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests fiber and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites lease fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites 

 

services operations 

we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 1  2 and 2 of our total revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis  we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new and broader opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for additional uses and those that increase our operational efficiency 

 

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for 

distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria 

 

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 

 

recent transactions 

acquisitions and joint venture 

we increased our communications site portfolio by 45309  sites in 2016 including 1869  buildtosuits we believe these assets will be an important component of our longterm growth in 2016  we completed the viom acquisition which included approximately 42000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india we also launched operations in argentina through the acquisition of comunicaciones y consumos sa “cycsa” which owned or operated urban telecommunications assets fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation in addition we acquired an aggregate of 891  communications sites in the united states brazil chile germany mexico nigeria and south africa in 2016 

in december 2016 we entered into a joint venture “atc europe” to which we contributed our german business in exchange for an investment from our partner pggm atc europe will focus on pursuing telecommunications real estate investment opportunities in select countries in europe in december 2016 atc europe entered into a definitive agreement to purchase fps towers “fps” which owns and operates approximately 2400 wireless tower sites in france this transaction closed on february 15 2017 

 we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business and generate returns that meet or exceed our criteria for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

financing transactions 

during 2016  to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio while maintaining our longterm financial policies we completed a number of key financing initiatives which among others included the following 

 

 

for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas  our us and international tower leasing business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 59  of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

certain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration and permitting in india each of our operating subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca in uganda our subsidiary holds a public infrastructure service license issued by the uganda communications commission “ucc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and das networks for communication service providers licensed by the ucc in nigeria our subsidiary holds a license for infrastructure sharing and collocation services issued by the nigerian communications authority “ncc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the ncc in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile cycsa holds a telecom license for a number of services it provides and is regulated by the ente nacional de comunicaciones enacom in argentina in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition 

certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites for example there are pending tower marking regulations in the united states compliance with which may result in a substantial increase in our costs 

environmental matters  our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety  in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

customer demand 

our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our us and international markets while also investing in next generation data networks which will drive demand for our communications sites to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our services operations are complementary to our property business we believe demand for our services will continue consistent with industry trends 

 

as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues” further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

 employees 

as of december 31 2016  we employed 4507 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

decrease in demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

 increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our income could be adversely   affected 

if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases with us or related payments in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed 

our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers at significant costs zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in certain jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes in addition in certain jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and apply retroactively furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the “base erosion profit shifting” or “beps” project initiated by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future exposes us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences and conflicting policies procedures and operations significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid for example the integration of viom into our operations is a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will continue to incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with that integration including costs associated with onboarding employees and visiting and upgrading tower sites in addition integration may significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the preceding risk factor 

as a result of acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue our failure to innovate in response to the development and 

implementation of these or similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 

we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants a material modification of the terms of those leases or a failure to obtain new business from existing tenants any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy 

in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experiences financial difficulties or files for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or tenantrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax reform proposals if enacted may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow us federal rules and some may not follow them at all for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

our domestic trs assets and operations are subject as applicable to federal and state corporation income taxes our foreign operations whether in the reit or trss are subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced 

furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc “mipt” we owned an interest in a subsidiary reit effective july 25 2015 we filed a tax election pursuant to which mipt no longer operates as a separate reit the statute of limitations is still open for certain years and mipt’s qualification as a reit could still be challenged as such for all open years we must demonstrate that the subsidiary reit complied with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify as a reit for any of the open years and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would have been subject to federal income tax for such year which tax we would inherit along with applicable penalties and interest ii the subsidiary reit would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the remaining taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost iii for those years in which the subsidiary reit failed to qualify as a reit our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would have failed to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may have failed certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit for those periods unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisions 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets effective january 1 2018 this limitation is reduced to 20 this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the 

businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in the united states and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities and the terms of our preferred stock could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resourcesfactors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the terms of our preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock a failure to pay dividends on both our preferred and our common stock might jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit they may prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income making us subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all 

information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating leases further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition while we maintain environmental insurance we may not have adequate insurance to cover all remediation costs fines or penalties 

our towers data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers or data centers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as part of our normal business activities we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational reporting and compliance activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyber attack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters business interruption and cybersecurity we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites for a major future event lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

we report our results in five segments us property asia property emea property latin america property and services in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 99  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  and includes our us property segment asia property segment emea property segment and latin america property segment 

we also offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites we owned or operated as of december 31 2016  

  



 

 

in general our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of at least ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2016  was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2016  we expect to generate over 31 billion  of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation averaging approximately 3  in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2016  loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2 of our property operations revenues 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are 

 

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives in our international markets certain passthrough revenue amounts may fluctuate with changing power and fuel costs 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 

as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel telefónica sa and vodafone group plc we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as ghana india nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services predominantly on feature phones while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices and as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and france carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 104470  communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn our master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2016  we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 45310  sites in a majority of our asia emea and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

  



property operations expenses  direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders consolidated adjusted funds from operations “consolidated affo” and affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss from equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interest in this section we refer to nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as “nareit ffo common stockholders”

total other expense 

  



total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses we record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the decrease in total other expense during the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily due to foreign currency losses of 489 million in the current period compared to foreign currency losses of 1347 million in the prioryear period and a gain on retirement of longterm obligations of 12 million in the current period attributable to the repayment of the secured cellular site revenue notes series 20121 class a and the secured cellular site revenue notes series 20101 class c compared to the year ended december 31 2015 where we recorded a loss of 796 million primarily due to the redemption of the 7000 senior notes due 2017 and 4625 senior notes due 2015 this decrease was partially offset by incremental interest expense of 1212 million due to an increase of 21 billion in our average debt outstanding and an increase in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 367 to 392 

the increase in total other expense during the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to foreign currency losses of 1347 million in the year ended december 31 2015 compared to foreign currency losses of 632 million in the prioryear period and a loss on retirement of longterm obligations of 796 million during the year ended december 31 2015 primarily due to the redemption of the 7000 senior notes due 2017 and 4625 senior notes due 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 where we recorded a loss of 35 million the increase in total other expense was also attributable to incremental interest expense of 157 million due to an increase of 19 billion in our average debt outstanding partially offset by a decrease in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 406 to 367 

income tax provision 

  



as a reit we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our reit operations in addition we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our nols subject to specified limitations consequently the effective tax rate “etr” on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014 differs from the federal statutory rate 

the decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily attributable to the nonrecurrence of the onetime charge related to the mipt tax election described below offset by an increase in 2016 foreign taxable earnings largely due to the viom acquisition as well as uncertain tax positions 

effective july 25 2015 we filed a tax election pursuant to which mipt no longer operates as a separate reit for federal and state income tax purposes in connection with this and related elections we incurred a onetime cash tax charge of 930 million and a onetime deferred income tax benefit of 58 million in the year ended december 31 2015 we also recorded a charge of 131 million resulting from a change in income tax law in ghana these items caused an increase in the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2015

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

o ur liquidity depends upon our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

  

internally generated funds  because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2016  is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility the 2013 credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the applicable loan agreement of at least 250100 as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 



 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our debt levels 

4 effectively however the capacity under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization  the indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the american tower secured revenue notes series 20151 class a the “series 20151 notes” and the american tower secured revenue notes series 20152 class a the “series 20152 notes” and together with the series 20151 notes the “2015 notes” issued by gtp acquisition partners i llc “gtp acquisition partners” in the 2015 securitization and the loan agreement related to the 2013 securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc together the “amt asset subs” and gtp acquisition partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreement 

under the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 20132a issued in the 2013 securitization the “loan” as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable and can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2016  995 million  held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization is set forth below  in millions the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination 



 

 

a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the 2015 notes upon the occurrence and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 2015 secured sites or the 2013 secured towers respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital for these purposes we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2016  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

 goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

during the year ended december 31 2016  no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount 



costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date 

we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 141 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  the change in 2016  primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and 56  of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 



 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states

 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2016  consisted of 13850 million  under the 2014 credit facility 5400 million  under the 2013 credit facility 10000 million  under the term loan 6000 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2250 notes 847 million  under the south african credit facility 283 million under the colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements 1010 million  under the br towers debentures and 453 million  under the brazil credit facility a 10 increase in current interest rates would result in an additional 100 million  of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported 

in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2016  40  of our revenues and 45  of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2016  we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being a longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in 380 million  of unrealized losses that would be included in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2016

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in 2015 we significantly expanded our portfolio by i obtaining the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage 11449 wireless communications sites from verizon communications inc “verizon” in the united states the “verizon transaction” and ii acquiring 4716 communications sites in nigeria from certain subsidiaries of bharti airtel limited “airtel” in addition in october 2015 we signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which we expect to acquire a 51 controlling ownership interest in viom networks limited “viom” a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over 42000  wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 

we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes “reit” accordingly we generally are not subject to us federal income taxes on income generated by our us reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their designation for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2015  our us reit qualified businesses included our us tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a majority of our services segment and indoor das networks business 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of recent investment activity including signed acquisitions we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our international segment into regional segments we now operate in five reportable segments us property asia property emea property latin america property and services we believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments as they continue to grow and corresponds with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources managing the growth and profitability of the business and assessing our operating performance 

for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

products and services 

property operations 

our property operations accounted for 98  of our total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 

our property business includes the operation of communications sites managed networks the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of total revenue for the years ended december 31 

communications sites  approximately 95 95 and 96 of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications our top tenants by revenue are as follows for the year ended december 31 2015  

 

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites 

 

services operations 

we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 2  of our total revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis  we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure 

 

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt as necessary consistent with our longterm financial policies

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among others 

 

recent transactions 

acquisitions 

we increased our communications site portfolio by 25368  sites in 2015 including 3235  buildtosuits we believe these assets will be an important component of our longterm growth significant transactions in 2015  included the verizon transaction the acquisition of 5483 communications sites in brazil from tim celular sa “tim” and the acquisition of 4716 communications sites in nigeria from certain subsidiaries of airtel in addition in october 2015 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 51 controlling ownership interest in viom 

we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business and generate returns that meet or exceed our criteria for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

financing transactions 

during 2015  to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio while maintaining our longterm financial policies we completed a number of key financing initiatives which among others included the following

for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and notes 8 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas  our us and international tower leasing business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 67  of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

in india each of our operating subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi “ipi” registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca in uganda our subsidiary holds a public infrastructure service license issued by the uganda communications commission “ucc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and das networks for communication service providers licensed by the ucc in nigeria our subsidiary holds a license for infrastructure sharing and collocation services issued by the nigerian communications authority “ncc” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the ncc in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

environmental matters  our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety  in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and gtl infrastructure limited wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

customer demand 

our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our us and international markets driving demand for our communications sites 

 

as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our services operations are complementary to our property business we believe demand for our services will continue consistent with industry trends 

demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption “risk factors—new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues” further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

 employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed 3371 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

risk factors 

tableend

decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent demand for our services could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand include 

 if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed 

increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter new leases it may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our income could be adversely   affected 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition for assets which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing regulatory policies may materially 

and adversely affect the timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in certain jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes in addition in certain jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and apply retroactively furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions that we operate may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the “base erosion profit shifting” or “beps” project initiated by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a reit as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us including our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 

we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities assets sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

  

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integration of acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences and conflicting policies procedures and operations significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid in addition integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel for example the integration of the verizon assets into our operations is a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will continue to incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with that integration including costs for tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verifications if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired 

portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the risk factor immediately below 

as a result of prior acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future exposes us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow 

commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply 

qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax reform proposals if enacted may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits of remaining so qualified there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 12 

 we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow us federal rules and some may not follow them at all for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit’s deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

our domestic trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporation income taxes our foreign operations whether in the reit or trss will continue to be subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced 

furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc “mipt” we owned an interest in a subsidiary reit effective july 25 2015 we filed a tax election pursuant to which mipt no longer operates as a separate reit the statute of limitations is still open for certain years and mipt’s qualification as a reit could still be challenged as such for all open years we must demonstrate that the subsidiary reit complied with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify as a reit for any of the open years and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would have been subject to federal income tax for such year which tax we would inherit along with applicable penalties and interest ii the subsidiary reit would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the remaining taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost iii for those years in which the subsidiary reit failed to qualify as a reit our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would have failed to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may have failed certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit for those periods unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisions 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets effective january 1 2018 this limitation is reduced to 20 this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in us and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate tower sites and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating leases further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities and the terms of our preferred stock could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resourcesfactors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

the terms of our preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock a 

failure to pay dividends on both our preferred and our common stock might jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit they may prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income making us subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities including generators we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our towers data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism any damage or destruction to or inability to access our towers or data centers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as part of our normal business activities we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational reporting and compliance activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyber attack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event we carry business interruption insurance but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event further we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” below 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of recent investment activity including signed acquisitions we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our international segment into regional segments we now operate in five reportable segments us property asia property emea property latin america property and services in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management uses among other factors segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

executive overview 

we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 98  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  and includes our us property segment asia property segment emea property segment and latin america property segment 

we also offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites we owned or operated as of december 31 2015  

  



 

   

on october 21 2015 we signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which we expect to acquire a 51 controlling ownership interest in viom a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over 42000  wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india upon closing we expect to consolidate the full financial results for viom 

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of at least ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2015  was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2015  we expect to generate over 30 billion  of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation approximately 3  in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2015  loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2  of our property operations revenues 

property operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting 

regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are 

 

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives in a majority of our international markets revenue also often includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

property operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions 

based on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 

as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over 

the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel telefónica sa and vodafone group plc we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward 

in emerging markets such as ghana india nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services predominantly on feature phones while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on 3g network build outs with select investments in 4g technology consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices and as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 60190  communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable long  term growth 

we have holistic master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

property operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2015  we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 25370  sites in a majority of our asia emea and latin america markets the acquisition or construction of new sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

  



property operations expenses  direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our property segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment 

selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our property operations we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” and adjusted funds from operations “affo” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interest 

we define affo as nareit ffo before i straightline revenue and expense ii stockbased compensation expense iii the noncash portion of our tax provision iv nonreal estate related depreciation amortization and accretion v amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and longterm deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interest less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures 

we present affo for the year ended december 31 2015 before the onetime cash charge incurred in connection with a tax election pursuant to which one of our subsidiaries no longer operates as a separate reit as it is nonrecurring and we do not believe it is an indication of our operating performance 

adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap neither nareit ffo nor affo represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 5 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo may not however be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies reconciliations of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure have been included below

selling general administrative and development expense 

  



 

 

year ended december 31 2015   

the increases in our us asia and emea property segments’ selling general administrative and development expense “sga” were primarily driven by increasing personnel costs to support our business including additional costs associated with transactions such as the verizon transaction in our us property segment and the airtel acquisition in our emea property segment the emea property sga increase included an increase in bad debt expense and was partially offset by a decrease attributable to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations 

the decrease in our latin america property segment sga was primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by increased personnel costs to support the growth of our business and an increase in bad debt expense 

the increase in services segment sga was primarily due to increased personnel costs 

the increase in other sga was due to an increase in corporate sga of 167 million and an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 102 million corporate sga reflects an increase in legal costs as corporate sga during the year ended december 31 2014 was favorably impacted by the recovery of legal expenses in addition during the year ended december 31 2015 corporate sga increased due to an increase in personnel costs to support our business 

year ended december 31 2014   

the increases in our property segments’ sga were primarily driven by increasing personnel costs to support our business including additional costs associated with our acquisitions such as mipt in our us property segment us property segment sga also included an increase of 110 million associated with project cancellation costs the asia emea and latin america property segment sga increases were partially offset by decreases attributable to impacts of foreign currency fluctuations in each of our latin america and emea property segments the increase was partially offset by the reversal of bad debt expense for amounts previously reserved 

the increase in services segment sga was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to the additional site acquisition zoning and permitting services associated with certain tenants’ next generation technology network upgrade projects including an increase in volume as a result of the additional sites acquired as part of the acquisition of mipt 

the decrease in other sga was primarily due to a decrease in corporate sga of 155 million which was partially offset by an increase of 117 million related to stockbased compensation expense the decrease in corporate sga was primarily related to a reduction in legal expenses of 225 million including the recovery of expenses during the year ended december 31 2014  and the reversal of a 28 million reserve associated with a nonrecurring state tax item the decrease in corporate sga was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs to support our business

 44 

 offbalance sheet arrangements  we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

o ur liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

  

internally generated funds  because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2015  is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

         restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities  the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility the 2013 credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the applicable loan agreement of at least 250100 as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with each of these covenants 



 

1 each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 

2 assumes no change to adjusted ebitda 

3 assumes no change to our existing debt levels 

 5 effectively however the capacity under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization  the 2015 indenture and the loan agreement related to the 2013 securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc together the “amt asset subs” and gtp acquisition partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the applicable agreement 

under the terms of the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 20132a issued in the 2013 securitization the “loan” as applicable which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement subject to the conditions described in the table below the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs as applicable which can then be distributed to and used by us as of december 31 2015  1113 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash 

certain information with respect to each of the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization is set forth below  in millions the debt service coverage ratio “dscr” is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the applicable agreement to the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination

a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments during an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the dscr was equal to or below the cash trap dscr would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan as applicable on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement with respect to the 2015 notes upon occurrence and during an event of default the applicable trustee may in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes furthermore if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3609  2015 secured sites or the 5186  2013 secured towers respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to repay or repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2015  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 47 

we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

 goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

during the year ended december 31 2015  no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 62 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  the change in 2015  primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 48 

replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition 

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and 63 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states

interest rate risk 

we have one interest rate swap agreement in colombia as of december 31 2015 the interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge has a notional amount of 302 million  an interest rate of 574  and expires in april 2021 

 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2015  was comprised of 19800 million  under the 2014 credit facility 12250 million  under the 2013 credit facility 20000 million under the term loan 752 million  under the uganda loan 537 million under the south african facility 302 million  under the colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreement 852 million  under the br towers debentures and 219 million  under the brazil credit facility a 10 increase in current interest rates would result in an additional 108 million  of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2015  

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of aoci we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2015  32 of our revenues and 36 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

as of december 31 2015  we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being a longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances 

would result in 717 million of unrealized losses that would be included in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2015

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a global independent owner operator and developer of communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 through our network development services business we offer towerrelated services domestically which primarily support our site leasing business 

our communications real estate portfolio of 75594 communications sites as of december 31 2014 includes 28566 communications towers domestically 46598 communications towers internationally and 430 distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators 

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures 

on february 5 2015 we signed a definitive agreement with verizon communications inc “verizon” pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites for 5056 billion in cash at closing the “proposed verizon transaction” subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments 

we operate as a reit and therefore are generally not subject to us federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing space on our towers however even as a reit we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition our international assets and operations including those designated as direct or indirect qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities of a reit collectively “qrss” continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be treated as qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss during the year ended december 31 2014 we restructured certain of our german subsidiaries and certain of our domestic trss which included a portion of our network development services segment and indoor das networks business to be treated as qrss as a result as of december 31 2014 our qrss include our domestic tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a portion of our network development services segment and indoor das networks business

we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio mobile video and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows 

 

  

 accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites 

 

  

   

 network development services 

through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services network development services primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades this segment accounted for approximately 2 2 and 3 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure 

 

   

  

  

 capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt as necessary to reduce our net leverage to be within our longterm target range 

 

  

  

 during 2014 we generated 21 billion of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund 19 billion of investments including 10 billion of acquisitions and 9744 million of capital expenditures in addition in 2014 we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 4046 million to our common stockholders and approximately 160 million to our preferred stockholders 

international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be 

  

achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses 

 

  

  

 recent transactions 

acquisitions 

from january 1 2014 through december 31 2014 we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 8450 sites including approximately 3133 buildtosuits and we believe the assets constructed and acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins significant acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014 included the acquisition of i 100 of the equity interests of br towers sa a brazilian telecommunications real estate company “br towers” which at closing owned or held exclusive use rights for 4617 towers and 47 property interests in brazil and ii entities holding a portfolio of 59 communications sites which at the time of acquisition were leased primarily to radio and television broadcast tenants and four property interests in the united states from richland properties llc and other related entities “richland” 

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2014 we signed definitive agreements to acquire approximately 11280 additional communications sites in brazil and nigeria and in february 2015 we signed a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites in the united states 

we continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

financing transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2014 to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio we strengthened our balance sheet by completing a number of 

  

key financing initiatives including those set forth below for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

senior notes offerings in january 2014 we completed a registered public offering through a reopening of our i 340 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the “340 notes” in an aggregate principal amount of 2500 million and our ii 500 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the “500 notes” in an aggregate principal amount of 5000 million in august 2014 we completed a registered public offering of our 3450 senior unsecured notes due 2021 the “3450 notes” in an aggregate principal amount of 6500 million we used the net proceeds from each offering primarily to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities 

mandatory convertible preferred stock offering in may 2014 we completed a registered public offering of 6000000 shares of our 525 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a par value 001 per share the “mandatory convertible preferred stock” we used the net proceeds from the offering to fund acquisitions initially funded by indebtedness incurred under our 20 billion multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “2013 credit facility” 

credit facilities in september 2014 we entered into an amendment and restatement of our 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “2012 credit facility” as amended and restated the “2014 credit facility” which among other things increased the commitments thereunder to 15 billion and extended the maturity date to january 31 2020 as a result as of december 31 2014 we had the ability to borrow up to 24 billion under our existing credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 66 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license “ipi” issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” 

  

has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

environmental matters our domestic and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

  

competition 

we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure limited wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

customer demand 

our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites 

 

  

  

  

  

 as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends 

any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the provider’s license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

in addition our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we employed 2974 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed 

increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates 

  

we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter new leases it may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where the majority of our leases include fixed escalators our income would be adversely affected increasing competition for tenants or significant increases in inflation rates could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria 

we may experience increased competition which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply lower investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle an existing tower zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition furthermore some foreign jurisdictions have implemented regulations governing investment funds or their managers which may be interpreted to apply to reits and there is uncertainty as to the interpretation and implementation of these regulations 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us 

our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 

our leverage could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable and the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage 

failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired or leased assets including from the proposed verizon transaction the “verizon assets” into our operations may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

integrating acquired portfolios of communications sites may require significant resources as well as attention from our management team in addition we may incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with the integration of acquired or leased assets or businesses into our operations further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid for example the integration of the verizon assets which includes up to 11489 towers into our operations will be a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with the integration of the verizon assets into our operations including costs for tasks such as tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verifications additional integration challenges include 

 

  

  

  

  

 additionally we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity if we are not able to meet these integration challenges we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses including the proposed verizon transaction and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel 

furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the risk factor immediately below some of which may require additional resources and personnel 

in addition as a result of prior acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy 

in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise 

  

adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available 

effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply 

qualification as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax reform proposals if enacted may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit or the benefits of remaining so qualified there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

  

  

 any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some 

  

investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced 

furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc “mipt” we own an interest in a subsidiary reit the subsidiary reit is independently subject to and must comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax ii the subsidiary reit will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost iii our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we will fail to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisions 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing 

further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes any of these taxes decrease our earnings and our available cash 

  

we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities asset sales or equity issuances we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases and the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2024 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such 

  

towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit they may prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income making us subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts 

further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

further the terms of our preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock a failure to pay dividends on both our preferred and our common stock might jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes for more information on the terms of our preferred stock see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health 

  

risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our towers data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events such as acts of terrorism any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers or certain unforeseen events may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants 

as part of our normal business activities we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyber attack and data theft usage errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control although we have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenue including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event if we are unable to provide services to our tenants it could lead to tenant loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

executive overview 

we are a global independent owner operator and developer of communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

  

the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites we owned or operated as of december 31 2014 

 

  

  on february 5 2015 we signed a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites in the united states for 5056 billion in cash at closing subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments 

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2014 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2014 we expect to generate approximately 27 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation approximately 30 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2014 loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented approximately 15 of our rental and management operations revenues 

rental and management operations revenue growth  due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant remaining tower capacity and 

  

tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased through tower augmentation 

the primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our domestic and international rental and management segments are 

 

  

  

  

 we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition consistent with our signing of a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and in new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives in a majority of our international markets revenue also includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs 

rental and management operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth 

 

 based on industry research and projections we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 

  

   

  

  

 we have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

 

 in emerging markets such as ghana india and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on third generation 3g network build outs and augmentations with select initial investments in fourth generation 4g technology recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage with a more mature customer base higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 46700 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable longterm growth 

  

rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2014 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8450 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

 

  

 rental and management operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

network development services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” and adjusted funds from operations “affo” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations net income loss on equity method investments income tax benefit provision other income expense gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and dividends declared on preferred stock and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interest 

  

we define affo as nareit ffo before i straightline revenue and expense ii stockbased compensation expense iii the noncash portion of our tax provision iv nonreal estate related depreciation amortization and accretion v amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and longterm deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii gain loss on retirement of longterm obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interest less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures 

adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap neither nareit ffo nor affo represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 5 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo may not however be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies reconciliations of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure have been included below 

results of operations 

years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

in thousands except percentages 

revenue 

 

 the increase in total revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 21520 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since january 1 2013 approximately 2606 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by mipt

 international rental and management segment gross margin growth for the year ended december 31 2014 was comprised of 

 

  

  

  

 network development services segment gross margin growth for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to the increase in revenue as described above 

selling general administrative and development expense 

 

 the increase in domestic rental and management segment selling general administrative and development expense “sga” for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily driven by increasing personnel costs to support our business including additional costs associated with the acquisition of mipt as well as an increase of approximately 110 million associated with project cancellation costs 

the increase in international rental and management segment sga for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to the impact of increased personnel costs to support our business including additional costs associated with acquisitions partially offset by decreases attributable to impacts of foreign currency fluctuations as well as the reversal of bad debt expense for amounts previously reserved 

the increase in network development services segment sga for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to the additional site acquisition zoning and permitting services associated with certain tenants’ next generation technology network upgrade projects including an increase in volume as a result of the additional sites acquired as part of the acquisition of mipt 

  

the decrease in other sga for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in corporate sga of 155 million which was partially offset by an increase of 117 million related to stockbased compensation expense the decrease in corporate sga was primarily related to a reduction in legal expenses of 225 million including the recovery of expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 and the reversal of a 28 million reserve associated with a nonrecurring state tax item the decrease in corporate sga was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs to support our business 

operating profit 

 

 domestic rental and management segment operating profit growth for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin 19 and was partially offset by an increase in our domestic rental and management segment sga 20 

international rental and management segment operating profit growth for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin 20 and was partially offset by an increase in our international rental and management segment sga 9 

network development services segment operating profit growth for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in network development services segment gross margin 27 and was partially offset by an increase in our network development services segment sga 35 

depreciation amortization and accretion 

 

 the increase in depreciation amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to the depreciation amortization and accretion expense associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 21520 sites since january 1 2013 which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 

other operating expenses 

 

 the decrease in other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease of 40 million from impairment charges and net losses on sales or disposals of longlived assets and was partially offset by a net increase of 24 million in integration acquisition and merger related costs 

  

interest income tv azteca net

distributions as a reit we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain generally we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of nols since our conversion to a reit in 2012 we have distributed an aggregate of approximately 13 billion to our common stockholders which is primarily taxed as ordinary income 

  

the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 in thousands 

 

   

  

   

           offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

interest rate swap agreements  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia and south africa all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 799 million interest rates ranging from 574 to 783 and expiration dates through april 2021 in february 2014 we repaid the costa rica loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements additionally in connection with entering into the colombian credit facility in october 2014 we terminated our preexisting interest rate 

  

swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 1000 billion cop approximately 418 million 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity 

internally generated funds  because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2014 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities  the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility the 2013 credit facility and the 2013 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to i total leverage ii senior secured leverage and iii interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 600 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we could incur approximately 17 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 291 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio on february 20 2015 we entered into amendments to the 2013 term loan 2013 credit facility and 2014 credit facility pursuant to which this ratio will be increased upon the closing of the proposed verizon transaction 

consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we could incur approximately 45 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 17 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 15 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio 

interest coverage ratio in the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade we will be required to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 our interest expense which was 549 million for that period could increase by approximately 532 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 13 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 

  

the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the securitization and the gtp notes  the first amended and restated loan and security agreement related to the securitization the “loan agreement” and indentures governing the gtp notes the “gtp indentures” include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc the “borrowers” and the gtp issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture 

under the terms of the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the nonrecourse loan relating to the securitization the “loan” or the gtp notes as applicable which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes are released to the borrowers or the applicable gtp issuer which can then be distributed to and used by us during the year ended december 31 2014 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of 7157 million and the gtp issuers have distributed excess cash to us of 1641 million 

in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers and the gtp issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio “dscr” calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the loan or the principal amount of the gtp notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination plus the amounts payable for trustee and servicing fees if the dscr with respect to the secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 20132a issued in our securitization the “securities” or any series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners is equal to or below 130x the “cash trap dscr” at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters or if the dscr with respect to any series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of securities or gtp notes under the loan agreement or gtp indentures as applicable will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the borrowers or the gtp issuers the funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the borrowers or gtp partners for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of securities or gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters likewise the funds in the reserve account will not be released to gtp cellular sites for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar months 

  

additionally an “amortization period” commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites if the dscr of such series equals or falls below 115x the “minimum dscr” the “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters similarly the “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar months 

if on the anticipated repayment date the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the securities has not been paid in full an “amortization period” will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of securities is repaid in full 

during an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of securities or series of gtp notes on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the securities or series of gtp notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement or the gtp indentures as applicable 

consequently a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers or gtp issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements make mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend payments and fund our stock repurchase program if the borrowers were to default on the loan the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the 5195 wireless and broadcast communications towers that secure the loan the “secured towers” in which case we could lose the secured towers and the revenue associated with those towers in addition upon occurrence and during an event of default the trustee may in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of gtp notes declare such series of gtp notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such gtp notes furthermore if the gtp issuers were to default on a series of the gtp notes the trustee may demand collect take possession of receive settle compromise adjust sue for foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the 2845 towers and 1035 property interests and other related assets that secure the gtp notes the “gtp secured sites” securing such series of the gtp notes in which case we could lose the gtp secured sites and the revenue associated with those assets 

as of december 31 2014 the borrowers’ dscr was 1022x based on the borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 4286 million in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 4358 million in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr as of december 31 2014 the dscr of gtp partners and gtp cellular sites were 288x and 254x respectively based on the net cash flow of gtp partners and gtp cellular sites for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of gtp notes gtp partners and gtp cellular sites could endure a reduction of approximately 687 million and 164 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 752 million and 184 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital 

  

through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements pay mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2014 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 

 we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 

we review our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows 

if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

 

   

goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

during the year ended december 31 2014 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin 

 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 132 million during the year ended december 31 2014 the change in 2014 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 

  

   

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 56 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 

  

  

 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 

  

realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states

 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia and south africa in connection with entering into the colombian credit facility in october 

  

2014 we terminated our preexisting interest rate swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 1000 billion cop approximately 418 million all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 799 million interest rates ranging from 574 to 783 and expiration dates through april 2021 

changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2014 was comprised of 15000 million under the 2013 term loan 11000 million under the 2014 credit facility 2634 million under the mexican loan 1187 million under the br towers debentures 690 million under the uganda loan 371 million under the south african facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements 418 million under the colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and 76 million under sublimit a and sublimit c under the br towers credit facility a 10 increase in current interest rates would result in an additional 70 million of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2014 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of aoci we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 33 of our revenues and approximately 39 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by approximately 3 

as of december 31 2014 we have incurred intercompany debt which is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being of longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately 185 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2014

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in october 2013 we significantly expanded our portfolio through our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc “mipt” a private reit and parent company to global tower partners “gtp” an owner and operator of approximately 5370 communications sites through its various operating subsidiaries in the united states costa rica and panama gtp also manages rooftops and holds property interests that it leases to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we believe the acquisition provides us with key strategic and financial advantages due to the high quality of the assets which are in locations complementary to our portfolio for more information on our acquisition of mipt see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist of our operations in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda 

our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

products and services 

rental and management operations 

our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98 97 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our tenants lease space on our communications site real estate where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations property taxes and repairs and maintenance our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 

  

  

  

  

   

our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enable us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers in the united states as well as customers in a number of other industries our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65 67 and 72 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

our international rental and management segment which is comprised of communications sites in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda provides a source of growth and diversification including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33 30 and 26 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks rooftop management the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators domestically 

communications towers approximately 96 96 and 98 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including personal communications services cellular voice and data broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows 

 

  

 accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites 

 

   

  

  

 network development services 

through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 2 3 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure 

 

   

  

  

  

 capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital to maintain our reit status we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt to reduce our net leverage to be within our longterm target range accordingly we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and acquisitions in addition we intend to return our remaining excess capital if any to stockholders through our stock repurchase program or by declaring special distributions from time to time during 2013 we generated 16 billion of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 52 billion of investments including 45 billion of acquisitions and 7245 million of 

  

capital expenditures in addition in 2013 we repurchased 1450 million including commissions and fees of our common stock and paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 4347 million to our stockholders 

 

  

  

 international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing independent wireless real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses 

 

  

  

 recent transactions 

acquisitions 

from january 1 2013 through december 31 2013 we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 13070 sites including approximately 2370 buildtosuits and we believe the assets acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013 included 

 

   

  

  

 we continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

financing transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we raised capital thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant financing transactions in 2013 included those set forth below for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

securitization in march 2013 we completed a securitization transaction the “securitization” involving assets related to 5195 wireless and broadcast communications towers the “secured towers” owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries through a private offering of 18 billion of secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 2013 2a collectively the “securities” we used the net proceeds from the securitization to refinance the 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 issued in the securitization transaction completed in may 2007 the “certificates” 

senior notes offerings in january 2013 we completed a registered public offering of 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 350 senior unsecured notes due 2023 the “350 notes” in august 2013 we completed a registered public offering of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 340 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the “340 notes” and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 500 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the “500 notes” we used the net proceeds from each of these notes offerings primarily to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities 

credit facilities we increased our borrowing capacity and financial flexibility by entering into a multicurrency 15 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in june 2013 which was subsequently increased to 20 billion the “2013 credit facility” and a 364day 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in september 2013 the “shortterm credit facility” as a result as of december 31 2013 we had the ability to borrow up to 20 billion under our existing credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit we also entered into a 15 billion unsecured term loan in october 2013 the “2013 term loan” and repaid our 7500 million unsecured term loan entered into in june 2012 the “2012 term loan” 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 67 of our total rental and management 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license “ipi” issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recommended to the indian department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership to date such changes have not been formally adopted in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the “bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid and accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades for instance in june 2012 the chilean government passed legislation retroactively imposing certain zoning restrictions on telecommunications towers in response to which we developed a remediation plan existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations 

  

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

environmental matters our domestic and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

customer demand 

our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

  

  

  

 we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends 

our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the provider’s license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to 

  

widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

furthermore the demand for broadcast space in the united states and mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants’ networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially adversely affect our growth and revenues for example in the united states recently combined companies have either rationalized or announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites we would expect a similar outcome in certain other countries where we do business if consolidation of certain tenants occurs in addition certain combined companies have modernized or are currently modernizing their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 145 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 20 billion under our credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of 

  

interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 

our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable and the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage 

increasing competition in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect us 

we may experience increased competition which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly some of our competitors such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate 

the higher prices for assets combined with the competitive pricing pressure on tenant leases could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria increasing competition for either tower assets or tenants could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations assets and personnel 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and 

  

financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel 

furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel and the other risks described immediately below in “—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” as a result our foreign operations and expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 33 of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations compared to 30 for the year ended december 31 2012 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income 

in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants for the year ended december 31 2013 four tenants accounted for approximately 83 of our domestic rental and management segment revenue and five tenants accounted for approximately 55 of our international rental and management segment revenue if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

additionally due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures downturns in the economy and disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may fail to realize the growth prospects and cost savings anticipated as a result of and will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated integration costs in connection with our acquisition of mipt 

the success of the acquisition of mipt will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with those of mipt we may never realize 

  

these business opportunities and growth prospects or we may encounter unanticipated accounting internal control regulatory or compliance problems 

in addition we and mipt have operated independently as a result there may be a disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses tax costs or inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards controls information technology systems procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with tenants employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could harm our financial performance we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges in connection with integrating mipt including severance and charges associated with integrating process and systems we currently cannot identify the timing nature and amount of all such charges further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to this integration will offset incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all we also expect to incur costs to implement such efficiencies in that regard because mipt is a private company we may be required to improve mipt’s internal controls procedures and policies to meet standards applicable to public companies which may be timeconsuming and more expensive than anticipated 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in the delivery of wireless communications radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available 

effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply 

qualification as a reit requires application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

   

  

 any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and operations would be reduced 

furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mipt we own an interest in a subsidiary reit the subsidiary reit is independently subject to and must comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax ii the subsidiary reit will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost iii our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we will fail to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

we may be limited in our ability to fund required distributions using cash generated through our trss 

as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain our ability to receive distributions from our trss to fund these distributions is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our communications sites and qualified rentalrelated services consequently no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income thus our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy 

specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be 

  

adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing 

in addition to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to fund these distributions even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities sell assets or raise equity we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2014 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures required reit distribution payments and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations through 2014 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 88 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2013 are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases approximately 74 of the ground 

  

leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2023 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets 

the agreements for our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and could thus limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

we may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings 

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired these circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income a significant adverse change in the business climate a decline in market capitalization or slower growth rates in our industry among others if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

it is possible that in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets these charges could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health or environmental effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials and for damages and costs relating to offsite migration of hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our towers or data centers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers or certain unforeseen events may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event if we are unable to provide services to our tenants it could lead to tenant loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 2 properties tableend details of each of our principal offices as of december 31 2013 are provided below 

 

  

     

in addition to the principal offices set forth above we maintain offices in the geographic areas we serve through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses as well as maintain offices to pursue international business development initiatives we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs 

as of december 31 2013 we owned and operated a portfolio of 67418 communications sites in the united states brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda see the table in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites in addition we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators in the united states which are included in our domestic rental and management segment 

domestic rental and management segment  our interests in our domestic communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities pursuant to the loan agreement for the securitization the 5195 towers in the united states subject to the securitization transaction as of december 31 2013 are subject to mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan in addition 1470 property interests in the united states are subject to mortgages and deeds of trust to secure three separate classes of secured cellular site revenue notes the “unison notes” assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain legal entities from unison holdings llc and unison site management ii llc the “unison acquisition” in connection with our acquisition of mipt we assumed approximately 149 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness under six series consisting of eleven separate classes of secured tower revenue notes issued by certain subsidiaries of gtp in several securitization transactions the “gtp notes” the gtp notes are secured by among other things 3893 towers and 1717 property interests and other related assets 

a typical domestic tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment the principal types of our domestic towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole 

 

  

  

 international rental and management segment  our interests in our international communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by private or government entities our financings in colombia costa rica and south africa are secured by an aggregate of 2148 towers 

a typical international tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure backup or auxiliary power generators and batteries and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment the four principal types of our international towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice monopole and rooftop guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole structures are similar to those in our domestic segment rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet 

  

ground leases of the 67069 towers in our portfolio as of december 31 2013 approximately 88 were located on land we lease domestically ground leases for land under our towers generally have a term of approximately twenty to twentyfive years which is comprised of an initial term of approximately five years with three or four automatic fiveyear renewal periods internationally ground leases or similar agreements that grant use rights for land underlying our towers typically also have a term of approximately twenty to twentyfive years which is comprised of an initial term ranging from five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods as a result approximately 74 of the ground agreements for our sites have a final expiration date of 2023 and beyond

executive overview 

our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012 

  

the following table details the number of communications sites we owned or operated as of december 31 2013 

 

  

 the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2013 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2013 we expect to generate approximately 23 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation approximately 3035 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets 

the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2013 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 15 of our rental and management operations revenues 

rental and management operations revenue growth  our rental and management revenue growth is comprised of i growth in organic revenue which is revenue from sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period “legacy sites” and ii growth from sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period “new sites” the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our domestic and international rental and management segments are 

 

  

  

  

   

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases these sites’ utilization and profitability in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition consistent with our strategic acquisition of mipt we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria 

rental and management operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth 

 

 we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 

  

  

  

 we have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites 

  

 in emerging markets such as india ghana and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are also underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate 

in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on third generation 3g network build outs with select investments in fourth generation 4g technology recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service 

finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and panama carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage with a more mature customer base higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity 

we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 39400 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable longterm growth 

rental and management operations new site revenue growth the results of operations of mipt have been included in our consolidated results of operations since october 1 2013 the date of the acquisition during the period from october 1 2013 to december 31 2013 mipt generated total revenues of 841 million and gross margin of 650 million in addition to the approximately 5370 sites acquired through the acquisition of mipt during the year ended december 31 2013 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7700 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues such as ground rent or fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

 

  

   

network development services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades 

rental and management operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance security and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments’ selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit ffo” and adjusted funds from operations “affo” 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations net income loss on equity method investments income tax provision benefit other income expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating income expense depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

nareit ffo is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate real estate related impairment charges and real estate related depreciation amortization and accretion and including adjustments for i unconsolidated affiliates and ii noncontrolling interest 

we define affo as nareit ffo before i straightline revenue and expense ii stockbased compensation expense iii the noncash portion of our tax provision iv nonreal estate related depreciation amortization and accretion v amortization of deferred financing costs capitalized interest debt discounts and premiums and longterm deferred interest charges vi other income expense vii loss on retirement of longterm obligations viii other operating income expense and adjustments for ix unconsolidated affiliates and x noncontrolling interest less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures 

adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap neither nareit ffo nor affo represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a 

  

key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 5 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo may not however be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies reconciliations of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure have been included below

distributions as a reit we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain generally we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed reit taxable income the amount timing and frequency of future distributions however will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we declared an aggregate of 4345 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders which included our fourth quarter distribution of approximately 1145 million on december 31 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 16 2013 for more details on the regular cash distributions paid to our stockholders during the year ended december 31 2013 see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

we accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock unit awards granted subsequent to january 1 2012 which are payable upon vesting as of december 31 2013 we accrued 19 million of distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units during the year ended december 31 2013 we paid 02 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units

 offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

interest rate swap agreements  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia costa rica and south africa all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 1393 million interest rates ranging from 162 to 783 and expiration dates through november 2020 on february 12 2014 we repaid the costa rica loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

internally generated funds  because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2013 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to 

  

generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities  the loan agreements for the 2012 credit facility the 2013 credit facility the shortterm credit facility and the 2013 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 650 to 100 through september 30 2014 and of 600 to 100 thereafter based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we could incur approximately 12 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 185 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 

consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt as defined in the loan agreements to adjusted ebitda of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we could incur approximately 34 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 12 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 11 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio 

interest coverage ratio in the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade we will be required to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 our interest expense which was 447 million for that period could increase by approximately 500 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 12 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under agreements relating to the securitization and the gtp notes  the loan agreement related to the securitization and the gtp indentures include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and 

  

other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers and gtp issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the loan agreement and gtp indentures 

under the terms of the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes as applicable which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes are released to the borrowers or the applicable gtp issuer which can then be distributed to and used by us since the inception of the loan in march 2013 through december 31 2013 the borrowers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately 4961 million since our assumption of the gtp notes on october 1 2013 through december 31 2013 the gtp issuers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately 488 million 

in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers and the gtp issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio “dscr” calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the loan or the principal amount of the gtp notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination plus the amount of the payable trustee and servicing fees if the dscr with respect to the securities or any series of gtp notes issued by gtp towers or gtp partners is equal to or below 130x the “cash trap dscr” at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters or if the dscr with respect to any series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of securities or gtp notes under the loan agreement or gtp indentures as applicable will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the borrowers or the gtp issuers the funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the borrowers gtp towers or gtp partners for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of securities or gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters likewise the funds in the reserve account will not be released to gtp cellular sites for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar months 

additionally an “amortization period” commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp towers and gtp partners and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites if the dscr of such series equals or falls below 115x the “minimum dscr” the “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp towers and gtp partners for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters similarly the “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar months 

if on the anticipated repayment date the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the securities has not been paid in full an “amortization period” will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of securities is repaid in full 

during an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of securities or series of gtp notes on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further 

  

additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the securities or series of gtp notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement or indentures as applicable 

consequently a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers or gtp issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program if the borrowers were to default on the loan the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured towers in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers in addition upon occurrence and during an event of default the trustee may in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of gtp notes declare such series of gtp notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such gtp notes furthermore if the gtp issuers were to default on a series of the gtp notes the trustee may demand collect take possession of receive settle compromise adjust sue for foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the gtp secured towers securing such series in which case we could lose the gtp secured towers and the revenue associated with those assets 

as of december 31 2013 the borrowers’ dscr was 934x based on the borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2013 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 383 million in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 390 million in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr as of december 31 2013 the dscr of gtp towers gtp partners and gtp cellular sites were 353x 284x and 248x respectively based on the net cash flow of gtp towers gtp partners and gtp cellular sites for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2013 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of gtp notes gtp towers gtp partners and gtp cellular sites could endure a reduction of approximately 290 million 668 million and 157 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 310 million 733 million and 177 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets asset retirement 

  

obligations accounting for acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2013 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 

 we monitor our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the asset’s carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

 

 goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin except for one reporting unit whose fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 143 million for this reporting unit we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of i a 2 reduction in projected revenues ii a 60 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or iii a 20 reduction in terminal sales growth rate individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions 

the goodwill recorded in this reporting unit approximated 154 million as of december 31 2013 and is the result of recently completed acquisitions accordingly the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due in part to the timing of the underlying acquisition current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business 

 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 103 million during the year ended december 31 2013 the change in 2013 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 

  

   

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 55 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 

  

   

  

 accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income 

we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” issued additional guidance on comprehensive income which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” by component this guidance enhances the transparency of changes in other comprehensive income “oci” and items transferred out of aoci in the financial statements and it does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or oci in the financial statements since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued guidance that clarifies the scope of transactions subject to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position this guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after 

  

january 1 2013 on a retrospective basis since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in july 2013 the fasb issued guidance that requires an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward with certain exceptions the amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements

we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia costa rica and south africa all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 1393 million interest rates ranging from 162 to 783 and expiration dates through november 2020 on february 12 2014 we repaid the costa rica loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements 

changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2013 was comprised of 880 million under the 2012 credit facility 18530 million under the 2013 credit facility 15000 million under the 2013 term loan 669 million under the uganda loan 436 million under the south african facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements 175 million under the colombian longterm credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements 3775 million under the mexican loan and 56 million under the costa rica loan after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements a 10 increase in current interest rates would result in an additional 74 million of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity and as a component of comprehensive income loss we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 33 of our revenues and approximately 40 of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by approximately 3 

as of december 31 2013 we have incurred a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt which is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being of longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately 2286 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2013

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

american tower corporation 

boston massachusetts 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of american tower corporation and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 31 2013 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at mip tower holdings llc which was acquired on october 1 2013 and whose financial statements constitute 25 of total assets and 3 of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at mip tower holdings llc the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2013 of the company and our report dated february 25 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading independent owner operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 we also offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites effective january 1 2012 we reorganized to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes the “reit conversion” 

our communications real estate portfolio of 54604 sites as of december 31 2012 includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system “das” networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2012 22534 towers domestically and 31789 towers internationally in addition our portfolio also includes 281 das networks that we operate primarily in malls and casinos and select outdoor environments we also manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as well as hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators 

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist of our operations in brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda 

our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” a trs is a subsidiary of a reit that is subject to applicable corporate income tax our use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings the nonreit qualified businesses that we hold through trss include our network development services segment in addition we have included our international operations and managed networks business within our trss we are currently considering changing the election of one or more of our previously designated trss which hold certain of our international operations to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities “qrss” and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss 

  

as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing towers however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

annually as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain our reit taxable income typically will not include income earned by our trss except to the extent the trss pay dividends in 2012 we paid regular cash distributions of an aggregate of approximately 3556 million to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

products and services 

rental and management operations 

our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 97 98 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our tenants lease space on our communications site infrastructure where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations property taxes and repairs and maintenance in most of our international markets a portion of our operating costs is passed through to our tenants such as ground rent or fuel costs our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 

  

  

   

  

 our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enables us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers in the united states as well as customers in a number of other industries our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 67 72 and 79 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our international rental and management segment which is comprised of communications sites in brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda provides a source of diversification and growth our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 30 26 and 19 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks rooftop management the leasing of property interests and the installation of shared generators domestically 

communications towers we own and operate communications towers in the united states brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda approximately 96 98 and 98 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including personal communications services cellular broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio wimax paging and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows 

 

  

 accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

managed networks rooftop management property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide 

  

communications site management services to third parties manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites 

 

  

  

  

 network development services 

through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 3 2 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices as well as the expanding 

infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to 

  

achieve this our primary focus is to increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio further improve upon our operational performance and maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure 

 

  

  

  

 capital allocation strategy 

as a reit we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain which is our first priority within our capital allocation strategy after our reit distributions we expect to continue to deploy our discretionary capital through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and through acquisitions the objective of our allocation of our discretionary capital is to simultaneously increase recurring free cash flow and our return on invested capital in addition we intend to return our remaining excess discretionary capital if any to stockholders through continuing our stock repurchase program or declaring special distributions from time to time during 2012 we generated 14144 million of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 29843 million of investments including 5680 million of capital expenditures 19980 million of acquisitions and 627 million of stock repurchases including commissions and fees during 2012 we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 3556 million to our stockholders 

 

   

  

  

 international growth strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by establishing an independent wireless infrastructure leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved in addition we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses 

 

  

  

 growth and expansion 

in 2012 we continued to focus on growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions including expansion into new international markets and new site development consistent with our international growth strategy during the year ended december 31 2012 we grew our communications real estate portfolio through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8790 towers the installation of approximately 20 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators on our sites in the united states in addition we continue to evaluate complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business 

united states  we continued to build on our established foundation in the united states growing our domestic communications sites portfolio by 6 during the year ended december 31 2012 primarily through the acquisition and construction of communications sites in select locations throughout the country our expansion in 

  

the united states during 2012 included the acquisition and construction of approximately 945 towers the installation of approximately 15 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators on our sites 

international  during 2012 we took additional steps to position ourselves for expansion into new international markets after announcing the launch of operations in uganda at the end of 2011 we acquired approximately 960 towers through our joint venture during the first half of 2012 in addition in november 2012 we announced that we had launched operations in germany and subsequently completed the purchase of approximately 2030 towers in the fourth quarter of 2012 thereby expanding our international footprint to ten countries as of december 31 2012 our international expansion efforts during 2012 also included the acquisition and construction in the aggregate of approximately 4855 towers and the installation of five inbuilding das networks in our existing markets 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 69 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and painted lighted and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders 

furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license “ipi” issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recommended to the department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 “the bbbee act” has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid and accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose certain permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations these regulations vary but typically require tower owners andor our tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower 

  

construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted new regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations in june 2012 the chilean government passed a new law that imposes certain zoning restrictions retroactively on telecommunications towers located throughout chile and may require us to modify or remove certain of our existing towers 

portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec status or other similar status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants both domestic and international may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites 

environmental matters our domestic and international operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or waste certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we also may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding a new antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

our rental and management segments compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers and private tower companies 

  

independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ internal staffs we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

customer demand 

our strategy is predicated on our belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites 

 

  

  

  

  

 as these factors continue to grow as a competitive necessity in the united states on a widespread basis wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

  

  

  

 we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate access to their markets and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain 

  

their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends 

our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies andor the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investment away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or permit equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed 2432 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

furthermore the demand for broadcast space in the united states and mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budget allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants’ network investment away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of wireless communications radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space further 

  

a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction of communications sites in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our tenants consolidate merge or share site infrastructure with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites because certain portions of these tenants’ networks may be redundant for example in the united states recently combined companies have either rationalized or announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites we would expect a similar outcome in certain other countries where we do business if consolidation of certain tenants occurs in addition certain combined companies have undergone or are currently undergoing a modernization of their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our communications sites 

we could suffer adverse tax or other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we periodically are subject to examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business and we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future moreover the internal revenue service and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a reit or with respect to our trss in which case either we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties if any or we will offset additional income as determined by a tax authority with our nols if we offset such additional income with our nols our required distributions to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit will increase and we may be required to pay deficiency dividends and an associated interest charge if our prior reit distributions were insufficient in light of the reduced available nols 

  

in addition domestic and international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge if there are tax benefits that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or use our nols or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities all of which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants for the year ended december 31 2012 four tenants accounted for approximately 74 of our domestic rental and management segment revenue and five tenants accounted for approximately 55 of our international rental and management segment revenue if any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

additionally due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage some of our tenants may experience financial difficulty or may file for bankruptcy in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures downturns in the economy and disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 30 of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations compared to 26 for the year ended december 31 2011 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture 

we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would have a negative impact on our reported revenues operating profits and income 

our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations assets and personnel 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel in a timely and efficient manner integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes potential cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition the integration of businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel 

furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel and the other risks 

  

described above in “—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” as a result our foreign operations and expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 88 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2012 are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases approximately 78 of the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2022 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do 

competitive pricing for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income as well as require us to pay significantly more to acquire assets in addition we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated 

our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we would lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available 

we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 if we fail to qualify as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply we believe that we are organized and will qualify as a reit upon timely filing our federal income tax return for 2012 and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot guarantee that we will qualify or remain so qualified including if our board of directors determines it is no longer in our interests to be a reit 

qualification as a reit requires application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the code provisions 

for instance the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25 of the fair market value of our assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

  

  

 any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and operations would be reduced 

we may be limited in our ability to fund required distributions using cash generated through our trss 

as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain timing differences between the receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes as well as the effect of nondeductible expenditures may impair our ability to fund required distributions if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and as a result may fail to qualify for taxation as a reit to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code 

our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our communications sites and rentalrelated services consequently no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income thus our ability to receive 

  

distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders specifically if our trss become highly profitable we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy we could also be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments and could be limited in our ability to hedge liabilities and risks furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing in addition we may receive pressure from investors not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to fund these distributions even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 35 on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period generally ten years after the reit conversion up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2012 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis as of january 1 2012 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not 

  

expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability but our plans may change in the future 

we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities sell assets or raise equity we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2013 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures required reit distribution payments and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations through 2013 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings additionally a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us 

in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short and longterm debt to sell assets or to offer equity securities furthermore the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 88 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 07 billion under our credit facilities our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 

our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our business results of operations or financial condition including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreements related to our securitization transaction the loan agreements for our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreement related to our securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers subject to the securitization transaction and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan the servicer on the loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction in which case we could lose such towers and the excess cash flow associated with such towers 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and could thus limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our indentures restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we would be subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings 

we review goodwill and intangible assets annually to determine if it is impaired or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment these circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income a significant adverse change in the business climate a decline in market capitalization or slower growth rates in our industry among others if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

  

while we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2012 it is possible that in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets these charges could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have limited experience operating as a reit which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we have only been operating as a reit since january 1 2012 accordingly the experience of our senior management operating a reit is limited and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or remain qualified as a reit failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our towers or data centers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers or certain unforeseen events may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event if we are unable to provide services to our tenants it could lead to tenant loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of 

  

tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health or environmental effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters

in addition to the principal offices set forth above we maintain offices in the geographic areas we serve through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses as well as maintain offices to pursue international business development initiatives we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs 

as of december 31 2012 we own and operate a portfolio of 54604 communications sites in the united states brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda see the table in item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—executive overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites in addition we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators in the united states which are included in our domestic rental and management segment 

domestic rental and management segment  our interests in our domestic communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities pursuant to the loan agreement for our securitization transaction the 5278 tower sites in the united states subject to our securitization transaction as of december 31 2012 are subject to mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan in addition 1471 property interests in the united states are subject to mortgages and deeds of trust to secure notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain legal entities from unison holdings llc and unison site management ii llc the “unison acquisition” 

a typical domestic tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment the principal types of our domestic towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole 

 

  

  

 international rental and management segment  our interests in our international communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by private or government entities 

a typical international tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure backup or auxiliary power generators and batteries and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment the four principal types of our international towers are guyed selfsupporting lattice monopole and rooftop guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole structures are similar to those in our domestic segment rooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet 

of the 54604 communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2012 approximately 88 are located on land we lease domestically ground leases for land underlying our towers generally have a term of 

  

approximately twenty to twentyfive years which is comprised of an initial term of approximately five years with three or four automatic fiveyear renewal periods internationally ground leases or similar agreements that grant use rights for land underlying our towers typically also have a term of approximately twenty to twentyfive years which is comprised of an initial term ranging from five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods as a result approximately 78 of the ground agreements for our sites have a final expiration date of 2022 and beyond 

tenants  our tenants are primarily wireless service providers broadcasters and other communications service providers as of december 31 2012 our four top tenants by revenue were att mobility 18 sprint nextel 14 verizon wireless 11 and tmobile usa 8 in general our tenant leases have an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter as a result approximately 79 of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2018 or beyond

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on june 2 2011 we received a subpoena from the sec requesting certain documents from 2007 through the date of the subpoena including in particular documents related to our tax accounting and reporting on november 6 2012 the sec notified us that its investigation has been completed the sec indicated that it does not intend to recommend any enforcement action against us 

one of our subsidiaries spectrasite communications inc “sci” a predecessor in interest by conversion to spectrasite communications llc was involved in a lawsuit brought in mexico against a former mexican subsidiary of sci the subsidiary of sci was sold in 2002 prior to our acquisition of sci in 2005 the lawsuit concerns a terminated tower construction contract and related agreements with a wireless carrier in mexico the primary issue for us is whether sci itself can be found liable to the mexican carrier the trial and lower appellate courts initially found that sci had no such liability in part because mexican courts did not have the necessary jurisdiction over sci in september 2010 following several decisions by mexican appellate courts including the supreme court of mexico and related appeals by both parties an intermediate appellate court issued a new decision that would have if enforceable reimposed liability on sci if the primary defendant in the case were unable to satisfy the judgment in its decision the intermediate appellate court identified potential damages in the form of potential statutory interest of approximately 67 million as of that date on october 14 2010 we filed a new constitutional appeal to again dispute the decision which was rejected on january 24 2012 the case was returned to the trial court to determine whether any actual damages should be awarded to the mexican carrier on august 2 2012 the trial court entered judgment against the primary defendant and sci in the amount of approximately 65 million each party appealed the trial court’s determination and on october 17 2012 the appellate court entered judgment against the primary defendant in the amount of approximately 79 million with sci responsible for any amount not recoverable from the primary defendant on november 9 2012 sci filed a constitutional appeal of the appellate court ruling in connection with our acquisition of a portfolio of communications sites from the mexican carrier on january 31 2013 the mexican carrier released all of its claims against sci including any obligation of sci to pay any damages 

we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel there are no matters currently pending that would in the event of an adverse outcome have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

executive overview 

our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012 

  

the following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of december 31 2012 

 

  

 the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2012 we expect to generate approximately 20 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods excluding the impact of straightline lease accounting in addition most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed percentage on average approximately 35 in the united states inflation or inflation with a fixed minimum or maximum escalation for the year revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the noncancellable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants which increases the noncancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues 

the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 

revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2012 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 13 of our rental and management operations revenues 

rental and management operations revenue growth  the primary factors affecting the revenue growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are 

 

  

  

  

   

we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their networks as well as roll out next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria 

rental and management operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth 

 

 we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us 

 

  

  

  

 we signed holistic master lease agreements with three of our four major tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue growth and a reduction in the potential impact of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and foster strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly deploy technology on our sites 

 

   

 rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2012 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of approximately 8810 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

 

  

 network development services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades 

rental and management operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance security and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

  

reit conversion  we began operating as a reit effective january 1 2012 the reit tax rules require that we derive most of our income other than income generated by a trs from investments in real estate which for us primarily consists of income from the leasing of our communications sites under the code maintaining reit status generally requires that no more than 25 of the value of the reit’s assets be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets 

a reit must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain during the year ended december 31 2012 we paid an aggregate of approximately 3556 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

for more information on the requirements to qualify as a reit see item 1 of this annual report under the caption “business—overview” and item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available” and “—certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities” 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations net income loss from equity method investments income tax provision benefit other income expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating expenses depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 it is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature and 5 it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of longterm strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company such as decisions with respect to capital structure capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure has been included below

selling general administrative and development expense 

 

 total selling general administrative and development expense “sga” for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 13 to 3273 million the increase was attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments as well as an increase in our other sga 

  

domestic rental and management segment sga for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 11 to 857 million the increase was primarily attributable to the impact of initiatives that we launched during 2011 designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio including increased staffing in field operations sales and finance and other functions supporting the expansion of our business 

international rental and management segment sga for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 16 to 956 million the increase was primarily attributable to the launch of operations in our new markets as well as our continued investments in international expansion initiatives in foreign operations partially offset by the reversal of approximately 38 million of bad debt expense in mexico for amounts previously reserved 

network development services segment sga for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 14 to 67 million the decrease was primarily attributable to the reversal of bad debt expense upon the receipt of a customer payment for amounts previously reserved partially offset by higher personnel related costs 

other sga for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 14 to 1393 million the increase was primarily due to a 124 million increase in corporate expenses and a 51 million increase in sga related stockbased compensation expense the increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee costs of approximately 87 million associated with supporting a growing global organization and a 37 million nonrecurring state tax expense 

operating profit 

 

 domestic rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 14 to 14975 million the growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin 14 as described above and was partially offset by increases in our domestic rental and management segment sga 11 as described above

network development services segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 54 to 309 million the growth was primarily attributable to the increase in network development services segment gross margin and the decrease in sga as described above 

depreciation amortization and accretion 

 

   

depreciation amortization and accretion for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 16 to 6443 million the increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 19280 sites since january 1 2011 which resulted in an increase in property and equipment 

other operating expenses 

 

 other operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 7 to 622 million this change was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 170 million in impairment charges and loss on disposal of assets which included an impairment charge of 108 million of one of our outdoor das networks upon the termination of a tenant lease during the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately 129 million in acquisition related costs and nonrecurring consulting and legal costs incurred in 2011 associated with our reit conversion 

interest expense 

 

 interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 29 to 4017 million the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding of approximately 16173 million which was primarily used to fund our recent acquisitions and an increase in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 532 to 537 

other expense 

 

 other expense for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 69 to 383 million the decrease was primarily a result of a decline in unrealized currency losses of 968 million during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately 343 million resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies and other expenses of approximately 40 million during the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately 1311 million and other miscellaneous income of 81 million

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased 14 to 1073 million the effective tax rate “etr” for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased to 153 from 247 this decrease was primarily attributable to our dividend paid deduction and decreased state taxes during the year ended december 31 2012 partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets arose primarily as a result of purchase accounting and existing nols which were generated partly from interest on intercompany debt 

as a reit we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated in our qrss and in addition we are able to offset income in both our trss and qrss by utilizing our nols subject to specified limitations 

the etr on income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our expected qualification for taxation as a reit effective as of january 1 2012 and to adjustments for foreign items 

net incomeadjusted ebitda 

 

 net income for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 56 to 5940 million the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our rental and management segments operating profit as described above as well as decreases in unrealized foreign currency losses and income tax provision partially offset by increases in depreciation amortization and accretion and interest expense 

adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 19 to 18924 million adjusted ebitda growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our rental and management segments gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in sga

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as a holding company our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt offerings as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 11032 million of total liquidity comprised of 3686 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow up to 7346 million net of any outstanding letters of credit under our 10 billion unsecured credit facility entered into in april 2011 the “2011 credit facility” and our 10 billion unsecured credit facility entered into in january 2012 the “2012 credit facility” in january 2013 we completed a registered public offering of 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 350 senior unsecured notes due 2023 “350 notes” and used the net proceeds to partially repay amounts outstanding under the 2011 credit facility and 2012 credit facility which increased our total liquidity by 10 billion summary cash flow information for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is set forth below in thousands 

 

   

we use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business including tower maintenance and improvements communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions additionally we use our cash flows to make distributions of our reit taxable income in order to maintain our reit qualification under the code and fund our stock repurchase program our significant financing transactions in 2012 included the following 

 

  

  

 as of december 31 2012 we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately 88 billion during the year ended december 31 2012 we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations as well as our required reit distributions in 2012 we believe cash generated by our operations for the year ending december 31 2013 will also be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures our debt service interest and principal repayments obligations and reit distribution requirements for 2013 if our pending acquisitions capital expenditures or debt repayments exceed the cash generated by operations we believe we have sufficient borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to fund our activities as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 1568 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries of which 636 million was held by our joint ventures historically it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs however in the event that we do repatriate any funds we may be required to accrue and pay taxes 

as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain generally we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income so as not to be subject to the income or excise tax on undistributed reit taxable income in 2012 we declared aggregate distributions of 090 per share and made total distributions of 3556 million to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be based upon various factors see item 5 of this annual report under the caption “dividends” for a discussion of those factors considered

contractual obligations our contractual obligations relate primarily to the commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 issued in our may 2007 securitization transaction the “securitization” borrowings under our credit facilities our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of december 31 2012 in thousands 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

interest rate swap agreements  as of december 31 2012 we held ten interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which had an aggregate notional amount of 1073 million interest rates ranging from 578 to 725 and expiration dates through november 2020 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreements relating to the 2011 credit facility the 2012 credit facility and the 2012 term loan the loan agreements for the 2011 credit facility the 2012 credit facility and the 2012 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below where we designate 

  

certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

  

  

 the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for the credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to the securitization  the loan agreement related to the securitization involves assets related to 5295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the “borrowers” through a private offering of 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 the “certificates” as of december 31 2012 5278 broadcast and wireless communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries 

the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent 

  

directors the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations 

under the terms of the securitization loan agreement the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan on a monthly basis all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan referred to as excess cash flow is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us during the year ended december 31 2012 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately 5768 million 

in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage “dscr” for this purpose dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding 12 months on the securitization loan pursuant to one such test if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were 175x or less the “cash trap dscr” then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

additionally while the anticipated repayment date is not until april 2014 excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “amortization period” under the securitization loan until april 2014 an “amortization period” would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 145x the “minimum dscr” 

in such a case all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters and so would not be available for distribution to us 

consequently a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers additionally a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions pay reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program in addition if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 

as of december 31 2012 the borrowers’ dscr was 389x based on the borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2012 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding 12 months on the securitization loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 2113 million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr and approximately 2409 million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to 

  

raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under the caption “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets asset retirement obligations accounting for acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2012 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 

 we monitor our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the asset’s carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

  

 goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized 

during the year ended december 31 2012 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin except for two reporting units whose fair value exceed the carrying value by approximately 872 million for these two reporting units we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions 

 

 the goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated 419 million as of december 31 2012 and is the result of recently completed acquisitions accordingly the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due in part to the timing of the underlying acquisitionss current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business 

 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 66 million during the year ended december 31 2012 the change in 2012 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

  

  

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 51 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 

 

   

  

  

 accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate at december 31 2011 we reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit activities as a result of a reduction of the expected tax rate as a reit we will not pay federal income tax on our qrss because a dividends paid deduction will be available to offset our taxable income additionally we will be permitted to use nols to offset our reit taxable income we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income 

we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2012 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 956 million on deferred tax assets for certain of our subsidiaries which primarily relates to foreign nols we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax asset primarily our foreign and federal nols related to other trs entities as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these nols during the applicable carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

the recoverability of our us federal net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider an adjustment to our valuation allowances 

  

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 13 million as of december 31 2012 we have classified approximately 343 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 287 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2012 

we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately 101 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the united states should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states

 as of december 31 2012 we held ten interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which had an aggregate notional amount of 1073 million interest rates ranging from 578 to 725 and expiration dates through november 2020 

changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 was comprised of 2650 million under the 2011 credit facility 9920 million under the 2012 credit facility 7500 million under the 2012 term loan 610 million under the uganda loan 485 million under the south african facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in south africa and 191 million under the colombian longterm credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in colombia a 10 increase in current interest rates would result in an additional 48 million of interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity and as a component of comprehensive income loss we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations 

for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 30 of our revenues and approximately 39 of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies as compared to 26 and 34 respectively during the same period in 2011 

we have performed sensitivity analyses assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 and 2011 as of december 31 2012 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 5 as of december 31 2011 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 4 

as of december 31 2012 we have incurred a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt which is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being of longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse 

  

change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately 1888 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2012

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company that owns operates and develops communications sites our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 we also offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012 

our communications site portfolio includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system “das” networks which are collocation solutions to support seamless inbuilding and outdoor wireless coverage our portfolio consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2011 approximately 21320 towers domestically and approximately 23900 towers internationally in addition our portfolio also includes approximately 260 das networks that we operate in malls casinos and other inbuilding applications and select outdoor environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators under approximately 1810 communications sites 

american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications site portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development 

american tower corporation is a holding company and we conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist primarily of our operations in brazil chile colombia ghana india mexico peru and south africa in addition as previously disclosed we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire communications sites in uganda and subject to customary closing conditions we expect to close on the initial tranches of communications sites during the first half of 2012 

our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

in may 2011 we announced our intention to reorganize to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes which we refer to as the “reit conversion” as part of the reit conversion effective december 31 2011 we completed the merger with our predecessor that was approved by our stockholders in november 2011 at the time of the merger all outstanding shares of our class a common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation accordingly references herein to our “common stock” refer to our common stock and the class a common stock of our predecessor as applicable 

  

we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” a trs is a subsidiary of a reit that is subject to applicable corporate income tax our use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings the nonreit qualified businesses that we hold through trss include our network development services segment in addition we have included our international operations and das networks business within our trss in the future we may elect to reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations such as our international operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qualified reit subsidiaries 

as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing towers however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from all or a portion of our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 

as a reit we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income our reit taxable income typically will not include income earned by our trss except to the extent the trss pay dividends prior to the reit conversion we operated as a c corporation a reit is not permitted to retain earnings and profits accumulated during the years it was taxed as a c corporation or accumulated by its trss that have been converted to qualified reit subsidiaries and must make one or more distributions to stockholders that equal or exceed those accumulated amounts in december 2011 we paid a onetime special cash distribution “prereit distribution” to our stockholders of approximately 1378 million or 035 per share of common stock 

we intend to commence paying regular distributions in 2012 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions however will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors many of which are beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—due to the longterm expectations of revenue growth from tenant leases we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

das networks rooftop management and property interests in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate das networks provide communications site management services to third parties and manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites 

 

  

  

 network development services 

through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 2 2 and 3 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness as well as providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

  

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices as well as the expanding infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to increase the leasing of our existing communications site portfolio invest in and selectively grow our communications site portfolio further improve upon our operational performance and maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and maximize our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure 

 

  

  

  

 capital allocation strategy 

as a reit we must distribute an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income to stockholders the objective of our discretionary capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase recurring free cash flow per share and our return on invested capital to achieve this we expect to continue to deploy our discretionary capital after our reit distributions through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and acquisitions in addition we intend to return our remaining excess discretionary capital if any to stockholders through continuing our stock repurchase program or declaring special distributions from time to time during 2011 we generated approximately 12 billion of cash provided by operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 34 billion of investments including approximately 5230 million of capital expenditures 23207 million of acquisitions 

  

and 4374 million of stock repurchases including commissions and fees in december 2011 we also distributed approximately 1378 million to stockholders in connection with the prereit distribution 

 

  

  

 international expansion strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by establishing an independent wireless infrastructure leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international expansion opportunities where we expect our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved our international expansion strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses 

 

  

  

 growth and expansion 

in 2011 we continued to focus on growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions including expansion into new and existing international geographic areas and new site development consistent with our international expansion strategy during the year ended december 31 2011 we grew our communications site portfolio through the acquisition and construction of approximately 10430 towers the acquisition of approximately 2150 property interests the installation of approximately 40 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 680 shared generators on our sites in addition we continue to 

  

evaluate complementary services such as providing high capacity fiber backhaul lines to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business 

united states  during 2011 in response to the needs of our tenants we pursued the acquisition and construction of communications sites in select locations throughout the united states our expansion in the united states during 2011 included the acquisition and construction of approximately 430 towers the acquisition of approximately 2150 property interests the installation of approximately 40 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 680 shared generators on our sites 

international  during 2011 we expanded our international footprint as we acquired and constructed approximately 3230 communications sites in two new countries ghana and south africa our expansion during 2011 also included the acquisition and construction of approximately 6770 communications sites in our existing markets in brazil chile colombia india and mexico in december 2011 we announced the launch of operations in uganda and our entry into a definitive agreement for the establishment of a joint venture with mtn group limited subject to customary closing conditions we expect to close on the initial tranches of communications sites in uganda and additional tranches of communications sites in colombia and mexico during the first half of 2012 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 73 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and painted lighted and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders 

furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license “ipi” issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority “nca” which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers 

our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recently recommended to the department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of restrictions or limitations on foreign ownership certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose certain permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary but typically require tower owners andor our tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower 

  

construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

in addition our tenants both domestic and international may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may materially and adversely affect the demand for communications sites 

environmental matters our domestic and international operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or waste certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we also may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances and devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states before constructing a new tower or adding a new antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition 

our rental and management segments compete with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp and sba communications corporation wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers viom networks and gtl and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price and quality of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers 

  

telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ internal staffs we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

customer demand 

our strategy is predicated on our belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites 

 

  

  

  

  

 as these factors continue to grow as a competitive necessity in the united states on a widespread basis wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

  

  

  

 we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate access to their markets and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our wireless infrastructure business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends 

our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain 

  

complementary network technologies such as femtocells and wifi could offload a portion of our tenants’ network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which could also reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or permit equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our communications sites 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed 2122 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

furthermore the demand for broadcast space in the united states and mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our tenants consolidate merge or share site infrastructure with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites because certain portions of these tenants’ networks may be redundant for example in the us recently combined companies have either rationalized or announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites we would expect a similar outcome in india if the anticipated consolidation of certain tenants occurs in addition certain combined companies have undergone or are currently undergoing a modernization of their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our communications sites 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce obtainable lease rates examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants’ network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells and wifi could offload a portion of our tenants’ network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which could also reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of wireless 

  

communication radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space in addition a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our expansion initiatives may disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations assets and personnel 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel in a timely and efficient manner integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes potential cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition the integration of businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel 

furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel and the other risks described below in “—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” as a result our foreign operations and expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which would substantially reduce funds available 

we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 if we fail to qualify as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply we believe that we are organized and will qualify as a reit upon timely filing our federal income tax return for 2012 and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot guarantee that we will qualify or remain so qualified including if our board of directors determines it is no longer in our interests to be a reit this is because reit qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the code provisions 

if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code 

 

  

  

 any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment would be reduced 

  

we could suffer adverse tax or other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business and we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future moreover the internal revenue service “irs” and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a reit or with respect to our trss in which case either we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties if any or we will offset additional income as determined by a tax authority with our nols if we offset such additional income with our nols our required distributions to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit will increase and we may be required to pay deficiency dividends and an associated interest charge if our prior reit distributions were insufficient in light of the reduced available nols 

in addition domestic and international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge if there are tax benefits that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or use our nols or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities all of which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure to make required distributions would subject us to additional federal corporate income tax which may limit our ability to fund these distributions using cash generated through our trss 

we intend to declare regular distributions commencing in 2012 the amount of which will be determined and is subject to adjustment by our board of directors if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and may fail to qualify for taxation as a reit which generally requires distribution of an amount equal to at least 90 of reit taxable income in addition our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible expenditures such as capital expenditures payments of compensation for which section 162m of the code denies a deduction the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments 

to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code 

our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our communications sites and rentalrelated services consequently no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income thus our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders specifically if our trss become highly profitable we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability 

in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements 

  

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located 

we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 35 on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period generally ten years after the reit conversion up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2012 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis as of january 1 2012 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability we cannot however assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 

complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy we could also be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments and could be limited in our ability to hedge liabilities and risks furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing in addition we may receive pressure from investors not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive 

under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our das networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through trss to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to fund these distributions even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings 

our extensive use of trss in particular for our international operations may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25 of the fair market value of our assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit 

  

we have no experience operating as a reit which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we have only been operating as a reit since january 1 2012 accordingly the experience of our senior management operating a reit is limited our prereit operating experience may not be sufficient to operate successfully as a reit failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 26 of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations compared to 19 for the year ended december 31 2010 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will grow in the future accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action or withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments which could require us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture 

we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would have a negative impact on our reported revenues operating profits and income 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction of communications sites in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants for the year ended december 31 2011 four tenants accounted for approximately 74 of our domestic rental and management segment revenue and five tenants accounted for approximately 53 of our international rental and management segment revenue if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships including our renegotiation of our agreement with one of our largest international tenants iusacell however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

due to the longterm expectations of revenue growth from tenant leases we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage in the past we have had tenants that have filed for bankruptcy in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures downturns in the economy and disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectable accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset in addition it could result in the loss of significant tenants and all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 87 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2011 are located on land we lease but do not own approximately 78 of the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2021 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

to fund capital expenditures fund future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities sell assets or raise equity we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2012 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures required distribution payments and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2012 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings additionally a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us 

in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short and longterm debt to sell assets or to offer equity securities furthermore the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 72 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 16 billion under our credit facilities our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 

  

our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our business results results of operations or financial condition including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreements related to our securitization transaction the loan agreements for our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreement related to our securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers subject to the securitization transaction and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan the servicer on the loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction in which case we could lose such towers and the excess cash flow associated with such towers 

the loan agreements for our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and could thus limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our indentures restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we would be subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the 

  

required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do 

competitive pricing for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated 

our communications site portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we would lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur goodwill and other intangible impairment charges which may require us to record a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we are required to assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles annually to determine if they are impaired or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment these circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income a significant adverse change in the business climate a decline in market capitalization or slower growth rates in our industry among others if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made 

while we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2011 it is possible that in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill for our reporting units or for other intangible assets these charges could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

distributions payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 

certain distributions payable by corporations to individuals trusts and estates that are us stockholders are currently eligible for federal income tax at a minimum rate of 15 and are scheduled to be taxed at ordinary income rates for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 distributions payable by reits in contrast generally are not eligible for the current reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of nonreit corporations that pay distributions which could reduce the demand and market price of shares of our common stock 

we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third party sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our towers or data centers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen damage any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers as a result of these or other events would impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and could materially and adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but such insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the damage if we are unable to provide services to our tenants as a result of damage to our towers it could lead to customer loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated 

  

lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact the market for wireless services as well as our tenants which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on june 2 2011 we received a subpoena from the sec requesting certain documents from 2007 through the date of the subpoena including in particular documents related to our tax accounting and reporting while we believe this investigation may in part relate to a former employee’s complaints received in the past which we previously investigated with the assistance of outside counsel and a forensic accounting firm finding no material issues we cannot at this time predict the scope or the outcome of this investigation we understand that our independent registered public accounting firm and one of our consultants have also received subpoenas primarily related to our tax accounting and reporting during this period and our investigation into this complaint we have cooperated and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the sec with respect to its investigation 

on june 3 2010 horseshoe capital “horseshoe” a company formed under the laws of the republic of mauritius filed a complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county with respect to horseshoe’s sale of xcel telecom private limited “xcel” to american tower mauritius “at mauritius” our wholly owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the republic of mauritius the complaint named at mauritius american towers llc and us as defendants and the dispute concerned the timing and amount of distributions to be made by at mauritius to horseshoe from a 75 million holdback escrow account and a 157 million tax escrow account each established by the transaction agreements at closing the complaint sought release of the entire holdback escrow account plus an additional 28 million as well as the release of approximately 120 million of the tax escrow account the complaint also sought punitive damages in excess of 690 million we filed an answer to the complaint in august 2010 disputing both the amounts alleged to be owed under the escrow agreements as well as the timing of the escrow distributions we also asserted in our answer that the demand for punitive damages was meritless the parties filed crossmotions for summary judgment concerning the release of the tax escrow account and in january 2011 the court granted our motion for summary judgment finding no obligation for us to release the disputed portion of the tax escrow until 2013 in march 2011 horseshoe filed a motion for summary judgment seeking disbursement of 53 million of the holdback escrow account that it claimed is undisputed the court denied horseshoe’s motion in may 2011 in august 2011 we entered into a settlement agreement with horseshoe pursuant to which i 73 million from the holdback escrow account was distributed to horseshoe and the remainder to us ii no funds were distributed from the tax escrow and iii horseshoe released all of its claims against us the case was dismissed in september 2011 

one of our subsidiaries spectrasite communications inc “sci” is involved in a lawsuit brought in mexico against a former mexican subsidiary of sci the subsidiary of sci was sold in 2002 prior to our merger with sci’s parent in 2005 the lawsuit concerns a terminated tower construction contract and related agreements with a wireless carrier in mexico the primary issue for us is whether sci itself can be found liable to the mexican carrier the trial and lower appellate courts initially found that sci had no such liability in part because mexican courts do not have the necessary jurisdiction over sci in september 2010 following several decisions by mexican appellate courts including the supreme court of mexico and related appeals by both parties an intermediate appellate court issued a new decision that would if enforceable reimpose liability on sci in its decision the intermediate appellate court identified potential damages in the form of potential statutory interest of approximately 67 million as of that date on october 14 2010 we filed a new 

  

constitutional appeal to again dispute the decision which was rejected on january 24 2012 the case will be returned to the trial court to determine whether any actual damages should be awarded to the mexican carrier by the primary defendant in the case or sci any judgment of the court in mexico against sci would need to be enforced in the united states as a result at this stage of the proceeding we are unable to determine whether the trial court in mexico will assess damages against sci and whether any such damages would be enforceable in the united states 

we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel other than the legal proceedings discussed above and in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report there are no matters currently pending that would in the event of an adverse outcome have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

executive overview 

our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we also manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 and include our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012 

the following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of december 31 2011 

 

   

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2011 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2011 will generate approximately 185 billion of noncancellable future tenant lease revenue absent the impact of straightline lease accounting in addition most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual rent escalations are typically annual and based on a fixed percentage on average approximately 35 in the us inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straightline basis over the noncancellable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants which increases the noncancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues 

the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically may not be cancelled or in some instances may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee accordingly revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2011 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2 of our rental and management operations revenues 

rental and management operations revenue growth  the primary factors affecting the consistent revenue and incremental growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period “new sites” and organic revenue growth which consists of 

 

  

  

 we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth in addition we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our return on investment criteria 

rental and management operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth 

 

   

 in addition wireless service providers in the united states continue to pursue new avenues for growth such as deploying 4g technology based wireless networks to provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as wireless service providers begin to deploy 4g wireless networks we expect them to overlay 4g equipment across their existing networks of communications sites resulting in additional revenue subsequent to the initial deployment and based on actual subscriber demand we expect providers to add additional equipment and new communications sites to improve the coverage and capacity of their 4g wireless networks as subscribers transition from 3g handsets in connection with consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment this technology migration has historically provided consistent demand for our communications sites as our tenants migrate from one technology to the next to remain competitive 

 

 rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2011 we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of approximately 10470 sites in addition in 2011 we also acquired property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators under approximately 1810 communications sites we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 

 

  

 network development services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

  

rental and management operations expenses our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our customers these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in general our rental and management segment level selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint we may incur additional segment level selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in these areas our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

reit conversion  effective january 1 2012 we reorganized our operations to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes the reit tax rules require that we derive most of our income other than income generated by a trs from investments in real estate which for us will primarily consist of income from the leasing of our communications sites 

a reit is not permitted to retain earnings and profits accumulated either during the years it was taxed as a c corporation or by its trss that have been converted to qualified reit subsidiaries and must make one or more distributions to stockholders that equal or exceed that accumulated amount in december 2011 we paid the prereit distribution to our stockholders of approximately 1378 million we intend to commence paying regular distributions in 2012 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions however will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors many of which are beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

for more information on the requirements to qualify as a reit see item 1 of this annual report under the caption “business—overview” and item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—failure to make required distributions would subject us to additional federal corporate income tax which may limit our ability to fund these distributions using cash generated through our trss” and “—certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities” 

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations net income loss from equity method investments income tax provision benefit other income expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating expenses depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 it is the primary measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 it is widely used in the 

  

tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature and 5 it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of longterm strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company such as decisions with respect to capital structure capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure has been included below

unison notes in connection with the unison acquisition on october 14 2011 we assumed 1960 million of existing indebtedness under three separate classes of secured cellular site revenue notes the “unison notes” issued by unison ground lease funding llc the “unison issuer” in a securitization transaction the “unison securitization” the three classes of unison notes bear interest at rates of 5349 6392 and 9522 respectively with anticipated repayment dates of april 15 2017 april 15 2020 and april 15 2020 respectively and a final maturity date of april 15 2040 the unison issuer may prepay the unison notes in whole or in part at any time following may 6 2012 provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration if the prepayment occurs within six months of the anticipated repayment date no prepayment consideration is due 

the unison notes are secured by among other things liens on approximately 1470 real property interests owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the unison issuer and other related assets 

  

under the terms of the indenture for the unison notes the “unison indenture” the unison notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the property interests subject to the unison securitization the unison issuer is required to make monthly payments of interest to holders of the unison notes on a monthly basis cash flows in excess of amounts needed to make debt service payments and other payments required under the unison indenture are to be distributed to the unison issuer which may then be distributed to and used by us excess cash flows distributed to the unison issuer and potentially to us are not expected to be material 

as of december 31 2011 we had 1960 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the unison notes which at the time of acquisition had a 133 million premium recorded as a result of fair value adjustments recognized upon the unison acquisition 

stock repurchase programs in february 2008 our board of directors approved the 2008 buyback pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase 15 billion of common stock in july 2011 we ceased making repurchases under the 2008 buyback and we do not expect to make any additional repurchases under the 2008 buyback in the future in march 2011 our board of directors approved the 2011 buyback pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional 15 billion of common stock 

during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 81 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 4239 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the stock repurchase programs as of december 31 2011 we had repurchased 345 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of 14116 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 buyback and 34 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of 1812 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2011 buyback 

between january 1 2012 and february 6 2012 we repurchased an additional 37900 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 23 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2011 buyback as a result as of february 6 2012 we had repurchased a total of approximately 35 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 buyback for an aggregate of 1835 million including commissions and fees 

under each program we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors to facilitate repurchases we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under rule 10b51 of the exchange act which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods 

we expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining 13 billion under the 2011 buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors in the near term we expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities purchases under each program are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases 

sales of equity securities we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans for the year ended december 31 2011 we received an aggregate of 856 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercises of stock options 

dividends we declared and paid the prereit distribution of approximately 1378 million to our stockholders in december 2011 no dividends were declared in the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

  

contractual obligations our contractual obligations relate primarily to the commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 issued in our securitization transaction borrowings under our credit facilities our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of december 31 2011 in thousands 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

interest rate swap agreements  as of december 31 2011 we have no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as all interest swaps matured during the year as of december 31 2010 we held 12 interest rate swap agreements all of which had been designated as cash flow hedges and which had an aggregate notional amount of 5250 million interest rates ranging from 286 to 374 and expiration dates through march 2011 on january 16 2012 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the variability in the forecasted interest payments on 50 of the amount outstanding under the south african facility 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2011 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

  

restrictions under loan agreements relating to revolving credit facility term loan and 2011 credit facility the loan agreements for the revolving credit facility term loan and 2011 credit facility contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below where we designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

  

  

 on january 31 2012 we entered into the 2012 credit facility the loan agreement for the 2012 credit facility contains financial ratios and operating covenants that are substantially similar to those in the 2011 credit facility including the three financial tests described above also on january 31 2012 we repaid the revolving credit facility and term loan with 6250 million of proceeds from the 2011 credit facility and 7000 million of proceeds from the 2012 credit facility upon repayment we terminated the revolving credit facility 

the loan agreements for the 2011 credit facility and 2012 credit facility also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for the 2011 credit facility and 2012 credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow 

  

additional funds under the facilities but would constitute a default which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the 2011 credit facility and 2012 credit facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to our securitization transaction  the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction the “securitization” involved assets related to 5295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the “borrowers” through a private offering of 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 the “certificates” as of december 31 2011 5285 broadcast and communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries 

the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations 

under the terms of the securitization loan agreement the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan on a monthly basis all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan referred to as excess cash flow is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us during the year ended december 31 2011 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately 4971 million 

in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage “dscr” for this purpose dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan pursuant to one such test if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were 

 

  

 then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

additionally while we do not anticipate commencing principal payments with respect to any component of the securitization loan until april 2014 excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “amortization period” under the securitization loan until april 2014 an “amortization period” would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 

 

  

   

in such a case all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters and so would not be available for distribution to us 

consequently a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers additionally a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions pay reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program in addition if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 

as of december 31 2011 the borrowers’ dscr was 360x based on the borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2011 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 2273 million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr and approximately 2421 million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth expansion initiatives refinance our existing indebtedness satisfy our reit distribution requirements or fund our stock repurchase program 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under the caption “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets including goodwill asset retirement obligations acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2011 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 

  

in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 

 we monitor our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the asset’s carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

 

 goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test we employ a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized 

during the year ended december 31 2011 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin except for two reporting units whose fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 106 million for these two reporting units we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions 

 

 the goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated 889 million as of december 31 2011 and is the result of recently completed acquisitions accordingly the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due in part to the timing of the underlying acquisitions current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the 

  

planned amounts due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business 

 

 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 708 million during the year ended december 31 2011 and an increase of 33 million during the year ended december 31 2010 the change in 2011 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 

  

   

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 53 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectability of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts which were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and reserves for amounts invoiced whose collectability is not reasonably assured 

 

  

  

   

accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate at december 31 2011 we have reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit activities because we began operating as a reit effective january 1 2012 we will generally not pay federal income tax at the reit level including our qualified reit subsidiaries but instead a dividends paid deduction will offset our taxable income as a result while we will still be permitted to use nols and tax credit carryforwards to offset our reit taxable income we do not expect to pay taxes on our reit taxable income and therefore do not expect to be able to realize such deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2011 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 58 million which primarily relates to foreign nols we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily our foreign and federal nols related to our trs entities as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal nols during the applicable carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 70 million in federal for trs entities and state taxable income respectively from january 1 2012 to december 31 2031 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider a valuation allowance 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 3 million as of december 31 2011 we have classified approximately 366 million as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 315 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 

  

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2011 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenuegenerating activities this guidance requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence of selling price for deliverables this guidance was effective for any contracts entered into or materially modified by us on or after january 1 2011 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

in june 2011 the fasb issued amendments to the requirements for presentation of comprehensive income this guidance effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 early adoption is permitted requires presentation of total comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to this guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented this guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we early adopted the amended guidance requiring presentation of comprehensive income in two consecutive financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 the implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

accounting standards updates 

in may 2011 the fasb amended its guidance related to fair value measurement and disclosure this guidance clarifies existing measurement and disclosure requirements and results in greater consistency between gaap and international financial reporting standards this guidance will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 the implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment that will become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted under the new guidance an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the implementation of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our total variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 was comprised of 10 billion under the revolving credit facility and 3250 million under the term loan a 10 increase in current interest rates would have caused an additional pretax charge to our net income and an immaterial increase in our cash outflows for the year ended december 31 2011 variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements was comprised of 500 million under the revolving credit facility and 500 million under the term loan a 10 increase in thencurrent interest rates would have caused an additional pretax charge to our net income and an immaterial increase to our cash outflows for the year ended december 31 2010 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in stockholders’ equity and as a component of comprehensive income we may enter into foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations 

for the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 26 of our revenues and approximately 34 of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies as compared to 19 and 24 respectively during the same period in 2010 

we have performed sensitivity analyses assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2011 and 2010 as of december 31 2011 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 4 as of december 31 2010 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our revenue operating results or cash flows 

as of december 31 2011 we had a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being of longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances entered into in 2011 would have resulted in approximately 1135 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other expense income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2011

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company that owns operates and develops communications sites our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 we also offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

our communications site portfolio includes wireless communications towers broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system “das” networks which are collocation solutions to support seamless inbuilding and outdoor wireless coverage our portfolio consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2010 approximately 20900 towers domestically and approximately 13900 towers internationally our portfolio also includes approximately 200 inbuilding and outdoor das networks that we operate in malls casinos and other inbuilding applications and select outdoor environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners 

american tower corporation was created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications site portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements development and construction of sites and through mergers with and acquisitions of other tower operators 

american tower corporation is a holding company and we conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers inc “ati” and spectrasite communications llc “spectrasite” we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries our international operations consist primarily of our operations in brazil chile colombia india mexico and peru in addition as previously disclosed we have entered into definitive agreements to acquire communications sites in south africa and ghana and subject to customary closing conditions we expect to close on initial tranches of communications sites during the first half of 2011 

increased expansion activity in international markets and changes to our organizational structure have led us to separately disclose our rental and management operations in two reportable segments domestic rental and management and international rental and management through our network development services segment we also offer towerrelated services domestically accordingly our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

products and services 

rental and management operations 

our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98 97 and 97 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our tenants lease space on our 

  

communications site infrastructure where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases and the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon various factors including but not limited to tower location amount of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent property taxes and repairs and maintenance which are primarily fixed with annual cost escalations in our international markets a portion of our operating costs is passed through to our tenants such as ground rent and fuel costs our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics 

 

  

  

  

  

 our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enable us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 79 82 and 83 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our international rental and management segment which is comprised primarily of communications sites in brazil chile colombia india mexico and peru provides a source of diversification and growth our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 19 15 and 14 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless communications towers broadcast communications towers and das networks as well as rooftop management 

wireless communications towers we own and operate wireless communications towers in the united states brazil chile colombia india mexico and peru approximately 93 94 and 92 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our wireless towers for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

we lease space on our wireless communications towers to tenants in a diverse range of wireless services including personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio wimax paging and fixed microwave our four largest domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows 

 

  

 accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—due to the longterm expectations of revenue growth from tenant leases we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” 

broadcast communications towers das networks and rooftop management in addition to our wireless communications towers we also own and operate broadcast towers and das networks and provide communications site management services to third parties 

 

  

  

 network development services 

through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 2 3 and 3 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our 

  

tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site under applicable law 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing cycle times as well as provide opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

strategy 

operational strategy 

our operational strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets as well as the expanding infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to increase the leasing of our existing communications site portfolio invest in and selectively grow our communications site portfolio further improve upon our operational performance and maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and maximize our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure 

 

  

  

  

   

capital allocation strategy 

the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase recurring free cash flow per share growth and our return on invested capital to achieve this we expect we will continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program and acquisitions while continuing our stock repurchase program or implementing a dividend program to the extent we determine it necessary or appropriate during 2010 we generated approximately 10 billion of cash provided by operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 17 billion of investments which included approximately 3467 million of capital expenditures 8996 million of acquisitions and 4208 million of stock repurchases including commissions and fees 

 

  

  

 international expansion strategy 

we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by establishing an independent wireless infrastructure leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international expansion opportunities where our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved our international expansion strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation whereby we conduct the following analyses 

 

  

  

   

demand drivers 

our strategy is predicated on our belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites 

 

  

  

  

  

 as these factors continue to grow as a competitive necessity in the united states on a widespread basis wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage 

 

  

  

  

 we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality and coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet this demand we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate access to their markets and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site service and development capabilities 

recent developments 

growth and expansion 

in 2010 we continued to focus on growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions and new site development including expansion into new and existing international geographic areas during the year ended december 31 2010 we grew our communications site portfolio through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7800 towers and the installation of approximately 30 inbuilding and outdoor das networks in addition we continue to evaluate complementary product lines such as shared generators to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy we also continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our portfolio 

  

united states  during 2010 in response to the needs of our tenants we pursued the acquisition and construction of communications sites in select locations throughout the united states our expansion in the united states during 2010 included the acquisition and construction of approximately 900 towers and the installation of approximately 30 inbuilding and outdoor das networks 

international  during 2010 we increased our footprint in latin america primarily through the acquisition and construction of approximately 1700 towers in brazil chile colombia mexico and peru during 2010 we also expanded our presence in india through the acquisition of essar telecom infrastructure private limited “etipl” adding over 4600 towers to our communications site portfolio we also constructed approximately 500 towers in india as previously disclosed in 2010 we entered into definitive agreements to acquire communications sites in brazil chile colombia ghana and south africa subject to customary closing conditions 

financing transactions 

in 2010 we continued to raise capital to refinance our outstanding indebtedness and fund acquisitions in august and december of 2010 we completed registered public offerings of 7000 million aggregate principal amount of our 505 senior notes due 2020 “505 notes” and 10 billion aggregate principal amount of our 450 senior notes due 2018 “450 notes” 

for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and notes 6 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas our domestic and international tower operations are subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 81 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and painted lighted and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries such as the ministry of civil aviation in india and the ministry of transportation and telecommunications in chile noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties 

furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license “ipi” issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over our infrastructure in the case of emergency or war 

in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor our tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction and the addition of new 

  

antennas to a site existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 limits state and local zoning authorities by prohibiting any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations 

in addition our tenants both domestic and international may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may materially and adversely affect the demand for communications sites 

environmental matters our domestic and international operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or waste certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination we and our customers may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances and devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions 

additionally in the united states before constructing a new tower or adding a new antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure 

competition and customer demand 

rental and management segments 

our rental and management segments compete with other international national and regional tower companies primarily crown castle international corp and sba communications corporation in the united states and indus towers in india as well as wireless carriers and broadcasters that own and operate their own communications site networks and lease space to third parties numerous independent tower owners and the owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price and quality of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

customer demand is also affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies technologies that make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks could reduce customer demand for our communications sites the increased use of spectrally efficient air access technologies which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells could offload a portion of network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which could reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

  

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers also could adversely affect customer demand for leasing tower space these arrangements which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements enable a provider to adequately serve its tenants outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or swap their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our communications sites 

network development services segment 

our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our domestic and international rental and management and network development services segments 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we employed 1729 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

many of the factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

furthermore the demand for broadcast space in the united states and mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if our tenants consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our tenants may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites because certain portions of these tenants’ networks may be redundant and a reduction in future capital expenditures in the aggregate because these tenants’ expansion plans may be similar for example in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel in the united states and of iusacell celular and unefon now under the common ownership of grupo iusacell in mexico the combined companies either rationalized or have announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites we would expect a similar outcome in india if the anticipated consolidation of certain tenants occurs in addition 

  

certain combined companies have undergone or are currently undergoing a modernization of their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated and our ongoing contractual revenues would be reduced as a result similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing on our communications sites 

new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant’s business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services have the effect of decreasing demand for tower space or reduce obtainable lease rates examples of such technologies include spectrally efficient air access technologies which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems and could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells could offload a portion of network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which would reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of wireless communication radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our antenna space the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenant’s business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our expansion initiatives may disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations assets and personnel 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel in a timely and efficient manner integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes potential cultural differences and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition the integration of businesses may significantly burden management and our internal resources 

furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel as well as those risks described below in “—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” although we generally focus our international efforts in countries with relatively stable political and macroeconomic environments we are subject to several factors outside our control and our expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could suffer adverse tax or other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business and we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe 

  

our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge if there are tax benefits that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to utilize our net operating losses we may be required to make significant payments or adjustments 

we have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and the tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after the applicable nols are used or expire we may be limited in our ability to utilize nols obtained through acquisitions 

to the extent we believe that a nol is not more likely than not to be utilized we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol our ability to utilize our nols is dependent upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our valuation allowances for our nols periodically and make adjustments as needed which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could materially limit our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or the use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state nols we are actively considering an election to a reit for us federal and where applicable state income tax purposes we may make the determination to elect reit status for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 as early as the second half of 2011 subject to the approval of our board of directors although there is no certainty as to the timing of a reit election or whether we will make a reit election at all if we elect reit status and we fail to qualify as a reit for any tax year after such election is effective and certain relief provisions are not available to us or we choose not to do so or revoke or otherwise terminate such election we would be taxed as a regular corporation and may be subject to a higher cash tax burden which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

due to the longterm expectations of revenue growth from tenant leases we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage in the past we have had tenants that have filed for bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures and the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment on our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset customer relationship intangible asset or customer base intangible asset in addition it could result in the loss of significant tenants and all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues 

  

from certain tenants all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example as discussed below in “—risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers” iusacell has been engaged in a refinancing of a majority of its us dollar denominated debt 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 19 of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will grow in the future accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities 

in addition we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in the respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would have a negative impact on our reported revenues and operating profits which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we anticipate that we may need additional financing to fund future growth and expansion initiatives to refinance our existing indebtedness and to fund our stock repurchase program 

in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives refinance our existing indebtedness and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2011 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2011 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund growth initiatives and to support additional return of capital to stockholders if so depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings additionally a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us 

  

from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our future growth and expansion initiatives refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers for the year ended december 31 2010 four customers accounted for approximately 74 of our domestic rental and management segment revenue and four customers accounted for approximately 58 of our international rental and management segment revenue if any of these customers is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases although we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our customer relationships it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with customers or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our largest international customer is iusacell which is the brand name under which a group of companies controlled by grupo iusacell sa de cv “grupo iusacell” operates iusacell represented approximately 4 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 grupo iusacell has been engaged in a refinancing of a majority of its us dollar denominated debt and in connection with this process two of the legal entities of the group including grupo iusacell voluntarily filed for a prepackaged concurso mercantil a process substantially equivalent to chapter 11 of us bankruptcy law with the backing of a majority of their financial creditors in december 2010 as of december 31 2010 iusacell notes receivable net and related assets which include financing lease commitments and a deferred rent asset that are primarily longterm in nature were 197 million and 512 million respectively if grupo iusacell is unable to restructure its us dollar denominated debt it may not be able to meet its operating obligations including making payments to us in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do 

competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our tenants is subject to federal state local and foreign regulation in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively local zoning authorities and 

  

community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands and requirements existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for more information regarding the regulations we are subject to please see item 1 of this annual report under the caption “regulatory matters” 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated 

as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report our communications site portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of such towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs and our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues approximately 85 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2010 are located on land we lease but do not own approximately 86 of the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2020 and beyond our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 56 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 9177 million under our 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our revolving credit facility obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would increase our total leverage 

our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreement related to our securitization the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and the indentures governing our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreement related to our securitization includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the loan agreement for the securitization are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers subject to the securitization and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan the servicer on the loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose such towers and the revenue associated with such towers 

the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and the additional 3250 million of term loan commitments “term loan” contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and thus require that we limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness paying dividends or other distributions to shareholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our indentures restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we could have liability under environmental laws 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to 

  

hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third party sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our towers or data centers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen damage any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers as a result of these or other events would impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and could materially and adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but such insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the damage if we are unable to provide services to our tenants as a result of damage to our towers it could lead to customer loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact the market for wireless services as well as our tenants which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters

one of our subsidiaries spectrasite communications inc “sci” is involved in a lawsuit brought in mexico against a former mexican subsidiary of sci the subsidiary of sci was sold in 2002 prior to our merger with sci’s parent in 2005 the lawsuit concerns a terminated tower construction contract and related agreements with a wireless carrier in mexico the primary issue for us is whether sci itself can be found liable to the mexican carrier the trial and lower appellate courts initially found that sci had no such liability in part because mexican courts do not have the necessary jurisdiction over sci following several decisions by mexican appellate courts including the supreme court of mexico and related appeals by both parties an intermediate appellate court issued a new decision that would if enforceable reimpose liability on sci in september 2010 in its decision the intermediate appellate court identified potential damages of approximately 67 million and on october 14 2010 we filed a new constitutional appeal to again dispute the decision as a result at this stage of the proceeding we are unable to determine whether the liability imposed on sci by the september 2010 decision will survive or to estimate our share if any of that potential liability if the decision survives the pending appeal

executive overview 

our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 increased expansion activity in international markets and changes to our organizational structure have led us to separately disclose our rental and management operations in two reportable segments domestic rental and management and international rental and management through our network development services segment we also offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites accordingly our continuing operations are now reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services 

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of december 2010 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 135 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue absent the impact of straightline lease accounting in addition most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual rent escalations are typically annual and based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straightline basis over the noncancellable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our tenants which increases the noncancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues 

the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically may not be cancelled or in some instances may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee accordingly revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their 

  

terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2010 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 3 of our rental and management operations revenues 

rental and management operations revenue growth  the primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for our domestic and international rental and management segments are 

 

  

  

  

 we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth in addition we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our return on investment criteria 

rental and management operations organic revenue growth  consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and to a lesser extent the location of and available capacity on our existing sites this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth 

 

 in addition wireless service providers in the united states continue to pursue new avenues for growth such as deploying 4g technology based wireless networks to provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as wireless service providers begin to deploy 4g wireless networks we expect them to overlay 4g equipment across their existing networks of communications sites resulting in additional revenue subsequent to the initial deployment and based on actual subscriber demand we expect providers to add additional equipment and new communications sites to improve the coverage and capacity of their 4g wireless networks as subscribers transition from 3g handsets in connection with consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment this technology migration path has historically provided consistent demand for our communications sites as our tenants migrate their networks from one technology to the next to remain competitive 

  

 rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2010 we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7800 sites we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios both domestically and internationally that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio 

 

  

 network development services segment revenue growth  as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

rental and management operations expenses our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance and utilities these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in general our rental and management segment level selling general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint we may incur additional segment level selling general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

reit election  as we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state nols we are actively considering an election to a reit for us federal and where applicable state income tax purposes we may make the determination to elect reit status for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 as early as the second half of 2011 subject to the approval of our board of directors although there is no certainty as to the timing of a reit election or whether we will make a reit election at all 

  

nongaap financial measures 

included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted “adjusted ebitda” we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss from discontinued operations net income from equity method investments income tax provision benefit other income expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating expenses depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense 

adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is the primary measure used by our management team when evaluating the performance of our operating segments it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants and it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 

our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure has been included below

redemption of ati 725 senior subordinated notes —during the year ended december 31 2010 ati issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining 03 million aggregate principal amount of its 725 senior subordinated notes due 2011 “ati 725 notes” in accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the ati 725 notes the remaining ati 725 notes were redeemed at a price equal to 10000 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding september 23 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of 03 million upon completion of this redemption none of the ati 725 notes remained outstanding 

interest rate swap agreements  as of december 31 2010 we held 12 interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which have an aggregate notional amount of 5250 million interest rates ranging from 286 to 374 and expiration dates through march 2011 as of december 31 2009 we held 13 interest rate swaps which had an aggregate notional amount of 6250 million to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under our revolving credit facility and term loan during the year ended december 31 2010 one of the contracts matured 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2010 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to revolving credit facility and term loan the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guarantees sales of assets and liens the loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with 

  

which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

  

  

 the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility but would constitute a default which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to securitization  the loan agreement related to the securitization involved assets related to 5295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the “borrowers” through a private offering of 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 the “certificates” the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization 

  

loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations 

under the terms of the securitization loan agreement the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan on a monthly basis all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan referred to as excess cash flow is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us during the year ended december 31 2010 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately 4440 million 

in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage “dscr” for this purpose dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan pursuant to one such test if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were 

 

  

 then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

additionally while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the securitization loan until april 2014 excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “amortization period” under the securitization loan until april 2014 an “amortization period” would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 

 

  

 in such a case all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters and so would not be available for distribution to us 

consequently a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers additionally a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions and our stock repurchase program in addition if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 

as of december 31 2010 the borrowers’ dscr was 334x based on the borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2010 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 2010 million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr and approximately 2158 million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 

  

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under the caption “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and consequently a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets including goodwill asset retirement obligations acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2010 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

 

 we monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the customer related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customer related intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the 

  

asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the asset’s carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

 

 all of our goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test we employ a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results the current weighted average cost of capital and a current tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized 

during the year ended december 31 2010 no impairment was determined under the first step of the test as the fair value of the respective reporting units is substantially in excess of their carrying values we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions 

 

  

  

 during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 33 million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 22 million respectively the increase in 2010 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset 

  

retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 

  

 we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of customers in the telecommunications industry and approximately 59 of our revenues are derived from four customers in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and customers in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectability of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on management’s estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts which were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments and reserves for amounts invoiced whose collectability is not reasonably assured 

 

   

  

  

 we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2010 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 482 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards equity investments and foreign items we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twentyyear tax carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 03 billion and 04 billion in federal and state taxable income respectively from january 1 2011 to december 31 2030 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 

we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination 

  

which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 

we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 30 million as of december 31 2010 we have classified approximately 260 million as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 180 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2010 

accounting standards updates 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenuegenerating activities this guidance allows companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence of selling price for deliverables this guidance is effective for any contracts entered into or materially modified after january 1 2011 we do not anticipate this update will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

 changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements was comprised of 500 million under the revolving credit facility and 500 under the term loan a 10 increase or 31 basis points in current interest rates would have caused an additional pretax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of 03 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in stockholders’ equity and as a component of comprehensive income 

for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 19 of our total revenues and approximately 24 of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies as compared to 15 and 19 respectively during the same period in 2009 

  

we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our revenue operating results or cash flows

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 in making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control—integrated framework  based on this assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2010 our internal control over financial reporting is effective

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company that develops owns and operates communications sites including wireless communications towers broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system “das” networks our portfolio of wireless and broadcast towers consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2009 approximately 20000 towers in the united states and approximately 7000 towers in mexico brazil and india our portfolio also includes approximately 200 inbuilding das networks that we operate in malls casinos and other inbuilding applications in the united states and mexico and one outdoor das network in development in the united states in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners in the united states mexico and brazil 

our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies this segment of our business which we refer to as our rental and management segment accounted for approximately 97 97 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively through our network development services segment we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which directly support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

we have historically focused on our rental and management segment due to its high operating leverage and low cash flow volatility when compared to our network development services segment our rental and management segment has generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and cash flows due to the following characteristics 

 

  

  

  

 additionally our communications site portfolio provides us with growth potential because we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites in the united states our largest geographic area our nationwide network of communications sites enables us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging wireless service providers our diverse site portfolio and our established customer base provide us with a diverse source of new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable revenue growth our operations in the united states accounted for approximately 85 86 and 87 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our international site leasing business which is comprised of communications sites in mexico brazil and india provides a source of diversification and growth for our rental and management segment our international site leasing business accounted for approximately 15 14 and 13 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in developing our international site portfolio we have focused on building and acquiring communications sites in high demand areas to meet the needs of our customers 

  

strategy 

our strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the expanding infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies we believe that based on current trends wireless service providers in each of our existing geographic areas will continue to invest in their networks to meet demand from their new and existing subscribers wireless communications services have experienced significant growth in our domestic and international businesses 

wireless service growth 

 

 according to industry data in the united states total voice minutes of use increased to over 11 trillion for the six months ended june 30 2009 representing a yearoveryear increase from the prior year period of approximately 3 further as of june 30 2009 revenue attributable to data services increased from the prior year period to over 27 as a percent of total service revenues for the nationwide wireless service providers to meet the needs of growing voice and data service usage cell sites in the industry ie the number of antenna arrays and related equipment in commercial operation not the number of towers on which that equipment is located increased to approximately 245900 as of june 30 2009 representing a yearoveryear increase from the prior year period of 12 

we believe the growth in the number of wireless service subscribers the minutes of use per subscriber and the further adoption of wireless data applications by subscribers will require wireless carriers to add new cell sites and new equipment to existing cell sites to maintain the performance of their networks in the areas they currently cover and to extend service to areas where coverage does not yet exist as wireless carriers continue to add subscribers and seek to limit churn we anticipate they will focus on network quality as a competitive necessity and will continue to invest in equipment upgrades that increase the capacity and overall quality of their networks 

in addition we believe that as the usage of wireless data applications such as email internet access and video continues to grow on a widespread basis wireless carriers may be compelled to further increase the cell density of their existing networks deploy new technology and equipment and expand their network coverage to meet this demand we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate access to their markets and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site service and development capabilities 

we believe that our existing portfolio of communications sites our towerrelated services and our management team position us to benefit from these trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters the key elements of our strategy include 

 

   

  

  

 the company 

american tower corporation was created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 to own manage develop and lease communications and broadcast tower sites and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications site portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements development and construction and through mergers with and acquisitions of other tower operators increasing the size of our portfolio to over 27200 communications sites 

american tower corporation is a holding company and we conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries our principal united states operating subsidiaries are american towers inc “ati” and spectrasite communications llc “spectrasite” we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries our international operations consist of our operations in mexico brazil and india 

we operate in two business segments rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

products and services 

rental and management segment 

our primary business is our communications site leasing business which we conduct through our rental and management segment this segment accounted for approximately 97 97 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our rental and management segment is comprised of our domestic and international site leasing business including the operation of wireless communications towers broadcast communications towers and das networks as well as rooftop management 

wireless communications towers we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the united states mexico and brazil based on number of towers and revenue we also own and operate communications towers in india where we commenced operations in the second half of 2007 in addition to owning wireless communications towers we also manage wireless communications sites for property owners in the united states mexico and brazil approximately 94 92 and 91 of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to our wireless towers for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as of december 31 2009 our wireless tower portfolio included the following 

 

 we lease space on our wireless communications towers to customers in a diverse range of wireless industries including personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio wimax paging and fixed microwave our three largest wireless customers by revenue in each country are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 for the year ended december 31 2009 we had three customers that each accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues att mobility sprint nextel and verizon wireless accounted for approximately 19 18 and 15 respectively of our 2009 total revenues approximately 61 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were derived from four customers as a result we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases we are sensitive to the credit worthiness of our tenants” and “a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position” 

our leases with wireless communications providers in the markets we serve generally have initial noncancelable terms of five to ten years in most cases our tenant leases have multiple fiveyear renewal terms 

  

at the option of the tenant wireless carriers generally renew their leases with us because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in an existing carrier’s network may be expensive and often requires reconfiguring several other sites within the carrier’s network which may impact the carrier’s network quality and coverage and may also require the carrier to obtain other governmental permits most of our tenant leases have escalation provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these automatic increases are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation 

annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon various factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the number of antenna arrays that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the tower’s location height and structural capacity at certain wind speeds as of december 31 2009 our towers had an average of approximately 24 tenants per tower we believe that a significant majority of our towers have the capacity to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants without the need to make capital investments to augment the structure we believe that nearly all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future leasing demand with relatively minor capital investment by strengthening its foundation increasing its height or reinforcing the steel crossbars in the united states a portion of these upgrade and augmentation costs are generally shared with the customer resulting in a short payback period for our net capital investment 

broadcast communications towers we are one of the largest independent owners and operators of broadcast towers in the united states and mexico we own approximately 230 broadcast towers in the united states and have exclusive rights to approximately 200 broadcast towers in mexico broadcast towers generally are taller and structurally more complex than wireless communications towers require unique engineering skills and are more costly to build we lease space on our broadcast towers to a variety of customers including wireless service providers but the higher elevations on these towers are primarily leased to radio and television broadcast companies in leasing tower space to radio and broadcast companies we generally receive monthly fees with initial noncancelable lease terms ranging from ten to twenty years for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 6 6 and 7 respectively of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to our broadcast communications towers 

das networks we provide inbuilding and outdoor das networks in the united states we own and operate approximately 200 inbuilding das networks in malls casinos and other inbuilding applications in the united states and mexico we obtain rights to install and operate inbuilding das networks by entering into contracts with property owners and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our inbuilding das networks for a fee under licenses that typically have an initial noncancelable term of at least ten years 

we offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our customers typically we design build and operate our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless structures similar to our inbuilding das 

  

networks our customer agreements for our outdoor das networks typically have an initial noncancelable term of at least ten years 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 1 of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to our das networks 

rooftop management we also provide management services to property owners in the united states mexico and brazil who own rooftops that are capable of hosting wireless communications equipment we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into contracts with property owners pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid by the wireless carriers and other tenants for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 1 of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to rooftop management 

network development services segment 

we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services through our network development services segment this segment accounted for approximately 3 3 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting services  we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on the behalf of our customers we typically work with our customers’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where a new tower site will best address the customers’ needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site under applicable law 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of communications equipment on towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if augmentation is needed which enables our customers to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing customers by among other things reducing cycle times related to tower structural analysis as well as provide opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

recent developments 

growth and expansion 

in 2009 we continued to focus on our strategy of growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions and new site development including expansion into new international geographic areas during the year ended december 31 2009 we grew our communications site portfolio through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of 3529 towers and the installation of 20 inbuilding and one outdoor das networks in addition we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our portfolio 

united states  during 2009 in response to the needs of our customers we pursued the acquisition and construction of communications sites in select locations throughout the united states our expansion in the united states during 2009 included the acquisition and construction of 507 towers and the installation of 21 inbuilding and outdoor das networks 

latin america  during 2009 the majority of our expansion efforts in latin america were focused in brazil as our customers sought to increase the density of their networks following a recent wireless spectrum auction our expansion in latin america during 2009 included the acquisition and construction of 578 towers 

  

asia  during 2009 we expanded our presence and increased our footprint in india through the acquisitions of xcel telecom private limited “xcel” and insight infrastructure pte ltd “insight” as well as the construction of new communications sites in 2009 we acquired and constructed 2444 towers 

financing transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we improved our financial position by raising capital to refinance and repurchase a portion of our outstanding indebtedness which increased our flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant transactions included those set forth below 

senior notes offerings in june and october of 2009 we completed institutional private placements of 3000 million aggregate principal amount of our 725 senior unsecured notes due 2019 “725 notes” and 6000 million aggregate principal amount of our 4625 senior unsecured notes due 2015 “4625 notes” respectively we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 725 notes to finance the repurchase and redemption of our outstanding 750 senior notes due 2012 “750 notes” and to repay certain of our indebtedness incurred under our 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit facility” we used the net proceeds from the offering of the 4625 notes primarily to finance the redemption of our outstanding 7125 senior notes due 2012 “7125 notes” 

repurchases and redemption of debt securities during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased or redeemed approximately 7251 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities including the repurchase and redemption of 2250 million principal amount of our 750 notes the redemption of 5000 million principal amount of our 7125 notes and the redemption of 01 million principal amount of our 300 convertible notes due august 15 2012 “300 notes” 

stock repurchase program in 2009 we continued to repurchase shares of our class a common stock “common stock” pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program in february 2008 our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to 15 billion of our common stock “2008 buyback” during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased 66 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 2147 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 buyback 

for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and notes 6 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the faa prior to use towers requiring faa approval must be registered with the fcc and must be painted and lighted in accordance with the faa’s standards tower owners are responsible for notifying the faa of any tower lighting outages or malfunctions and for timely repairing lighting outages or malfunctions tower owners also must notify the fcc when ownership of a tower changes we generally indemnify our customers against noncompliance with applicable standards noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties 

in all countries in which we own or operate towers we are subject to local zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials government agencies or 

  

community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower in the united states however the telecommunications act of 1996 limits state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of wireless communications towers the law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations the telecommunications act of 1996 also requires the federal government to help licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for towers 

local zoning authorities and community residents often are opposed to construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction and the addition of new antennas to a site existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which can increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our domestic and international construction activities and operations 

as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions in addition our customers in each country may also be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may materially and adversely affect the demand for communications sites and in some cases require relocation of certain sites 

environmental health and safety matters our domestic and international operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations at all levels of government including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers for example in india we are subject to the pollution control laws for the use of diesel generators at sites and these laws vary from state to state in the united states the fcc considers the construction of a new tower or the addition of a new antenna to an existing site including building rooftops and water towers to be a federal undertaking subject to prior environmental review and approval under the national environmental policy act of 1969 “nepa” which obligates federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of undertakings to determine whether they may significantly affect the environment the fcc has issued regulations implementing nepa as well as the national historic preservation act of 1966 and the endangered species act of 1973 these regulations obligate each fcc applicant or licensee to investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower or adding a new antenna to a site if a tower or new antenna would have a significant impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes at our sites or at sites to which we transported hazardous substances or wastes certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination 

our domestic and international operations are also subject to guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure and other occupational health and safety matters in the united states we are subject to the occupational safety and health act of 1970 and our field personnel are subject to regulation by the 

  

occupational safety and health administration “osha” and equivalent state agencies concerning such matters 

we and our customers may be required to obtain permits comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances used at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines andor criminal sanctions 

competition and customer demand 

rental and management segment 

our rental and management segment competes with other international national and regional tower companies such as crown castle international corp and sba communications corporation in the united states and indus towers in india as well as wireless carriers and broadcasters that own and operate their own communications site networks and lease space to third parties numerous independent tower owners and the owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity price and quality of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

customer demand is also affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies technologies that make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks could reduce customer demand for our communications sites the increased use of spectrally efficient airlink technologies which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells could offload a portion of network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which could reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers also could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements enable a provider to adequately serve its customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could have a similar impact on customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or swap their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our communications sites 

network development services segment 

our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our rental and management and network development services segments 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 1420 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

many of the factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the demand for broadcast space is dependent on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition as we continue to work with our customers during the transition from analogbased transmissions to digitalbased transmissions any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

furthermore any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could have an impact on consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless carrier customers could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites because certain portions of their networks may be redundant and a reduction in future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar for example in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel in the united states and of iusacell celular and unefon now under the common ownership of grupo iusacell in mexico the combined companies rationalized duplicative parts of their networks which has led to the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites in addition these and other customers could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these contracts are terminated and our ongoing contractual revenues would be reduced as a result similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing on our communications sites 

our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 42 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 6958 million under the revolving credit facility our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan the indentures governing our debt securities and the loan agreement related to our securitization could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and the additional 3250 million of term loan commitments “term loan” contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and thus require that we limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our indentures restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

the loan agreement related to our securitization includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the loan agreement for the securitization are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers subject to the securitization and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan the servicer on the loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose such towers and the revenue associated with such towers 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business and we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge if there are tax benefits that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition we have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases we are sensitive to the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage in the past we have had customers that have filed for bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues in addition many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures and the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant customers experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment on our deferred rent asset tower asset or customer relationship intangible asset in addition it could result in the loss of significant customers and all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example as discussed below in “—risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers” grupo iusacell suspended the debt service payment of its us dollar denominated debt to its bondholders and is currently in negotiations with those bondholders while grupo iusacell’s operating subsidiaries have continued to make partial payments to us our net accounts receivable related to grupo iusacell was approximately 282 million as of december 31 2009 

  

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates 

our business operations in mexico brazil and india and our expansion into any other international geographic areas in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 15 of our consolidated revenues were generated by our international operations we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts while most of the contracts for our operations in mexico are denominated in the us dollar many are denominated in the mexican peso and contracts for our operations in brazil and india are denominated in the local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would have a negative impact on our reported revenues and operating profits which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

  

  

  

   

our largest international customer is grupo iusacell which now controls both iusacell celular and unefon in mexico grupo iusacell is under common control with tv azteca grupo iusacell accounted for approximately 5 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 in addition for the year ended december 31 2009 we received 157 million in interest income from tv azteca on our net note receivable balance of 1082 million 

if any of these customers is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our agreements although we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our customer relationships it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our agreements with customers or a material modification of the terms of those agreements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

on april 1 2009 grupo iusacell announced that one of its subsidiaries had suspended the debt service payment of its us dollar denominated debt as part of an ongoing process to restructure its us dollar denominated debt which has been affected by the significant devaluation of the mexican peso versus the us dollar while grupo iusacell has continued to make partial payments to us our net accounts receivable related to grupo iusacell was approximately 282 million as of december 31 2009 we also have approximately 335 million of other grupo iusacell related assets as of december 31 2009 which includes financing lease commitments and accrued straightline revenue that are primarily longterm in nature if grupo iusacell is unable to restructure its indebtedness or if a further devaluation of the mexican peso were to adversely impact grupo iusacell’s overall liquidity grupo iusacell might not be able to meet its operating obligations including making full payments under the lease agreements with us in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we anticipate that we may need additional financing to fund future growth and expansion initiatives to refinance our existing indebtedness and to fund our stock repurchase program 

in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives refinance our existing indebtedness and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2010 will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2010 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund growth initiatives and to support additional return of capital to stockholders if so depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our stock repurchase program refinance our existing indebtedness or fund future growth and expansion initiatives 

new technologies could make our tower leasing business less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the use and need for towerbased wireless services transmission and reception and have 

  

the effect of decreasing demand for tower space examples of such technologies include spectrally efficient airlink technologies which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells could offload a portion of network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which would reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of wireless communication radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our antenna space the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could have liability under environmental laws 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of real property and facilities we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third party sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have accorded with all legal requirements many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our customers is subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including by the faa the fcc the us environmental protection agency and the osha both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting and the fcc separately regulates transmitting devices operating on towers similar regulations exist in mexico brazil india and other foreign countries regarding wireless communications and the operation of towers local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands and requirements existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do 

  

our competition includes 

 

  

  

  

 competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 83 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2009 are located on land we do not own approximately 89 of the ground agreements for these sites have a final expiration date of 2019 and beyond our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated 

our communications site portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers under these agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated for example our spectrasite subsidiary has entered into lease or sublease agreements with affiliates of sbc communications a predecessor entity to att mobility with respect to approximately 2500 towers pursuant to which spectrasite has the option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2013 the aggregate purchase option price for the att mobility towers was approximately 4130 million as of december 31 2009 and will accrete at a rate of 10 per year to the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site we have entered into a similar agreement with alltel which completed its merger with verizon wireless in january 2009 with respect to approximately 1800 towers for which we have an option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2016 the aggregate purchase option price for the alltel towers was approximately 633 million as of december 31 2009 and will accrete at a rate of 3 per year through the expiration of the lease or sublease period at alltel’s option at the expiration of the sublease period the purchase price would 

  

be payable in cash or with 769 shares of our common stock per tower we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these or other leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of such towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs and our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our towers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen damage any damage or destruction to our towers as a result of these or other risks would impact our ability to provide services to our customers and could materially and adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a future major event further we carry business interruption insurance but such insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the damage if we are unable to provide services to our customers as a result of damage to our towers it could lead to customer loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions posed health risks to consumers it could negatively impact the market for wireless services as well as our wireless carrier customers which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

our historical stock option granting practices are subject to ongoing governmental proceedings which could result in fines penalties or other liability 

in may 2006 we announced that our board of directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting subsequent to the formation of the special committee we received an informal letter of inquiry from the sec a subpoena from the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york and an information document request from the internal revenue service “irs” each requesting documents and information related to our stock option grants and practices we also received a request for information from the department of labor which concluded its review in september 2008 with no action taken against us we have cooperated with these governmental authorities to provide the requested documents and information these governmental proceedings are ongoing and the time period necessary to resolve these proceedings is uncertain and could require significant 

  

additional management and financial resources significant legal and accounting expenses related to these matters have been incurred to date and we may incur expenses in the future depending on the final outcomes of these proceedings we and members of our senior management could be subject to regulatory fines penalties enforcement actions or other liability which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition as a result of the special committee’s findings we restated our historical financial statements for certain periods prior to march 31 2006 to among other things record changes for stockbased compensation expense and related tax effects relating to certain past stock option grants

on may 26 2006 a purported securities class action was filed in united states district court for the district of massachusetts against us and certain of our current and former officers by john s greenebaum for monetary relief in march 2007 an amended consolidated complaint was filed naming certain of our current and former officers and directors of the company as defendants and alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws in connection with public statements made relating to our stock option practices and related accounting the complaint asserted claims under sections 10b and 20a of the exchange act and sec rule 10b5 in february 2008 the court preliminarily approved a settlement we had reached with the plaintiffs the settlement provided for a payment by us of 140 million and led to a dismissal of all claims against all defendants in the litigation in march and april of 2008 we paid the settlement amount in may 2008 the original plaintiff mr greenebaum filed an objection to the settlement which was dismissed by the court in june and july of 2008 the court approved the settlement and denied a request by mr greenebaum to optout of the settlement class certified by the court mr greenebaum appealed the decision of the court relating to him and in december 2008 we entered 

  

into a settlement agreement with mr greenebaum providing for payment by us of 5000 which the court approved in january 2009 in january 2009 the plaintiff’s class entered into a settlement agreement with mr greenebaum as a result of these settlements mr greenebaum withdrew his appeals effectively ending the litigation 

on may 24 2006 and june 14 2006 two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in suffolk county superior court in massachusetts by eric johnston and robert l garber respectively the lawsuits were filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment in connection with our historical stock option granting practices the lawsuits also named us as a nominal defendant the lawsuits sought to recover the damages sustained by us and disgorgement of all profits received with respect to the alleged backdated stock options in october 2007 the court dismissed the complaint without leave to amend due to the plaintiffs’ failure to make a demand upon our board of directors before initiating their lawsuits in december 2007 the plaintiffs filed an appeal of that decision to the massachusetts court of appeals in june 2008 the massachusetts supreme judicial court elected on its own motion to hear the appeal and in april 2009 affirmed the judgment dismissing the complaint without leave to amend the plaintiffs’ right to initiate a new claim based on the response to the demand made at the time of dismissal expired in july 2009

one of our subsidiaries spectrasite communications inc “sci” is involved in a lawsuit brought in mexico against a former mexican subsidiary of sci the subsidiary of sci was sold in 2002 prior to our merger with sci’s parent in 2005 the lawsuit concerns a terminated tower construction contract and related agreements with a wireless carrier in mexico the primary issue for us is whether sci itself can be found liable to the mexican carrier the trial and lower appellate courts initially found that sci had no such liability in part because mexican courts do not have full jurisdiction over sci these decisions were appealed by the plaintiff and in july 2008 they were reversed by an intermediate mexican appellate court in its decision the intermediate appellate court identified potential damages of approximately 230 million sci appealed that ruling to a higher constitutional court in mexico in january 2009 the constitutional court ruled in sci’s favor remanding the case back to the intermediate appellate court for further proceedings in march 2009 the intermediate appellate court issued its decision which reasserts jurisdiction and reimposes liability on sci in april 2009 as permitted under mexican law sci filed an appeal of this decision to the higher constitutional court on the grounds that the decision of the intermediate appellate court is inconsistent with the january 2009 ruling of the higher constitutional court and mexican law in august 2009 the plaintiff filed a petition with the supreme court of mexico asking the court to rule on sci’s appeal to the constitutional court in september 2009 the supreme court refused to hear the appeal as a result the case remains pending in the constitutional court and we are unable to estimate our share if any of potential liability at this stage of the proceedings

our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues and approximately 99 of our segment operating profit for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period “legacy sites” new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period “new sites” our existing tenant leases and related contractual escalations leasing of additional space on our existing sites and the cancellation rate of our existing tenant leases we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing site capacity in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services as we continue to primarily focus on growing our rental and management business we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial noncancelable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december 2009 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods in addition most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual escalations are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers which increases the noncancelable term of the agreement and creates incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows 

the revenues generated by our rental and management segment may also be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters 

  

are multiyear contracts which typically may not be cancelled or in some instances may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee accordingly lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment during the year ended december 31 2009 tenant leases representing approximately 2 of our rental and management revenues were cancelled 

during the year ended december 31 2009 revenues generated by our rental and management segment increased 1214 million from the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated by our legacy sites which resulted from leasing additional space to new tenants leasing additional space for the equipment of our existing tenants as well as contractual tenant lease escalations to a lesser extent a portion of our revenue growth was attributable to the 4511 new sites that we acquired or constructed since january 1 2008 the increase in revenue was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a reduction in straightline revenue recognition 

our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and to a lesser extent the location of and available capacity on our existing sites this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital and general economic conditions we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites and expanding our site portfolio will contribute to the majority of our yearoveryear revenue growth in 2010 

our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance and utilities these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense our segment level selling general administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments such as sales and property management functions in general our segment level selling general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our legacy sites and increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new customers on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint we may incur additional segment level selling general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities

interest rate swap agreements  as of december 31 2009 we held 13 interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which have an aggregate notional amount of 6250 million interest rates ranging from 286 to 408 and expiration dates through march 2011 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2009 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to revolving credit facility and term loan the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with each of these covenants 

 

  

  

   

the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants 

any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility but would constitute a default which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to securitization  the loan agreement related to the securitization involved assets related to 5295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the “borrowers” through a private offering of 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 the “certificates” the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations 

under the terms of the securitization loan agreement the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan on a monthly basis all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan referred to as excess cash flow is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us during the year ended december 31 2009 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately 4474 million 

in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage “dscr” for this purpose dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan pursuant to one such test if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were 

 

  

 then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 

  

additionally while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the securitization loan until april 2014 excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “amortization period” under the securitization loan until april 2014 an “amortization period” would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 

 

  

 in such a case all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters and so would not be available for distribution to us 

consequently a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers additionally a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions and our stock repurchase program in addition if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 

as of december 31 2009 the borrowers’ dscr was 310x based on the borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2009 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the securitization loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 1775 million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr and approximately 1923 million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 

as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 

in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under the caption “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and consequently a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity as also set forth in that item as of december 31 2009 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have primarily caused a subsidiary of grupo iusacell which represented approximately 5 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 to suspend debt service payments on its us dollar denominated debt while grupo iusacell has continued to make partial payments to us our net accounts receivable related to grupo iusacell was approximately 282 million as of december 31 2009 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related 

  

disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets asset retirement obligations revenue recognition stockbased compensation income taxes and estimated useful lives of assets management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2009 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result for a discussion of our other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning on page f7 

 

  

 all of our goodwill is recorded in our rental and management segment and tested for impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we utilize the two step traditional impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test we employ a discounted cash flow analysis corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate management’s expectations of future operating results the current weighted average cost of capital and a current tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value as calculated using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the rental and management reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the rental and management reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized 

during the year ended december 31 2009 no impairment was determined under the first step of the test we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none 

  

of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions a 15 reduction in projected net income a 200 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital and a 15 reduction in terminal sales growth rate 

 

 during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 189 million and 130 million respectively the increase in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 

  

  

 we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable 

  

statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 10 million as of december 31 2009 we have classified approximately 165 million as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 152 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 

we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2009 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 478 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards equity investments and foreign items we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twentyyear tax carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 09 billion and 09 billion in federal and state taxable income respectively from january 1 2010 to december 31 2029 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations 

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2009

 item 1 business tableend overview 

we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company with a portfolio of over 23700 communications sites including wireless communications towers broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system “das” networks our portfolio of wireless and broadcast tower sites consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2008 approximately 19600 sites in the united states and approximately 4000 sites in mexico brazil and india our portfolio also includes approximately 170 das networks that we operate in malls casinos and other inbuilding applications in the united states and mexico in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners in the united states mexico and brazil 

our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies this segment of our business which we refer to as our rental and management segment accounted for approximately 97 98 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively through our network development services segment we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which directly support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

we have historically focused on our rental and management segment due to its significant operating leverage and low cash flow volatility when compared to our network development services segment our rental and management segment has generated stable revenue and cash flows due to the following characteristics 

 

  

  

  

 additionally our communications site portfolio provides us with growth potential because we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites in the united states our largest market our nationwide network of communications sites enables us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging wireless service providers our broad site portfolio and our large customer base provide us with a diverse source of new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable revenue growth our operations in the united states accounted for approximately 86 87 and 87 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

our international site leasing business which is comprised of communications sites in mexico brazil and india provides a further source of diversification and growth for our rental and management segment our international site leasing business accounted for approximately 14 13 and 13 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively in developing our international site portfolio we have focused on building and acquiring communications sites in high demand areas to meet the needs of our customers 

  

strategy 

our strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the infrastructure requirements necessary to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies we believe that based on current trends wireless service providers in each of our existing markets will continue to invest in their networks to meet demand from their new and existing subscribers wireless communications services have experienced significant growth in our domestic and international markets 

united states wireless growth 

 

  

  

 international wireless growth 

 

  

  

 we believe the growth in the number of wireless service subscribers the minutes of use per subscriber and the further adoption of wireless data applications by subscribers will require wireless carriers to add new cell sites and new equipment to existing cell sites to maintain the performance of their networks in the areas they currently cover and to extend service to areas where coverage does not yet exist as wireless carriers continue to add subscribers and seek to limit churn we also anticipate they will focus on network quality as a competitive necessity and will continue to invest in upgrades that increase the capacity of their networks in addition we believe that as wireless data applications such as email internet access and video are adopted on a widespread basis wireless carriers may be compelled to further increase the cell density of their existing networks deploy new technology and equipment and expand their network coverage to meet this demand we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means of accelerating access to their markets and more efficiently using their capital rather than constructing and operating their own communications sites and maintaining their own communications site service and development capabilities 

we believe that our existing portfolio of communications sites our towerrelated services offerings and our management team position us to benefit from these trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters the key elements of our strategy include 

 

   

  

  

  

 the company 

american tower corporation was created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 to own manage develop and lease communications and broadcast tower sites and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications site portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements development and construction and through mergers with and acquisitions of other tower operators increasing the size of our portfolio to over 23700 communications sites 

american tower corporation is a holding company and we conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries our principal united states operating subsidiaries are american towers inc 

  

“ati” and spectrasite communications llc “spectrasite” we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries our international operations consist primarily of our operations in mexico and brazil and also include operations in india which we established in the second half of 2007 

we operate in two business segments rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

products and services 

rental and management 

our primary business is our communications site leasing business which we conduct through our rental and management segment this segment accounted for approximately 97 98 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our rental and management segment is comprised of our domestic and international site leasing business including the operation of wireless communications towers broadcast communications towers and das networks as well as rooftop management 

wireless communications towers we are a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the united states mexico and brazil based on number of towers and revenue we also own and operate communications towers in india where we commenced operations in the second half of 2007 in addition to owned wireless communications towers we also manage wireless communications sites for property owners in the united states mexico and brazil approximately 92 91 and 91 of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to our wireless communications towers for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as of december 31 2008 our wireless communications tower portfolio included the following 

 

 we lease space on our wireless communications towers to customers in a diverse range of wireless industries including personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio wimax paging and fixed microwave our major domestic wireless customers include att mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless which completed its merger with alltel in january 2009 and tmobile usa our major international wireless customers include grupo iusacell iusacell celular and unefon in mexico nextel international in mexico and brazil telefonica movistar in mexico and vivo in brazil america movil telcel in mexico and claro in brazil and telecom italia mobile tim in brazil for the year ended december 31 

  

2008 we had three customers that each accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues att mobility sprint nextel and verizon wireless including alltel accounted for approximately 20 19 and 16 respectively of our 2008 total revenues approximately 68 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 were derived from six customers as a result we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers” and “—due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the credit worthiness of its tenants” in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption “risk factors—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position” 

our leases with wireless communications providers in the united states generally have initial noncancelable terms of five to ten years in mexico brazil and india our tenant leases typically have an initial noncancelable term of ten years in most cases our tenant leases have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant wireless carriers generally renew their leases with us because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in an existing carrier’s network is expensive and often requires reconfiguring several other sites within the carrier’s network which may impact the carrier’s network quality and coverage and may also require the carrier to obtain other governmental permits most of our tenant leases have escalation provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these automatic increases are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation 

annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the number of antenna arrays that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the tower’s location height and structural capacity at certain wind speeds as of december 31 2008 our tower sites had an average of approximately 25 tenants per tower we believe that a significant majority of our tower sites have the capacity to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants without the need to make capital investments to augment the structure we believe that nearly all of our tower sites that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future leasing demand with only minor capital costs a portion of these upgrade and augmentation costs are generally shared with the customer resulting in a short payback period for our net capital investment 

broadcast communications towers we are one of the largest independent owners and operators of broadcast towers in the united states and mexico we own over 200 broadcast towers in the united states and have exclusive rights to approximately 200 in mexico broadcast towers generally are taller and structurally more complex than wireless communications towers require unique engineering skills and are more costly to build we lease space on our broadcast towers primarily to radio and television broadcast companies in leasing tower space we generally receive monthly fees from customers with initial noncancelable lease terms ranging from ten to twenty years for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 6 7 and 7 respectively of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to our broadcast communications towers 

  

das networks we are a leading provider of inbuilding neutral host das networks in the united states with approximately 170 das networks in operation in malls casinos and other inbuilding applications we also own and operate a limited number of inbuilding das networks in mexico we obtain rights to install and operate inbuilding das networks by entering into contracts with property owners and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our inbuilding das networks for a fee under licenses that typically have an initial noncancelable term of at least ten years in 2007 we commenced offering outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our customers for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 1 of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to our das networks 

rooftop management we also provide management services to property owners in the united states mexico and brazil who own rooftops that are capable of hosting wireless communications equipment we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into contracts with property owners pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid by the wireless carriers and other tenants for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 1 of our rental and management segment revenue was attributable to rooftop management 

network development services 

we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services through our network development services segment this segment accounted for approximately 3 2 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

site acquisition zoning and permitting services  we engage in site acquisition services for our own account in connection with our tower development projects as well as for our customers we typically work with our customers’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where the customer needs to construct a new tower site to address its coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site under applicable law 

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of communications equipment on towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if augmentation is needed which enables our customers to better assess potential tower sites before making an installation decision in january 2007 we acquired a structural analysis engineering firm to increase our structural analysis capabilities we believe that this acquisition enables us to provide higher quality service to our existing customers by among other things reducing cycle times related to tower structural analysis as well as provide opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties 

recent developments 

growth and expansion 

in 2008 we continued to focus on our strategy of growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions and new site development including through expansion into new international markets during the year ended december 31 2008 we grew our communications site portfolio through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition of 269 towers for an aggregate purchase price of 428 million and the construction of 676 towers and the installation of 16 inbuilding das networks for an aggregate cost of 907 million the majority of our new construction activities were in our international markets primarily in brazil and india during 2008 we continued to seek out opportunities to expand our operations in our existing international markets as well as into other countries that meet our criteria for international expansion and we expect to continue these efforts in 2009 in addition we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger 

  

communications site portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our portfolio accordingly we intend to continue to assess and seek out opportunities for additional growth in 2009 

financing transactions 

in 2008 we improved our financial position by raising capital to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and by taking steps to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under our convertible notes which increased our flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant transactions included the following 

credit facilities in 2008 we increased our borrowing capacity under our 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility “revolving credit facility” by adding 3250 million of term loan commitments “term loan” we used the net proceeds from the term loan together with available cash to repay 3250 million of existing indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 

conversions of convertible notes in 2008 we reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of notes into shares of our class a common stock “common stock” holders of approximately 2011 million face amount of our outstanding convertible debt securities converted their notes into shares of our common stock including conversions of 183 million principal amount of our 325 convertible notes due august 15 2012 “325 notes” and 1828 million principal amount of our 300 convertible notes due august 15 2012 “300 notes” 

stock repurchase programs in 2008 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase programs in february 2008 we ended our 15 billion stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in february 2007 pursuant to which we repurchased a total of 353 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of 145 billion including commissions and fees in february 2008 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional 15 billion of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 183 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 6971 million including commissions and fees pursuant to our repurchase programs 

for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and notes 6 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

regulatory matters 

towers and antennas both the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting these regulations govern the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the faa towers requiring faa approval must be registered with the fcc and must be painted and lighted in accordance with the faa’s standards the faa review and the fcc registration processes are prerequisites to use of the tower by fcc licensees as well as our other customers tower owners are responsible for notifying the faa of any tower lighting outages or malfunctions and for timely repairing lighting outages or malfunctions tower owners also must notify the fcc when ownership of a tower changes we generally indemnify our customers against noncompliance with applicable standards noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties 

the fcc considers the construction of a new tower or the addition of a new antenna to an existing site including building rooftops and water towers to be a federal undertaking subject to prior environmental review and approval under the national environmental policy act of 1969 “nepa” which obligates federal agencies 

  

to evaluate the environmental impacts of undertakings to determine whether they may significantly affect the environment the fcc has issued regulations implementing nepa as well as the national historic preservation act and the endangered species act these regulations obligate each fcc applicant or licensee to investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower or adding a new antenna to a site if a tower or new antenna may have a significant impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by limiting state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of wireless communications towers the law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations the telecommunications act of 1996 also requires the federal government to help licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for towers 

we are subject to local and county zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often are opposed to construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction and the addition of new antennas to a site existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could adversely affect our construction activities and operations 

our tower operations in mexico brazil and india are also subject to regulation as we expand our operations into additional international markets we will be subject to regulations in additional foreign jurisdictions in addition our customers both domestic and foreign also may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may adversely affect the demand for communications sites 

environmental matters our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under those laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination 

we and our customers also may be required to obtain permits comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances used at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines andor criminal sanctions 

in november 2005 we entered into a facilities audit agreement with the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to the epa’s voluntary audit and disclosure policy pursuant to the facilities audit agreement we audited the tower sites in our portfolio as of july 2005 ie legacy american 

  

tower sites but not spectrasite sites for compliance with the notice and recordkeeping requirements under the emergency protection and community right to know act “epcra” the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act the facilities audit agreement provided for stipulated penalties for violations under epcra in november 2008 we paid a penalty of approximately 35000 under the facilities audit agreement which satisfied our obligations under the agreement 

health and safety we are subject to the occupational safety and health act and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure our field personnel are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration “osha” and equivalent state agencies concerning health and safety matters 

competition and customer demand 

rental and management 

our rental and management segment competes with other international national and regional tower companies such as crown castle international corp and sba communications corporation as well as wireless carriers and broadcasters that own and operate their own communications site networks and lease space to third parties numerous independent tower owners and the owners of noncommunications tower sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity price and quality of service have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

customer demand is also affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies technologies that make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks could reduce customer demand for our communications sites the increased use of spectrally efficient airlink technologies such as lowerrate vocoders which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells could offload a portion of network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which could reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites 

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing or roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers also could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements enable a provider to serve customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could have a similar impact on customer demand for our tower sites because the existing networks of several wireless carriers overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or swap their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our tower sites 

network development services 

our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions on network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our rental and management and network development services segments 

  

employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

many of the factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the demand for broadcast tower space is dependent on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition our broadcast tower division 

  

could be adversely affected as a result of the shift from analogbased transmissions to digitalbased transmissions which is scheduled to commence in 2009 

in addition the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets could have an impact on consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless carrier customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could adversely affect demand for our tower sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites because certain portions of their networks may be redundant and a reduction in future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their expansion plans may be similar for example in connection with the recent combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel in the united states and of iusacell celular and unefon now under the common ownership of grupo iusacell in mexico the combined companies have or are considering rationalizing their duplicative networks which has led and may continue to lead to the decommissioning of certain communications sites in addition these and other customers could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these contracts are terminated and our ongoing contractual revenues would be reduced as a result similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing space on our communications sites 

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 43 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 4951 million under the revolving credit facility our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness in addition we may draw down the revolving credit facility which has the effect of increasing our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan the indentures governing our debt securities and the loan agreement related to our securitization transaction could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and the indentures governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests these covenants and requirements limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition the loan agreement related to our securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things our subsidiaries that are borrowers under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers subject to the securitization transaction and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan the servicer on the loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction in which case we could lose such towers and the revenue associated with such towers 

in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity” and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future we apply the principles contained in fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 109” “fin 48” and we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will 

  

be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that we have recognized under fin 48 that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities we apply the principles contained in fin 48 to our nols and to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold of fin 48 we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our fin 48 position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the creditworthiness and financial strength of its tenants 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage in the past we have had customers that have filed for bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues in addition many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures and the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could adversely affect demand for our tower sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downtown or otherwise one or more of our significant customers experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment on our deferred rent asset in addition it could result in the loss of significant customers and anticipated lease revenues all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates 

our business operations in mexico brazil and india and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the 

  

united states for the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 14 of our consolidated revenues were generated by our international operations we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts while most of the contracts for our operations in mexico are denominated in the us dollar many are denominated in the mexican peso and contracts for our operations in brazil and india are denominated in the local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would have a negative impact on our revenues and operating profits which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers 

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

  

  

  

 our largest international customer is grupo iusacell which now controls both iusacell celular and unefon in mexico grupo iusacell is under common control with tv azteca grupo iusacell accounted for approximately 5 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 in addition for the year ended december 31 2008 we received 143 million in net interest income from tv azteca 

if any of these customers is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our agreements although we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our customer relationships it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our agreements with customers or a material modification of the terms of those agreements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the 

  

applicable customer could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we anticipate that we may need additional financing to fund our stock repurchase programs to refinance our existing indebtedness and to fund future growth and expansion initiatives 

in order to fund our stock repurchase programs refinance our existing indebtedness and fund future growth and expansion initiatives we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2009 will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2009 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund growth initiatives and to support additional return of capital to stockholders if so depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital such additional financing may be unavailable may be prohibitively expensive or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our stock repurchase programs refinance our existing indebtedness or fund future growth and expansion initiatives 

new technologies could make our tower leasing business less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues 

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the use and need for towerbased wireless services transmission and reception and have the effect of decreasing demand for tower space examples of such technologies include technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as lowerrate vocoders which can increase the capacity at existing sites and reduce the number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base additionally certain complementary network technologies such as femtocells could offload a portion of network traffic away from the traditional towerbased networks which would reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could adversely affect demand for our antenna space the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we could have liability under environmental laws 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as the owner lessee or operator of many thousands of real estate sites underlying our towers we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

our business and that of our customers is subject to federal state local and foreign regulation including by the faa the fcc the epa and osha both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting and the fcc separately regulates transmitting devices operating on towers similar regulations exist in mexico brazil india and other foreign countries regarding wireless communications and the operation of communications towers local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands and requirements existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations these factors could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors are in a weaker financial condition or may have lower return on investment criteria than we do 

our competition includes 

 

  

  

  

 competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 82 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2008 are located on land we do not own approximately 86 of the ground agreements for these sites have a final expiration date of 2018 and beyond our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on us 

  

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated 

our communications site portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers under these agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated for example our spectrasite subsidiary has entered into lease or sublease agreements with affiliates of sbc communications a predecessor entity to att mobility with respect to approximately 2500 towers pursuant to which spectrasite has the option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2013 the aggregate purchase option price for the att mobility towers was approximately 3754 million as of december 31 2008 and will accrete at a rate of 10 per year to the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site in addition we have entered into a similar agreement with alltel which completed its merger with verizon wireless in january 2009 with respect to approximately 1800 towers for which we have an option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2016 the aggregate purchase option price for the alltel towers was approximately 605 million as of december 31 2008 and will accrete at a rate of 3 per year through the expiration of the lease or sublease period at alltel’s option at the expiration of the sublease period the purchase price will be payable in cash or with 769 shares of our common stock per tower we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these or other leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of such towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our towers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen damage any damage or destruction to our towers as a result of these or other risks would impact our ability to provide services to our customers and could impact our results of operation and financial condition for example as a result of the severe hurricane activity in 2005 approximately 25 of our broadcast and wireless communications sites in the southeastern united states and mexico suffered material damage and many more suffered lesser damage while we maintain insurance that provided sufficient coverage for this incident we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a future major event further we carry business interruption insurance but such insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the damage if we are unable to provide services to our customers as a result of damage to our towers it could lead to customer loss resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been 

  

filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions posed health risks to consumers it could negatively impact the market for wireless services as well as our wireless carrier customers which would adversely affect our operations costs and revenues we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

our historical stock option granting practices are subject to ongoing governmental proceedings which could result in fines penalties or other liability 

in may 2006 we announced that our board of directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting subsequent to the formation of the special committee we received an informal letter of inquiry from the sec a subpoena from the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york and an information document request from the internal revenue service each requesting documents and information related to our stock option grants and practices we also received a request for information from the department of labor which concluded its review in september 2008 with no action taken against us we are cooperating with these governmental authorities to provide the requested documents and information these governmental proceedings are ongoing and the time period necessary to resolve these proceedings is uncertain and could require significant additional management and financial resources significant legal and accounting expenses related to these matters have been incurred to date and we may continue to incur expenses in the future depending on the outcomes of these proceedings we and members of our senior management could be subject to regulatory fines penalties enforcement actions or other liability which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition as a result of the special committee’s findings we restated our historical financial statements for certain periods prior to march 31 2006 to among other things record changes for stockbased compensation expense and related tax effects relating to certain past stock option grants 

pending civil litigation relating to our historical stock option granting practices exposes us to risks and uncertainties 

we and certain current and former directors and officers are defendants in a state consolidated shareholder derivative action relating to our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting this action was dismissed in october 2007 and that decision was appealed by the plaintiffs in june 2008 the massachusetts supreme judicial court elected on its own motion to hear the appeal which remains pending if the appeal is successful then the litigation could continue in this circumstance the outcome could not be predicted by us with certainty and is dependent upon many factors beyond our control if this action is successful however it could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition this matter and any other related lawsuits that may be filed could also result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding the litigation related to our historical stock option granting practices please see item 3 of this annual report under the caption “legal proceedings” and note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

 item 2 properties 

our principal offices are located in boston southborough and woburn massachusetts atlanta georgia cary north carolina mexico city mexico sao paulo brazil and delhi india details of each of these offices are provided below 

 

  

 in addition to the principal offices set forth above we maintain 13 regional area offices in the united states through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses we also have an international business development group based in london england we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs 

our interests in our communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests including leases created by longterm ground lease agreements easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities pursuant to the loan agreement for our securitization transaction the tower sites subject to the securitization are subject to mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan a typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site a tower structure and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting receiving and switching equipment there are three principal types of towers guyed selfsupporting lattice and monopole 

 

  

  

 of the approximately 23700 communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2008 approximately 82 are located on land we do not own ground agreements for land underlying our towers generally have an 

  

initial term of five years with three or four additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of twenty to twentyfive years as a result approximately 86 of the ground agreements for our sites have a final expiration date of 2018 and beyond 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on may 18 2006 we received a letter of informal inquiry from the sec division of enforcement requesting information related to our stock option grants and stock option practices the inquiry is focused on stock options granted to senior management and members of our board of directors during the period 1997 to 2006 we continue to cooperate with the sec to provide documents testimony and other information as requested we are aware that in february 2008 a former officer of the company received a “wells” notice from the sec which affords such individual the opportunity to make a submission to the sec with respect to contemplated civil enforcement recommendations against such individual for certain violations of the federal securities laws 

on may 19 2006 we received a subpoena from the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york for records and information relating to our stock option granting practices the subpoena requests materials related to certain stock options granted between 1995 and 2006 we continue to cooperate with the us attorney’s office to provide the requested information and documents 

on may 26 2006 a purported securities class action was filed in united states district court for the district of massachusetts against us and certain of our current officers by john s greenebaum for monetary relief specifically the complaint named us james d taiclet jr and bradley e singer as defendants and alleged that the defendants violated federal securities laws in connection with public statements made relating to our stock option practices and related accounting the complaint asserted claims under sections 10b and 20a of the exchange act and sec rule 10b5 in december 2006 the court appointed the steamship trade associationinternational longshoreman’s association pension fund as the lead plaintiff in march 2007 plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint which included additional current and former officers and directors of the company as defendants in december 2007 we announced that we had reached a settlement in principle regarding the securities class action the settlement which was preliminarily approved by the court in february 2008 provided for a payment by us of 140 million and would lead to a dismissal of all claims against all defendants in the litigation we paid 250000 of the settlement amount to an escrow account controlled by the plaintiffs during the quarter ended march 31 2008 in april 2008 we paid the remaining settlement amount of 138 million into escrow and received 125 million in insurance proceeds in may 2008 the original plaintiff mr greenebaum filed an objection to the settlement following a hearing in june 2008 the court dismissed mr greenebaum’s objection and finally approved the settlement in july 2008 mr greenebaum filed an untimely request to optout of the settlement class certified by the court in its orders which the court denied in august 2008 mr greenebaum filed a notice of appeal of the court’s final order approving the settlement agreement and of the court’s decision denying his untimely request to opt out of the settlement class in december 2008 we entered into a settlement agreement with mr greenebaum providing for payment by us of 5000 which the court approved in january 2009 in january 2009 the lead plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with mr greenebaum as a result of these settlements mr greenebaum withdrew his appeals effectively ending the litigation 

on may 24 2006 and june 14 2006 two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in suffolk county superior court in massachusetts by eric johnston and robert l garber respectively the lawsuits were filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment in connection with our historical stock option granting practices the lawsuits also named us as a nominal defendant the lawsuits sought to recover the damages sustained by us and disgorgement of all profits received with respect to the alleged backdated stock options in october 2006 these two lawsuits were consolidated and in october 2007 the court dismissed the complaint without leave to amend due to the plaintiffs’ failure to make a demand upon our board of directors before initiating their lawsuits in december 2007 the plaintiffs filed an appeal of that decision to the massachusetts court of appeals which we are 

  

opposing and in april 2008 we filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot in june 2008 the massachusetts supreme judicial court elected on its own motion to hear the appeal which remains pending 

on june 13 2006 june 22 2006 and august 23 2006 three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in united states district court for the district of massachusetts by new south wales treasury corporation as trustee for the alpha international managers trust frank c kalil and don holland and leslie cramer respectively the lawsuits were filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties waste of corporate assets gross mismanagement and unjust enrichment in connection with our historical stock option granting practices the lawsuits also named us as a nominal defendant in december 2006 the court consolidated these three lawsuits and appointed new south wales treasury corporation as the lead plaintiff in february 2007 the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in february 2008 the court dismissed the complaint due to the plaintiffs’ failure to make a demand on our board of directors before initiating their lawsuits the plaintiffs elected not to appeal as the dismissal is now final and unappealable this effectively ended the litigation in december 2007 the plaintiffs also made a demand on our board of directors in may 2008 a special litigation committee of our board of directors refused the demand concluding that it would not be in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue active litigation and that we should seek to settle any claims that we may have 

on august 31 2006 we received an information document request from the internal revenue service “irs” for documents and information relating to our stock option granting practices and related accounting the information document request requests materials related to certain stock options granted between 1998 and 2005 we have received subsequent related requests and we continue to cooperate with the irs to provide the requested information and documents 

one of our subsidiaries spectrasite communications inc “sci” is involved in a lawsuit brought in mexico against a former mexican subsidiary of sci the subsidiary of sci was sold in 2002 prior to our merger with sci’s parent in 2005 the lawsuit concerns a terminated tower construction contract and related agreements with a wireless carrier in mexico the primary issue for us is whether sci itself can be found liable to the mexican carrier the trial and lower appellate courts initially found that sci had no such liability in part because mexican courts do not have full jurisdiction over sci these decisions were appealed by the plaintiff and in july 2008 they were reversed by an intermediate mexican appellate court in its decision the intermediate appellate court identified potential damages of approximately 230 million sci appealed that ruling to a higher constitutional court in mexico in january 2009 the constitutional court ruled in sci’s favor remanding the case back to the intermediate appellate court for further proceedings the intermediate appellate court is now reconsidering its original decision and we are awaiting its ruling as such we are unable to determine at this time whether any of that potential liability survives the decision by the constitutional court or estimate our share if any of that potential liability at this stage of the proceedings 

as discussed in item 1 of this annual report under the caption “regulatory matters” we entered into a facilities audit agreement with the epa that provides for payment of penalties as a result of noncompliance with certain notice and recordkeeping requirements in november 2008 we paid a penalty of approximately 35000 under the facilities audit agreement which satisfied our obligations under the agreement 

we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel other than the legal proceedings discussed above and in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report there are no matters currently pending that would in the event of an adverse outcome have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures in our financial statements actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” beginning at page 45 

our continuing operations are reported in two segments rental and management and network development services management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation amortization and accretion selling general administrative and development expense and impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling general administrative and development expense attributable to the segment excluding stockbased compensation expense and corporate expenses segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income tv azteca net see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein these measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income interest expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations other income expense minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries income on equity method investments income taxes and discontinued operations 

executive overview 

our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment which accounted for approximately 97 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and approximately 99 of our segment operating profit in both years the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases leasing additional space on our existing towers acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadbandservices 

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial noncancelable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december 2008 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods in addition most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers which has the effect of increasing the noncancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows 

the revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically may not be cancelled or in some instances may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee accordingly lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect 

  

on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment during the year ended december 31 2008 tenant leases representing less than 2 of our rental and management revenues were cancelled 

a significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended december 31 2008 was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites during 2008 incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between january 1 2007 and december 31 2008 was approximately 953 million which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites contractual escalators net of straightline accounting treatment and the net increase in straightline revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases partially offset by lease cancellations 

our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and to a lesser extent the location of and available capacity on our existing sites this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital and general economic conditions we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our yearoveryear revenue growth in 2009 

we also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites we constructed or acquired 961 and 462 sites in the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition which affects yearoveryear comparisons during 2008 incremental revenue attributable to the approximately 1420 sites that were built or acquired between january 1 2007 and december 31 2008 was approximately 257 million 

our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance and utilities these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense our segment level selling general administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments such as sales and property management functions in general our segment level selling general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow our profit margin growth is therefore directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period

 total revenues 

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 were 15935 million an increase of 1369 million from the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 1211 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of 159 million

rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 15470 million an increase of 1211 million from the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 953 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between january 1 2007 and december 31 2008 which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites 

  

existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites contractual escalators net of straightline accounting treatment and the net increase in straightline revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases partially offset by lease cancellations approximately 257 million of the increase resulted from approximately 1420 communications sites acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2007 we believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers 

network development services revenue 

network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 465 million an increase of 159 million from the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our site acquisition zoning and permitting services as we continue to focus on and grow our rental and management business however we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 

total operating expenses 

total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2008 were 9868 million a decrease of approximately 915 million from the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease was attributable to decreases in depreciation amortization and accretion expense and selling general administrative and development expense of 1176 million and 61 million respectively these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of 196 million an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of 107 million and an increase in impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense of 20 million

the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2007 is primarily due to the settlement of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation and the related tax effects in november 2007 following approval by the bankruptcy court the verestar settlement agreement became effective we paid the 320 million settlement amount and the litigation was dismissed 

in connection with the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court and the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation we determined that the benefits from certain of verestar’s net operating losses would more likely than not be recoverable by us we had not previously recorded these tax benefits related to net operating losses generated from the operations of verestar and used by us because our ability to realize such benefits was potentially impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation that had yet to be resolved accordingly in november 2007 we recorded 56 million of additional tax benefits related to verestar we also recorded a tax provision of 107 million in loss from discontinued operations net during the three months ended december 31 2007 to write off deferred tax assets associated with verestar that should have been written off in 2002 and removed from the consolidated balance sheet when verestar was deconsolidated upon its bankruptcy filing in december 2003

as a holding company our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 6382 million of total liquidity comprised of approximately 1431 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately 4951 million under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2008 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 1100 million as compared to december 31 2007 summary cash flow information for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is set forth below 

 

 we use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business including tower maintenance and improvements tower construction and das network installations and tower and land acquisitions during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we also used a significant amount of our cash flows to fund refinancing and repurchases of our outstanding indebtedness as well as our stock repurchase programs by refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness we improved our financial position which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders our significant transactions in 2008 included the following 

 

  

   

 as of december 31 2008 we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately 43 billion we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2008 we believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending december 31 2009 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2009 during 2009 if the financial and credit markets improve we expect that we may opportunistically raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes 

cash flows from operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2008 cash provided by operating activities was 7733 million an increase of approximately 806 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations of 1435 million resulting from continued growth in our rental and management segment 

for the year ended december 31 2007 cash provided by operating activities was 6927 million an increase of approximately 719 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of 288 million resulting from the continued growth of our rental and management segment and a decrease in prepaid and other assets which was partially offset by a decrease in noncash items reflected in the statement of operations the decrease in prepaid and other assets was primarily the result of a decrease in deferred tax assets the decrease in noncash items was primarily a result of a reduction of approximately 498 million of net cash receipts related to towers included in the securitization transaction which are classified as restricted cash 

each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2009 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction improvements and acquisitions 

cash flows from investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2008 cash used for investing activities was 2749 million an increase of approximately 888 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately 891 million during the year ended december 31 2008 payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled 2435 million including 1055 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance improvement and augmentation of our existing communications sites 907 million spent in connection with the construction of 676 towers and the installation of 16 inbuilding das networks 417 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements including leases and 56 million spent on information technology improvements in addition during the year ended december 31 2008 we spent 428 million to acquire 269 towers we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria accordingly we may continue to acquire communications sites acquire land under our towers build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria we expect that our 2009 total capital expenditures will be between approximately 2000 million and 2300 million including 450 million for capital improvements and corporate expenditures 

  

between 300 million and 350 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites between 250 million and 300 million of ground lease purchases and between 1000 million and 1200 million for the construction of approximately 700 to 900 new communications sites including towers and das networks and for the installation of shared backup power generators at certain of our tower sites 

for the year ended december 31 2007 cash used for investing activities was 1862 million an increase of approximately 571 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately 569 million during the year ended december 31 2007 payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled 1544 million including 665 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance improvement and augmentation of our existing communications sites 307 million spent in connection with the construction of 152 towers and the installation of 17 inbuilding das networks 444 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements including leases and 127 million spent on information technology improvements in addition during the year ended december 31 2007 we spent 369 million to acquire 293 towers and 71 million to acquire the assets of a structural analysis engineering firm 

cash flows from financing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2008 cash used for financing activities was 3882 million a decrease of approximately 3665 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately 9282 million in purchases of our common stock and a decrease of 447 million in deferred financing costs and other financing activities these decreases were partially offset by the absence of any new debt issuances during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the issuance of approximately 22500 million in debt during the year ended december 31 2007 borrowings under our credit facilities during the year ended december 31 2008 were approximately 5750 million as compared to 21750 million during the year ended december 31 2007 the borrowings and debt issuances were offset by debt repayments of approximately 3275 million and 36122 million during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

for the year ended december 31 2007 cash used for financing activities was 7546 million an increase of approximately 4316 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately 33165 million in repayments of notes payable credit facilities and capital leases and an increase of 13360 million in purchases of our common stock partially offset by an increase of 41830 million in the proceeds received as a result of the issuance of debt and drawdown on the existing credit facilities 

revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2008 we drew down and repaid amounts under the 125 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course and we also repaid 3250 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility using net proceeds from the term loan and available cash as of december 31 2008 we had 7500 million outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately 4951 million under the revolving credit facility 

the borrower under the revolving credit facility is american tower corporation the revolving credit facility has a term of five years and matures on june 8 2012 any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity the revolving credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium the revolving credit facility allows us to use borrowings for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries including without limitation to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and provided certain conditions are met to repurchase our equity securities in each case without additional lender approval 

  

term loan on march 24 2008 we entered into the 3250 million term loan pursuant to the revolving credit facility at closing we received net proceeds of approximately 3217 million from the term loan which together with available cash we used to repay 3250 million of existing indebtedness under the revolving credit facility the term loan is governed by the terms of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility consistent with the terms of the revolving credit facility the borrower under the term loan is american tower corporation and the maturity date for the term loan is june 8 2012 any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity the term loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium 

stock repurchase programs  during the year ended december 31 2008 we maintained two stock repurchase programs a 15 billion stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in february 2007 “2007 buyback” which we ended in february 2008 and a 15 billion stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in february 2008 “2008 buyback” which remains ongoing pursuant to the 2007 buyback we repurchased 43 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 1637 million including commissions and fees during the three months ended march 31 2008 total repurchases under the 2007 buyback were approximately 353 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 145 billion including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 buyback we repurchased 140 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 5333 million including commissions and fees during the year ended december 31 2008 as of december 31 2008 we had repurchased a total of 711 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of 27 billion including commissions and fees pursuant to our stock repurchase programs 

in the near term we expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the financial and credit markets improve we expect that we may opportunistically raise additional capital which we could then use to fund future purchases of our common stock purchases under the 2008 buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases under the 2008 buyback we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors to facilitate repurchases we purchase our common stock pursuant to trading plans under rule 10b51 of the exchange act which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we significantly reduced purchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program based on the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets subsequent to december 31 2008 we repurchased approximately 28000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 08 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 buyback as of february 13 2009 we had repurchased a total of 140 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of 5341 million including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 buyback we expect to continue to manage the pacing of the program in the future in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors 

sales of equity securities we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities for the year ended december 31 2008 we received an aggregate of approximately 829 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants 

  

contractual obligations our contractual obligations relate primarily to the commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 issued in our securitization transaction borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of december 31 2008 in thousands 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

refinancing activities 

in order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness during the year ended december 31 2008 we entered into a 3250 million term loan pursuant to the revolving credit facility and we used the net proceeds together with available cash to repay 3250 million of existing indebtedness under the revolving credit facility as discussed above during the year ended december 31 2008 we also reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of notes into shares of our common stock and we sought to manage our exposure to variable interest rates under our revolving credit facility and term loan by entering into swap agreements as discussed below 

325 convertible notes during the year ended december 31 2008 we issued approximately 15 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of approximately 183 million principal amount of our 325 notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture holders of the 325 notes are entitled to receive 81808 shares of common stock for every 1000 principal amount of notes converted in april 2008 we issued approximately 11 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of approximately 136 million principal amount of our 325 notes in connection with the conversion we paid the holders an aggregate of approximately 02 million calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes in july 2008 we issued a notice for the redemption on august 6 2008 of all of our outstanding 325 notes in accordance with the conversion provisions of the 325 notes and the indenture for the 325 notes holders of the notes had the right at any time until and including but not after the close of business on august 5 2008 to convert their notes into shares of our common stock holders of all 47 million of the outstanding 325 notes converted their notes into an aggregate of approximately 04 million shares of our common stock prior to redemption as a result as of august 6 2008 none of the 325 notes remained outstanding 

  

300 convertible notes during the year ended december 31 2008 we issued 89 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of approximately 1828 million principal amount of our 300 notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture holders of the 300 notes are entitled to receive 487805 shares of common stock for every 1000 principal amount of notes converted in connection with the conversions we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately 47 million calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes as of december 31 2008 1622 million principal amount of the 300 notes remained outstanding 

interest rate swap agreements  during the year ended december 31 2008 we entered into twelve additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted interest payments under the revolving credit facility and term loan as of december 31 2008 we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which have an aggregate notional amount of 7750 million interest rates ranging from 286 to 408 and expiration dates through march 2011 

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2008 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to revolving credit facility and term loan the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens as well as the following three financial maintenance tests 

 

  

  

 as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests 

the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility but would constitute a default which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable 

restrictions under loan agreement relating to securitization transaction the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special 

  

purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors the loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization transaction and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations 

failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization transaction the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 

restrictions under notes indentures the indentures governing the terms of our 750 notes and 7125 notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments with the exception of spectrasite and its subsidiaries most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures this means among other things that those subsidiaries like american tower corporation itself are subject to those indentures’ restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to unrestricted subsidiaries or otherwise pay out of the restricted group in addition certain of spectrasite’s subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction as discussed above any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow the indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants 

if a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan or the indentures for our other debt securities the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility until we cured the default if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

as of december 31 2008 our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately 2298 million 2832 million 2223 million 22 billion 1378 million and 26 billion respectively in addition as a holding company we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction permit certain of spectrasite’s subsidiaries to make distributions to us such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us accordingly if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which is subject to many factors beyond our control as outlined above in item 1a 

  

of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” in addition our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies which are dependent on our expected financial performance the liquidity factors discussed above and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or if such financings are completed that the terms will be commercially reasonable particularly in light of the recent downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to income taxes asset retirement obligations stockbased compensation impairment of assets revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2008 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result for a discussion of our other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning on page f7 

 

 we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 100 million as of december 31 2008 we have classified approximately 247 million as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 291 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized” we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2008 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 474 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards equity investments and foreign items we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twentyyear tax 

  

carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability 

the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 14 billion and 13 billion in federal and state taxable income respectively from january 1 2009 to december 31 2028 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations 

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2008 

as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in april 2008 verestar’s plan of liquidation was approved by the bankruptcy court and in december 2008 verestar was liquidated as a result we recorded an income tax benefit of 1101 million related to losses associated with our investment in verestar as income from discontinued operations during the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 130 million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 38 million respectively the increase in 2008 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions and the purchase of land underlying ground leases fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions 

  

are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

 

  

 assets subject to depreciation and amortization and noncore longlived assets held for sale we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment whenever events changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 

goodwill—assets not subject to amortization we perform our annual goodwill impairment test each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired in december 2008 2007 and 2006 we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information changes to which could affect those fair value estimates

remediation of prior material weakness 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2007 we determined that as of december 31 2007 we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we failed to maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes with respect to determining documenting tracking and adjusting our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a timely manner basis during the three months ended december 31 2007 we recorded adjustments to the income tax provision for amounts that should have been recorded in prior reporting periods the adjustments were identified in connection with our yearend tax analyses and related primarily to our cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities the principal components of the adjustments resulted from i a deferred foreign tax liability from foreign currency fluctuations arising out of certain longterm intercompany loan transactions involving our brazilian subsidiary and ii changes to certain deferred tax assets and liabilities including those arising out of the discontinued operations of our verestar subsidiary which was discontinued in 2002 and deconsolidated upon filing for bankruptcy protection in 2003 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we implemented the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting that contributed to the remediation of the material weakness described above 

 

  

  

  

 we have evaluated and tested the effectiveness of these controls as of december 31 2008 and determined that our previously reported material weakness has been remediated 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we have restated our consolidated financial statements as further discussed in the “explanatory note” in the forepart of this form 10ka and in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10ka and the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations reflect this restatement 

  

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures in our financial statements actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” on page 52 

  

stock option review and restatement of financial statements 

  

as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the restatement reflected in this form 10ka corrects certain errors related to i stockbased compensation not previously recorded for certain stock option grants including the related payroll and income tax effects ii additional charges for stockbased compensation expense related to the modification and repricing of certain stock option grants primarily associated with options awarded to two former executive officers and iii changes to income taxes related to the tax effects of foreign currency fluctuations on an intercompany loan with a foreign subsidiary our decision to restate our previously issued financial statements was based in part on an independent review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting on may 19 2006 we announced that our board of directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic auditors the special committee determined that for certain stock option grants the legal grant dates when all necessary corporate action had been taken differ from the dates previously recorded by us for financial accounting and tax purposes 

  

the special committee reviewed substantially all stock options granted during the period from our becoming a public company in june 1998 through may 2006 including all option grants to our officers and directors all option grants to individuals in excess of 100000 shares and all option grants to employees in connection with our annual allemployee option grant program on november 6 2006 the special committee reported to our board of directors regarding its findings the following is a summary of the special committee’s key findings 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the special committee will recommend to our board of directors a remediation plan to address the issues raised by its findings while the special committee has not yet finalized its remediation recommendations they are expected to include recommendations regarding improved stock option administration procedures and controls with respect to which as noted above the committee found that management had already made certain changes training and monitoring of compliance with those procedures corporate risk assessment and evaluation of the internal compliance environment and an evaluation by our chief executive officer of the company’s resources especially with respect to compliance and administration the special committee has concluded that it will not recommend any terminations or that any changes in positions of current executive management be made as a result of its findings it is expected to recommend however that our chief executive officer review and evaluate the organization of the company’s senior management consistent with the findings of the special committee and report back to the board on any changes that should be made to the company’s organizational plan or to the duties of members of current management 

  

in connection with the review by the special committee we undertook a review of option grant dates recorded for financial accounting and tax purposes based on our facts and circumstances we concluded that we should use the legal grant date as determined by the special committee as the accounting measurement date for such awards accordingly based on this conclusion we applied new measurement dates to the affected stock option grants and as a result determined that charges for stockbased compensation expense and related payroll and income tax effects were required in instances where the quoted market price of the underlying stock at the 

  

new measurement date exceeded the employee’s exercise price in accordance with apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees ” in addition the restatement reflects charges for penalties and interest related to the failure to properly withhold employee taxes upon exercise of certain stock options that were originally classified as incentive stock options but were recharacterized as nonqualified stock options as a result of applying a new measurement date to such options 

  

with respect to our results of operations the restatement adjustments reflected in this form 10ka primarily impacted our selling general administrative and development expense and our income tax provision benefit the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 below includes a discussion of the impact of the restatement on these items on a quarterly basis 

  

executive overview 

  

our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment which accounted for approximately 984 and 969 of our total revenues and approximately 995 and 993 of our segment operating profit for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases leasing additional space on our existing towers acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled we continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity in addition we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadbandservices customers 

  

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of fivetoten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods in addition most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally threetofive percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable term of the applicable agreement 

  

the revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically may not be cancelled or in some instances may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee accordingly lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment during 2005 tenant leases representing less than 2 of our total revenues were cancelled 

  

a significant majority of our revenue growth in 2005 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and inbuilding systems acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc in august 2005 we completed our merger with spectrasite inc an owner and operator of approximately 7800 wireless and broadcast towers and inbuilding systems in the united states the merger was approved by our and spectrasite’s stockholders on august 3 2005 and the results of operations of spectrasite have been included in our consolidated results of operations since that date during the period august 3 2005 through december 31 2005 spectrasite generated total revenues of 1712 million and operating profit of 1068 million 

  

our revenue growth in 2005 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites during 2005 incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between january 1 2004 and december 31 2005 was approximately 633 million which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rate changes offset by lease cancellations 

  

our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and to a lesser extent the location of and available capacity on our existing sites this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services 

  

our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and to a lesser extent the location of and available capacity on our existing sites this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital and general economic conditions we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our yearoveryear revenue growth in 2006 

  

we also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites in addition to the approximately 7800 towers and inbuilding systems acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc we constructed or acquired 289 and 275 sites in 2005 and 2004 respectively because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition which affects yearoveryear comparisons during 2005 revenue attributable to these 564 sites that were built or acquired between january 1 2004 and december 31 2005 was approximately 108 million 

  

our continuing operations are reported in two business segments rental and management and network development services management focuses on segment gross margin and operating profit loss as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation amortization and accretion selling general administrative and development expense and impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling general administrative and development expense attributable to the segment excluding stockbased compensation expense and corporate expenses segment gross margin and operating profit loss for the rental and management segment include interest income tv azteca net see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

  

our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance and utilities these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense our segment level selling general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments such as sales and property management functions in general our segment level selling general and administrative expenses do not increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year as a result leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow our profit margin growth is therefore directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period 

  

results of operations 

  

years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

   

total revenues 

  

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 were 9448 million an increase of 2381 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 1712 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by spectrasite the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of 741 million partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of 72 million 

  

rental and management revenue 

  

rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 9298 million an increase of 2453 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 1712 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by spectrasite approximately 633 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between january 1 2004 and december 31 2005 which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites contractual escalators net of straightline accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates offset by lease cancellations approximately 108 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2004 other than in connection with the spectrasite merger we believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers 

  

network development services revenue 

  

network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 150 million a decrease of 72 million from year ended december 31 2004 the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition zoning and permitting services primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with spectrasite inc as we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business and offer only limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues 

  

total operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2005 were 8097 million an increase of 1618 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation amortization and accretion expense of 818 million an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of 525 million an increase in selling general administrative and development expense of 250 million and an increase in impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense of 104 million these increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of 79 million we expect our total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 to include approximately 380 million to 400 million related to the january 1 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r regarding stockbased compensation expense as described below in “—recent accounting pronouncements”

rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 2478 million an increase of 525 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 531 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by spectrasite excluding the impact of expenses incurred by spectrasite rental and management expense did not change materially as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 

  

rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2005 was 6962 million an increase of 1927 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 1181 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment operating profit generated by spectrasite the balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of january 1 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2004 other than in connection with the spectrasite merger and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates 

  

network development services expense 

  

network development services expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 84 million a decrease of 79 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the majority of the decrease correlates directly to the decline in services performed as noted above 

  

depreciation amortization and accretion 

  

depreciation amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 4113 million an increase of 818 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to approximately 780 million of depreciation amortization and accretion expense related to longlived assets acquired in connection with the spectrasite merger and approximately 38 million related to other newly acquired or constructed towers and other longlived assets we expect our depreciation amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december 31 2006 to increase by approximately 1310 million including approximately 1100 million related to the inclusion of a full year of expense related to acquired spectrasite longlived assets and approximately 210 million related to the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations described below 

  

selling general administrative and development expense 

  

selling general administrative and development expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 1081 million an increase of 250 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 186 million of the increase was attributable to general and administrative expense incurred by spectrasite the balance of the increase was primarily attributable to employee bonuses including amounts paid in connection with the closing of the spectrasite merger offset by a decrease of 33 million in stockbased compensation expense which aggregated 66 million and 99 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

the following table sets forth stockbased compensation included in selling general administrative and development expense by quarter for 2004 and 2005 in thousands 

  

   

the decrease in stockbased compensation from 2004 was the result of lower expenses related to modifications and repricings associated with stock options awarded to two former executive officers which decreased to 32 million in 2005 from 49 million in 2004 as well as lower stockbased compensation associated with options granted with an exercise price below the quoted marked price of the underlying stock at the accounting measurement date in 2004 approximately 35 million of the expense related to modifications and repricings was recorded in the quarter ended june 30 2004 including 21 million associated with a separation agreement with our former chief operating officer that provided for the reinstatement of previously terminated options the substantial majority of other stockbased compensation related to modifications and repricings recorded in 2005 and 2004 was associated with two options granted to our former chief financial officer that were accounted for as an indirect repricing 

  

as a result of the january 1 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r we expect our total selling general administrative and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 to include approximately 380 million to 400 million of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 342 million an increase of 104 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was due primarily to merger related expense of 90 million incurred in connection with the spectrasite merger including employee separation costs of 31 million amortization of unearned compensation relating to unvested stock options assumed of 24 million and other employee stock option charges of 35 million restructuring expense and stockbased compensation expense also increased by 46 million related to modified option awards which was partially offset by a decline of 32 million in impairments and net losses on sales of longlived noncore assets 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 2224 million a decrease of 398 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease resulted primarily as a result of the redemption of all of our outstanding 9 3  8  notes repurchases of our ati 1225 notes conversions of our 325 notes and the refinancing of the american tower credit facility at lower interest rates this decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest payable on our 750 notes 300 convertible notes due august 15 2012 300 notes notes and 7125 notes issued in february august and september of 2004 respectively and approximately 152 million of interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the spectrasite merger 

  

loss on retirement of longterm obligations 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we redeemed 2749 million principal amount of our 9 3  8  notes repurchased 1778 million accreted value of our ati 1225 notes and converted 571 million principal amount of our 325 notes in addition we refinanced the american tower and spectrasite credit facilities as a result of these transactions we recorded a 671 million charge primarily related to the writeoff of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value for more information regarding our financing activities see “—liquidity and capital resources—financing activities” below 

  

during the year ended december 31 2004 we redeemed all of our outstanding 625 convertible notes redeemed and repurchased portions of our outstanding 9 3  8  notes ati 1225 notes and 50 convertible notes and refinanced of our credit facility as a result of these transactions we recorded a 1380 million charge related to the writeoff of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value 

  

other income 

  

other income for the year ended december 31 2005 was 02 million a decrease of 30 million from other expense of 28 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately 29 million of other income generated on interest rate swap agreements assumed in the spectrasite merger 

  

income tax provision benefit 

  

the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2005 was 57 million as compared to an 833 million tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2004 representing a decrease of 891 million from the prior year period the effective tax rate was 42 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 256 for the year ended december 31 2004 the provision for the year ended december 31 2005 reflects a 295 million charge as a result of a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims as described below 

  

the following table sets forth income tax provisions benefits related to the tax effects of foreign currency fluctuations on an intercompany loan with a foreign subsidiary by quarter for 2005 and 2004 in thousands 

  

   

the changes in the annual and quarterly impact on income taxes noted above are directly attributable to changes in the mexican peso to us dollar exchange rate tax provisions are recorded in periods in which the mexican peso to us dollar exchange rate declines 

  

the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims as more fully described below and foreign items the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items 

  

we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses in june 2003 and october 2003 we filed federal income tax refund claims with the irs relating to the carry back of 3800 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003 of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately 900 million based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately 650 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006 there can be no assurances however with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund 

  

minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries 

  

minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2005 was 06 million a decrease of 18 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease is primarily a result of the company’s purchase during 2004 of the remaining 120 interest in atc mexico that it did not own

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net 

  

as of december 31 2005 we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” fin no 47 as a result we recognized a 355 million charge net of an 117 million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the adoption of fin no 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations as fin no 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment net of 669 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other longterm obligations of 1140 million

wireless and broadband tenants to towers that existed as of january 1 2003 and to a lesser extent from revenue generated on the approximately 900 towers acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2003 this increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue on the approximately 400 owned towers sold or disposed of subsequent to january 1 2003 in 2004 our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning january 1 2003 and ending december 31 2004 was approximately 51 million we believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we improved our financial flexibility by refinancing our existing debt with less restrictive lower cost capital which increased our liquidity and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant transactions included the following 

  

   

   

   

   

as of december 31 2005 we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately 36 billion we incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of tower sites and services businesses and capital expenditures related to the construction of new tower sites beginning in 2002 we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness in 2003 2004 and 2005 we continued this effort by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility and since 2004 by using cash flow from operations to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt to reduce our net total indebtedness 

  

in 2005 we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations we believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending december 31 2006 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2006 for information about our outstanding indebtedness see “—contractual obligations” below 

  

we expect our 2006 cash needs related to indebtedness outstanding as of december 31 2005 to consist primarily of the following debt service including cash interest of approximately 1890 million approximately 1795 million for the february 1 2006 redemption of the remaining outstanding ati 1225 notes and capital lease payments and other notes payable including interest of approximately 52 million we expect to fund capital expenditures of between 1100 and 1300 million principally related to new tower construction improvements to existing towers and installation of new inbuilding systems in 2006 we also expect to use approximately 227 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares of atc south america that we do not own as discussed above in “business—recent transactions—atc international transactions” in addition we expect to continue to fund our stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional 6734 million of our class a common stock in 2006 we also may fund additional purchases of our class a common stock either pursuant to or supplemental to our stock repurchase program we expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

uses of cash 

  

stock repurchase program  in november 2005 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 7500 million of our class a common stock through december 2006 we expect to utilize cash from operations borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to fund the repurchase program under the program our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors to facilitate repurchases we entered into a trading plan under rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods the program may be discontinued at any time as of december 31 2005 we had repurchased 28 million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate of 766 million between january 1 2006 and march 9 2006 we repurchased an additional 39 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate of 1174 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program 

  

tower construction and improvements and inbuilding system installation during the year ended december 31 2005 payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled 886 million including capital expenditures incurred in connection with the construction of 245 towers and the installation of 14 inbuilding systems we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions accordingly we may continue to acquire communications sites build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria we anticipate that in 2006 we will build approximately 275 new towers and install approximately 40 new inbuilding systems and expect our 2006 total capital expenditures for construction improvements and corporate purposes to be between approximately 1100 million and 1300 million 

  

refinancing and repurchases of debt in order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility we use our cash to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness during the year ended december 31 2005 we repurchased redeemed and converted approximately 6057 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities for more information about our financing activities see “—financing activities” below in october 2005 we also refinanced the american tower credit facility and the spectrasite credit facility with new credit facilities see “—sources of cash” below in addition in december 2005 we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding 2277 million face amount of ati 1225 notes which we redeemed on february 1 2006 see “—financing activities” below

interest rate swap agreements  in the fourth quarter of 2005 we entered into eight interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under our new credit facilities the swaps have an aggregate notional amount of 4500 million a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 485 and expire in october 2010 during january 2006 we also entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 1000 million a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 468 and will expire in october 2010 we have designated these swaps as cash flow hedges 

  

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers 

  

restrictions under credit facilities the american tower and spectrasite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions including limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens with which the borrowers and their restricted 

  

subsidiaries must comply each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply 

  

   

   

as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests 

  

any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the american tower credit facility or the spectrasite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving loans but would constitute a default resulting in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable the credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and provided certain conditions are met permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval 

  

restrictions under notes indentures the indenture governing the terms of the ati 725 notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ati the sister guarantors as defined and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the american tower credit facility these include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments spectrasite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ati 725 notes and are not subject to such restrictions any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically the indenture restricts ati the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock other than debt under the american tower credit facility or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings up to 16 billion 

  

the indentures governing the terms of our 750 notes and 7125 notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments spectrasite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 750 notes and 7125 notes and are not subject to such restrictions any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow we are permitted however to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities 

  

if a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

  

as of december 31 2005 our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately 3738 million 4571 million 1790 million 1787 million 18 billion and 18 billion respectively in addition as a holding company we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries or funds raised through debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ati 725 notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances 

  

accordingly if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance such debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which is subject to many factors beyond our control as outlined above in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” in addition our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies which are dependent on our expected financial performance the liquidity factors discussed above and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or if such refinancings are obtained that the terms will be commercially reasonable 

  

capital markets  our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on among other things general economic conditions conditions of the wireless industry our financial performance and the state of the capital markets in april 2004 the sec declared effective our “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to 10 billion of debt andor equity securities as of december 31 2005 we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to income taxes purchase price allocation asset retirement obligations stockbased compensation impairment of assets and revenue recognition management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result for a discussion of our other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10ka beginning on page f7 

  

   

we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses in june 2003 and october 2003 we filed federal income tax refund claims with the irs relating to the carry back of 3800 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003 of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately 

  

900 million based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately 650 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006 there can be no assurances however with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund 

  

the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 13 billion in taxable income from january 1 2006 to december 31 2025 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 

  

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded a 295 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2005 

  

depending on the resolution of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in verestar no income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings 

  

   

   

   

as of december 31 2005 we adopted the provisions of fin no 47 and recognized a 355 million charge net of an 117 million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 this adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately 1140 million to 1642 million as of december 31 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment net of 669 million the adoption of fin no 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions as fin no 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating the company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

  

   

while our financial statements have used the above measure statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 also historically required that we present in the footnotes to our financial statements pro forma financial results as if a fair value method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument were applied under sfas no 123 the fair value of the stock option is determined using an optionpricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we reevaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense as a result we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after july 1 2005 to approximately 30 and increased the expected life of option grants to 625 years using the simplified method permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 107 “sharebased payment” sab no 107 we made this change based on a number of factors including our execution of our strategic 

  

plans to sell noncore businesses reduce leverage and refinance our debt and our merger with spectrasite we had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information including historical volatility implied volatility of publicly traded options our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” sfas no 123r which supersedes apb no 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” we adopted sfas no 123r as of january 1 2006 under the modified prospective method in which compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas no 123r sfas no 123r primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards under sfas no 123r the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under sfas no 123 and adjusted for estimated forfeitures these fair value and forfeiture assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense for more information on sfas no 123r see “—recent accounting pronouncements” below 

  

   

assets subject to depreciation and amortization and noncore longlived assets held for sale we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment whenever events changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows as well as through other analytical methods if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 

  

goodwill—assets not subject to amortization we perform our annual goodwill impairment test on december 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired in december 2005 2004 and 2003 we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information changes to which could affect those fair value estimates our december 2005 annual impairment testing included 15 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with spectrasite inc 

  

   

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r sfas no 123r revises sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas no 123 supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” this statement addressed the accounting for sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options under the new standard companies will no longer be able to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb no 25 instead companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fairvalue method and recognize the related expense associated with sharebased payments in the statement of operations sfas no 123r is effective for us as of january 1 2006 we have historically accounted for sharebased payments to employees under apb no 25’s intrinsic value method we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 123r under the modified prospective method in which compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas no 123r and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas no 123r is recognized based on sfas no 123 tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for sharebased payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations we estimate that we will recognize stockbased compensation expense of approximately 38 million to 40 million for the year ending december 31 2006 under the provisions of sfas no 123r this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006 including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates sfas no 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on among other factors future employee stock option exercises due to the our tax loss position there was no operating cash inflow realized for december 31 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions 

  

in march 2005 the sec issued sab no 107 regarding the staff’s interpretation of sfas no 123r this interpretation provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas no 123r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no 107 in connection with our adoption of sfas no 123r

the following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 750 notes 7125 notes and ati 725 notes collectively the notes the information contained in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements is also presented to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our ati 725 notes 

  

the indentures governing the notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding notes in order for the holders of the notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the sec our tower cash flow adjusted consolidated cash flow and nontower cash flow each as defined in the indentures under the indentures our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of adjusted consolidated cash flow that we generate which is determined based on our tower cash flow and nontower cash flow in addition the indentures for the notes restrict us from incurring additional 

  

debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow as of december 31 2005 the ratio of our consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flow was approximately 55 for more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—factors affecting sources of liquidity”

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

  

we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company with a portfolio of over 22000 owned communications sites our portfolio includes approximately 20000 owned tower sites in the united states and over 2500 in mexico and brazil in addition to our owned tower sites we offer access to over 10000 rooftop and tower sites in the united states that we manage for third parties we also operate inbuilding distributed antenna systems in malls and casinohotel resorts our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies we operate the largest independent portfolio of wireless and broadcast communications sites in the united states mexico and brazil based on number of sites and revenue 

  

our communications site portfolio provides us with a recurring base of leasing revenues from our existing customers and growth potential due to the capacity to add more tenants and equipment to these sites our broad network of communications sites enables us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging wireless service providers we also offer limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we intend to capitalize on the continuing increase in the use of wireless communications services by actively marketing space available for leasing on our existing sites and selectively developing or acquiring new sites that meet our return on investment criteria 

  

our site leasing business which we also refer to as our rental and management segment accounted for approximately 995 and 993 of our segment operating profit for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively in 2006 we expect that our rental and management segment will continue to contribute approximately 99 of our segment operating profit which we define as segment revenue less direct segment expense rental and management segment operating profit includes interest income tv azteca net 

  

over the last three years we have focused our operations on our rental and management segment by selling numerous noncore assets and businesses and using the proceeds from these sales to purchase high quality tower assets and reduce our outstanding indebtedness with the sale of our tower construction services unit in november 2004 we substantially completed our strategic transition to a focused site leasing company 

  

in august 2005 we expanded our communications site portfolio and our rental and management operations through our merger with spectrasite inc an owner and operator of approximately 7800 wireless and broadcast towers and inbuilding systems in the united states we believe the merger provided us with significant strategic and financial advantages we believe our larger scale will translate into increased cooperation with our customers and create greater flexibility to structure mutually beneficial contracts potentially resulting in further increases in revenue and market share we also believe the merger will enable us to maximize our return on investment by creating a significantly larger revenue base over which to spread our relatively fixed overhead costs therefore further capitalizing on the significant operating leverage inherent in the tower business model for more information about our merger with spectrasite inc see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

we believe our strategy of focusing operations on our rental and management segment has made our consolidated operating cash flows more stable will provide us with continuing growth and will enhance our returns on invested capital because of the following characteristics of our core leasing business 

  

   

   

   

   

strategy 

  

our strategy is to capitalize on the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and the infrastructure requirements necessary to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies 

  

   

   

we believe the continuing growth in the number of wireless service subscribers and the minutes of use per subscriber will require wireless carriers to add new cell sites and new equipment to existing cell sites to maintain the performance of their networks in the areas they currently cover and to extend service to areas where coverage does not yet exist as wireless carriers continue to add subscribers and seek to limit churn we also anticipate they will focus on network quality as a competitive necessity and will invest in upgrades to their networks in addition we believe that as wireless data services such as email internet access and video are deployed on a widespread basis the deployment of these technologies may require wireless carriers to further increase the cell density of their existing networks may require new technology and equipment and may increase the demand for geographic expansion of their network coverage to meet this demand we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means of accelerating access to their markets and preserving capital rather than constructing and operating their own communications sites and maintaining their own communications sites service and development capabilities 

  

we believe that our existing portfolio of communications sites our towerrelated services offerings and our management team position us to benefit from these trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters the key elements of our strategy include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

the company 

  

american tower corporation was created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 to own manage develop and lease communications and broadcast tower sites and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 over the last ten years we have grown our communications site portfolio through tower acquisitions tower development and construction and through mergers with and acquisitions of other tower operators increasing the size of our communications site portfolio to over 22000 owned sites

we lease antenna space on our wireless communications towers to customers in a diverse range of wireless industries including personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio paging and fixed microwave our major domestic wireless customers include alltel cingular wireless sprint nextel tmobile usa and verizon wireless our major international wireless customers include iusacell celular nextel mexico telefonica moviles and unefon in mexico and nextel brazil telecom americas and telecom italia mobile in brazil for the year ended december 31 2005 assuming our merger with spectrasite inc occurred on january 1 2005 we had three customers that each accounted for greater than 10 of our total revenues cingular wireless accounted for approximately 19 of our 2005 total revenues sprint nextel assuming the merger of sprint pcs and nextel occurred on january 1 2005 accounted for approximately 17 approximately 22 including sprint nextel partners and affiliates and verizon wireless accounted for approximately 10 approximately 59 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 were derived from five customers see item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors—a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers” and “—due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the credit worthiness of its tenants” 

  

the number of antennas that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the tower’s location height and the structural capacity at certain wind speeds an antenna’s height on a tower and the tower’s location 

  

determine the lineofsight of the antenna with the horizon and coupled with the specific band of radio frequency and technology used by the carrier determine the distance a signal can be transmitted some of our customers such as personal communications services enhanced specialized mobile radio providers and cellular companies in metropolitan areas typically do not place their equipment at the highest tower point other customers including paging companies and specialized mobile radio providers in rural areas prefer higher elevations for broader coverage we believe that a significant majority of our towers have the capacity to add additional tenants 

  

our leases with wireless communications providers in the united states generally have initial terms of fivetoten years in mexico and brazil our typical tenant lease has an initial term of ten years in most cases our tenant leases have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant wireless carriers generally renew their leases with us because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in an existing carrier’s network is expensive and often requires reconfiguring several other sites in the carrier’s network which may impact the quality of the carrier’s coverage and may require the carrier to obtain other governmental permits most of our tenant leases have escalation provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these automatic increases are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation 

  

annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

broadcast communications towers we are one of the largest independent owners and operators of broadcast towers in the united states and mexico we own approximately 220 broadcast towers in the united states and have exclusive rights to approximately 190 in mexico broadcast towers generally are taller and structurally more complex than wireless communications towers require unique engineering skills and are more costly to build we lease antenna space on our broadcast towers primarily to radio and television broadcast companies in leasing antenna space we generally receive monthly fees from customers with initial lease periods ranging from tentotwenty years 

  

inbuilding neutral host distributed antenna systems as a result of our merger with spectrasite inc we are now a leading provider in the united states of inbuilding neutral host distributed antenna systems we have approximately 100 inbuilding systems in operation in retail shopping malls and casinohotel resorts and we have the exclusive rights to an additional 200 properties in the united states we obtain rights to install and operate inbuilding systems by entering into leases with property owners which are generally for an initial noncancelable period of ten years some of these leases contain automatic extension provisions and continue after the initial period unless terminated by us under these leases we are the exclusive operator of inbuilding neutral host distributed antenna systems for the term of the lease we are also responsible for marketing the property as part of our portfolio of communications sites and for installing operating and maintaining the distributed antenna system at the properties we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our inbuilding system for a fee under licenses that typically have an initial noncancelable term of ten years we typically share a portion of the licensing fees with the property owners 

  

rooftop management we also provide rooftop management services to property owners in the united states we market over 10000 rooftop sites to our customers in the united states that we manage for third 

  

parties including approximately 1100 rooftop sites that were revenueproducing as of december 31 2005 wireless carriers use rooftop sites to install their communications equipment generally where there are no existing towers or where new towers are difficult to build we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into contracts with property owners which are generally for an initial period of threetofive years these contracts typically contain automatic extension provisions and continue after the initial period unless terminated by either party under these contracts we are engaged by property owners as the exclusive manager for a rooftop for these services we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid by the wireless carriers 

  

network development services 

  

we offer towerrelated services through our network development services segment we historically offered extensive towerrelated services to support our site leasing business as we continued to focus our operations on our rental and management segment we sold services businesses that did not provide incremental value to our site leasing business with the sale of our tower construction services unit in november 2004 we substantially completed our strategic transition to a focused site leasing company our network development services segment continues to provide site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services that support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 

  

site acquisition zoning and permitting services we engage in site acquisition services for our own account in connection with our tower development projects as well as for our customers we typically work with our customers’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where the customer needs to construct a new tower site to address its coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site under applicable law 

  

structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of communications equipment on towers a structural analysis of a tower is routinely performed prior to a decision by a wireless carrier to install equipment on a tower our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if augmentation is needed which enables our customers to better assess potential tower sites before making an installation decision

regulatory matters 

  

towers and antennas both the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting these regulations govern the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the faa towers requiring faa approval must be registered with the fcc and must be painted and lighted in accordance with the faa’s standards the faa review and the fcc registration processes are prerequisites to use of the tower by fcc licensees as well as our other customers tower owners are responsible for notifying the faa of any tower lighting outages or malfunctions and for timely repairing lighting outages or malfunctions tower owners also must notify the fcc when ownership of a tower changes we generally indemnify our customers against noncompliance with applicable standards noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties 

  

the fcc considers the construction of a new tower or the addition of a new antenna to an existing site including building rooftops and watertanks to be a federal undertaking subject to prior environmental review and approval under the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa which obligates federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of undertakings to determine whether they may significantly affect the environment the fcc has issued regulations implementing nepa as well as the national historic preservation act and the endangered species act these regulations obligate each fcc applicant or licensee to investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower or adding a new antenna to a site if a tower or new antenna may have a significant impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by limiting state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of wireless communications towers the law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations the telecommunications act of 1996 also requires the federal government to help licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for towers 

  

we are subject to local and county zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often are 

  

opposed to construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction and the addition of new antennas to a site existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could adversely affect our construction activities and operations 

  

our tower operations in mexico and brazil are also subject to regulation if we pursue additional international opportunities we will be subject to regulations in additional foreign jurisdictions in addition our customers both domestic and foreign also may be subject to new regulatory policies that may adversely affect the demand for communications sites 

  

environmental matters our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under those laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination 

  

we and our customers also may be required to obtain permits comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances used at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines andor criminal sanctions in october 2001 we paid 150000 in civil penalties and entered into a settlement agreement that expires in 2006 related to certain alleged environmental permitting and filing violations in the county of santa clara california 

  

in november 2005 we finalized a facilities audit agreement with the united states environmental protection agency epa pursuant to the epa’s voluntary audit and disclosure policy under the facilities audit agreement we have agreed to audit by february 2007 the tower sites in our portfolio as of july 2005 ie legacy american tower sites but not spectrasite sites for compliance with the notice and recordkeeping requirements under the emergency protection and community right to know act epcra the clean air act the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act we will inform the epa of any violations of the abovereferenced statutes at a given tower site and take steps to cure the violations the facilities audit agreement provides for stipulated penalties for violations under epcra and for violations under the remaining statutes we will pay a penalty based on our economic benefit of noncompliance we do not expect that the aggregate penalties payable under the facilities audit agreement will be material to our financial condition or results of operations 

  

health and safety we are subject to the occupational safety and health act and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure our field personnel are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha and equivalent state agencies concerning health and safety matters 

  

competition and customer demand 

  

rental and management 

  

our rental and management segment competes with other national and regional tower companies such as crown castle international corp global signal inc and sba communications corp wireless carriers and 

  

broadcasters that own and operate their own tower networks and lease tower space to third parties numerous independent tower owners and the owners of noncommunications tower sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity price and quality of service historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

  

customer demand for our rental and management segment is also affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies technologies that make it possible for wireless carriers to expand their use of existing infrastructure could reduce customer demand for our communications sites the increased use of spectrally efficient airlink technologies such as lowerrate vocoders which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space 

  

in addition any increase in the use of network sharing or roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers also could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements enable a provider to serve customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers such as the october 2004 merger between cingular wireless and att wireless and the august 2005 merger between sprint pcs and nextel could have a similar impact on customer demand for our tower sites because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap although we do not expect the cingularatt wireless merger or the sprint pcsnextel merger to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations significant consolidation among wireless carriers may adversely affect demand for our tower sites and accordingly our revenues and cash flows 

  

network development services 

  

our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions on network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

  

we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our rental and management and network development services segments 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2005 we employed 904 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk   factors tableend   

decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

  

many of the factors affecting the demand for wireless communications tower space and to a lesser extent our network development services business could adversely affect our operating results those factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the demand for broadcast antenna space is dependent on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission we could also be affected adversely should the development of digital television be further delayed or impaired or if demand for it were less than anticipated because of delays disappointing technical performance or cost to the consumer 

  

if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap as do their expansion plans for example as a result of the recently completed mergers between cingular wireless and att wireless and between sprint pcs and nextel both cingular wireless and sprint nextel are exploring ways of rationalizing portions of their combined yet technologically separate wireless networks certain parts of their merged networks may be deemed to be duplicative and these customers may attempt to eliminate these duplications our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these contracts are eliminated from our ongoing contractual revenues similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space 

  

in january 2003 the fcc eliminated its spectrum cap which prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area the fcc has also eliminated the crossinterest rule for metropolitan areas which limited an entity’s ability to own interests in multiple cellular licenses in an overlapping geographical service area also in may 2003 the fcc adopted new rules authorizing wireless radio services holding exclusive licenses to freely lease unused spectrum these regulatory changes may encourage consolidation among wireless carriers which if it resulted in a loss of one or more of our major customers could materially decrease our revenues and cash flows 

  

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

  

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 36 billion of consolidated debt our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness as of december 31 2005 approximately 41 of our outstanding indebtedness bore interest at floating rates approximately 21 after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements used to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations on our credit facilities as a result our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we may also obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

  

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and indentures could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

  

our credit facilities and the indentures governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants our credit facilities also contain requirements that the borrowers under each facility comply with certain leverage and other financial tests these covenants and requirements limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness engaging in various types of transactions including mergers and sales of assets and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisition or other opportunities 

  

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants 

  

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage during the past few years several of our customers have filed for bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues if one or more of our major customers experience financial difficulties it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and our loss of significant customers and anticipated lease revenues 

  

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

  

our business operations in mexico and brazil and any other possible foreign operations in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 13 of our consolidated revenues were generated by our international operations assuming our merger with spectrasite inc occurred on january 1 2005 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates while most of the contracts for our international operations are denominated in the us dollar others are denominated in the mexican peso or the brazilian real we have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and we may suffer future losses as a result of adverse changes in currency exchange rates 

  

a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers 

  

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers for the year ended december 31 2005 after giving effect to our merger with spectrasite inc assuming the merger occurred on january 1 2005 

  

   

   

   

   

our largest international customer is iusacell celular which accounted for approximately 3 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 assuming our merger with spectrasite inc occurred on january 1 2005 iusacell is an affiliate of tv azteca which owns a minority interest in unefon which is our second largest customer in mexico and accounted for approximately 2 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 assuming our merger with spectrasite inc occurred on january 1 2005 in addition we received 142 million in interest income net from tv azteca for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

if any of these customers were unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we also sometimes experience disputes with our customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our agreements although historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on our company or our customer relationships in the future these disputes could lead to a termination of our agreements with customers or a material modification of the terms of those agreements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

status of iusacell celular’s financial restructuring exposes us to certain risks and uncertainties 

  

iusacell celular is our largest customer in mexico and accounted for approximately 3 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 assuming our merger with spectrasite inc occurred on january 1 2005 iusacell has been in default under certain of its debt obligations and involved in litigation with certain of its creditors while iusacell reported in january 2006 that it has reached an agreement in principle with its creditors to restructure its debt obligations if the restructuring is not completed iusacell files for bankruptcy or the creditor litigation has an adverse impact on iusacell’s overall liquidity it could interfere with iusacell’s ability to meet its operating obligations including rental payments under our leases with them 

  

we may not realize the intended benefits of our merger with spectrasite inc if we are unable to integrate spectrasite’s operations wireless communications tower portfolio customers and personnel in a timely and efficient manner which could adversely affect our business and the value of our class a common stock 

  

achieving the benefits of our merger with spectrasite inc depends in part on the integration of our operations wireless communications tower portfolios and personnel with those of spectrasite in a timely and efficient manner and the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated synergies from this integration integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among others the size of spectrasite’s wireless communications tower portfolio and because spectrasite’s and our internal systems and processes were developed without regard to such integration our successful integration with spectrasite requires coordination of different personnel which may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and differences in policies procedures and operations between the companies and the different geographical locations of the companies our successful integration also requires attention to and maintenance of our business relationships with current customers which if compromised would result in disruptions to our business if we cannot successfully integrate spectrasite’s operations wireless communications tower portfolio customers and personnel we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger which could adversely affect the combined company’s business and could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock in addition the integration of our business with spectrasite may place a significant burden on management and its internal resources the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could harm our business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our class a common stock 

  

we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of spectrasite 

  

we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the business policies procedures operations and systems of spectrasite while we have integrated many of the companies’ systems and administrative activities to date we do not expect to complete our integration efforts until the second quarter of 2006 if we fail to meet the challenges involved in integrating the companies’ business and operations or we are unable to do so on a timely basis it could result in substantial additional expenses and harm to the combined company these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the businesses 

  

new technologies could make our tower leasing business less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues 

  

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the use and need for towerbased wireless services transmission and reception and have the effect of decreasing demand for tower space examples of such technologies include technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as lowerrate vocoders which can increase the capacity at existing sites and reduce the number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base in addition the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites could adversely affect demand for our antenna space the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws 

  

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of many thousands of real estate sites underlying our towers we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws including amounts we expect to pay the epa pursuant to the facilities audit agreement is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

  

we are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation of our business including regulation by the faa the fcc the epa and osha both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television antennas and the fcc separately regulates transmitting devices operating on towers similar regulations exist in mexico brazil and other foreign countries regarding wireless communications and the operation of communications towers local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands and requirements existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations these factors could adversely affect our operations 

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may adversely affect us 

  

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors are in weak financial condition or may have lower return on investment criteria than we do competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income 

  

in addition if we lose customers due to pricing we may not be able to find new customers leading to an accompanying adverse effect on our profitability increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly 

  

our competition includes 

  

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

  

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to operate our towers and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites further we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms approximately 85 of the owned communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2005 are located on leased land approximately 85 of these sites are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of 2015 and beyond our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us 

  

if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated 

  

our communications site portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers under these agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated for example our spectrasite subsidiary has entered into lease or sublease agreements with affiliates of sbc communications sbc with respect to approximately 2500 towers pursuant to which spectrasite has the option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2013 the aggregate purchase option price for the sbc towers was approximately 2824 million as of december 31 2005 and will accrete at a rate of 10 per year to the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site in addition we have entered into a similar agreement with alltel with respect to approximately 1776 towers for which we have an option to purchase the sites upon the expiration of the lease or sublease beginning in 2016 the aggregate purchase option price for the alltel towers was approximately 562 million as of december 31 2005 and will accrete at a rate of 3 per annum we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase these or other lease or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers which may have a material adverse effect on our business in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of such towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs and our financial results could be adversely affected 

  

our towers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage 

  

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen damage any damage or destruction to our towers 

  

as a result of these or other risks would impact our ability to provide services to our customers and could impact our results of operation and financial condition for example as a result of the severe hurricane activity in 2005 approximately 25 of our broadcast and wireless communications sites in the southeastern united states and mexico suffered material damage and many more suffered lesser damage while we maintain insurance including business interruption insurance for our towers against these risks we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction further such business interruption insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the damage if we are unable to provide services to our customers as a result of damages to our towers it could lead to customer loss resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

  

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions posed health risks to consumers it could negatively impact the market for wireless services as well as our wireless carrier customers which would adversely effect our operations costs and revenues we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

  

the bankruptcy proceeding of our verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties 

  

our wholly owned subsidiary verestar inc filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in december 2003 if verestar fails to honor certain of its contractual obligations because of its bankruptcy filing or otherwise claims may be made against us for breaches by verestar of those contracts as to which we are primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor which we do not expect to exceed 32 million in addition in july 2005 the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the bankruptcy proceeding the committee filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york against us and certain of our and verestar’s current and former officers directors and advisors and also filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court against us the case initially filed in the district court has since been transferred to the bankruptcy court and both cases are now pending as a single consolidated case before the same bankruptcy judge pursuant to the complaints the committee is seeking unspecified compensatory damages of not less than 1500 million punitive damages and various costs and fees the outcome of this complex litigation cannot be predicted by us with certainty is dependent upon many factors beyond our control and could take several years to resolve if any such claims are successful however they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for more information regarding the verestar bankruptcy and related litigation please see item 3 of this annual report under the caption “legal proceedings” and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

 item 3 legal   proceedings tableend   

as previously reported our verestar inc verestar subsidiary filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in december 2003 in connection with the bankruptcy filing we asserted certain claims against verestar as an unsecured creditor in june 2004 the bankruptcy court approved a stipulation between verestar and the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the bankruptcy proceeding the committee that permits the committee to file claims on behalf of verestar against us our affiliates and certain of our and verestar’s current and former officers and directors the committee requested and received authorization from the bankruptcy court to take discovery of us and certain of verestar’s current and former officers and directors we produced various documents and a limited number of depositions were conducted by the committee in july 2005 the committee filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york against us and certain of our and verestar’s current and former officers directors and advisors and also filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court against us the case initially filed in the district court has since been transferred to the bankruptcy court and both cases are now pending as a single consolidated case before the same bankruptcy judge we may be obligated or may agree to indemnify certain of the defendants named in the litigation the complaint originally filed in the district court asserts various causes of action against the defendants including declaratory judgment for alter ego breach of fiduciary duty conversion conspiracy tortious interference with contract and business relations deepening insolvency and avoidance and recovery of fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers in connection with those claims the committee is seeking unspecified compensatory damages of not less than 1500 million punitive damages and various costs and fees the complaint originally filed in the bankruptcy court includes an objection to our claims against verestar and seeks to recharacterize and equitably subordinate those claims that complaint also seeks substantive consolidation of our assets and liabilities with verestar’s assets and liabilities during 2005 the company together with the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss certain claims asserted in the complaints in february 2006 the bankruptcy court heard oral arguments on the motions to dismiss but has not yet decided any of the motions the outcome of this complex litigation cannot be predicted by us with certainty is dependent upon many factors beyond our control and could take several years to resolve in the opinion of management the resolution of the claims made against us by the committee will not likely have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

as previously disclosed in june 2005 the antitrust division of the department of justice issued civil investigative demands relating to our merger with spectrasite inc seeking information and documents from both us and spectrasite the antitrust division has the authority to require divestitures of assets by us and to seek to impose restrictions on our conduct of business following the merger to address alleged competitive concerns we and spectrasite cooperated with the antitrust division to provide the requested information and documents and on october 24 2005 the antitrust division notified us that it had closed its investigation of the merger 

  

the company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business in the opinion of company management after consultation with counsel other than the litigation related to the verestar bankruptcy discussed above there are no matters currently pending which would in the event of adverse outcome have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures in our financial statements actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates” on page 41 

  

our continuing operations are reported in two business segments rental and management and network development services management focuses on segment profit loss as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments we define segment operating profit loss as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense corporate general administrative and development expense and impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense segment profit loss for the rental and management segment includes interest income tv azteca net see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

executive overview 

  

our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment which accounted for approximately 984 and 969 of our total revenues and approximately 995 and 993 of our segment operating profit for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases leasing additional space on our existing towers acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled we continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity in addition we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadbandservices customers 

  

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of fivetoten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods in addition most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally threetofive percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straightline basis over the noncancelable term of the applicable agreement 

  

the revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically may not be cancelled or in some instances may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee accordingly lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment during 2005 tenant leases representing less than 2 of our total revenues were cancelled 

  

a significant majority of our revenue growth in 2005 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and inbuilding systems acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc in august 2005 we completed our merger with spectrasite inc an owner and operator of approximately 7800 wireless and broadcast towers and inbuilding systems in the united states the merger was approved by our and spectrasite’s stockholders on august 3 2005 and the results of operations of spectrasite have been included in 

  

our consolidated results of operations since that date during the period august 3 2005 through december 31 2005 spectrasite generated total revenues of 1712 million and operating profit of 1068 million 

  

our revenue growth in 2005 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites during 2005 incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between january 1 2004 and december 31 2005 was approximately 633 million which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rate changes offset by lease cancellations 

  

our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and to a lesser extent the location of and available capacity on our existing sites this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital and general economic conditions we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our yearoveryear revenue growth in 2006 

  

we also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites in addition to the approximately 7800 towers and inbuilding systems acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc we constructed or acquired 289 and 275 sites in 2005 and 2004 respectively because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition which affects yearoveryear comparisons during 2005 revenue attributable to these 564 sites that were built or acquired between january 1 2004 and december 31 2005 was approximately 108 million 

  

our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories direct tower level expenses and selling general and administrative expenses our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance and utilities our selling general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments such as sales and property management functions and are included in our rental and management and network development services segment operating expenses these segment level expenses exclude corporate general and administrative expenses which are included in corporate general administrative and development expense in general our segment level selling general and administrative expenses do not increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year as a result leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow our profit margin growth is therefore directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period 

  

results of operations 

  

years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 

  

   

total revenues 

  

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 were 9448 million an increase of 2381 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 1712 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by spectrasite the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of 741 million partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of 72 million 

  

rental and management revenue 

  

rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 9298 million an increase of 2453 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 1712 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by spectrasite approximately 633 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between january 1 2004 and december 31 2005 which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites existing 

  

tenants adding more equipment to those sites contractual escalators net of straightline accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates offset by lease cancellations approximately 108 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2004 other than in connection with the spectrasite merger we believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers 

  

network development services revenue 

  

network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 150 million a decrease of 72 million from year ended december 31 2004 the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition zoning and permitting services primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with spectrasite inc as we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business and offer only limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues 

  

total operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2005 were 8016 million an increase of 1647 million from the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation amortization and accretion expense of 818 million an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of 688 million an increase in corporate general administrative and development expense of 105 million and an increase in impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets restructuring and merger related expense of 104 million these increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of 68 million we expect our total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2006 to increase by approximately 350 million to 380 million related to the january 1 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r regarding equity–based compensation expense as described below in “—recent accounting pronouncements” 

  

rental and management expensesegment profit 

  

rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2005 was 3061 million an increase of 688 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 644 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by spectrasite the balance of the increase resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the approximately 560 communications sites acquired andor constructed since january 1 2004 other than in connection with the spectrasite merger due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2005 

  

rental and management segment profit for the year ended december 31 2005 was 6378 million an increase of 1764 million from the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 1068 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment profit generated by spectrasite the balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of january 1 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2004 other than in connection with the spectrasite merger and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates 

  

network development services expense

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net 

  

as of december 31 2005 we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” fin no 47 as a result we recognized a 355 million charge net of an 117 million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 the 

  

adoption of fin no 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations as fin no 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment net of 669 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other longterm obligations of 1140 million

of subsequent to january 1 2003 in 2004 our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning january 1 2003 and ending december 31 2004 was approximately 51 million we believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we improved our financial flexibility by refinancing our existing debt with less restrictive lower cost capital which increased our liquidity and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant transactions included the following 

  

   

   

   

as of december 31 2005 we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately 36 billion we incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of 

  

tower sites and services businesses and capital expenditures related to the construction of new tower sites beginning in 2002 we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness in 2003 2004 and 2005 we continued this effort by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility and since 2004 by using cash flow from operations to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt to reduce our net total indebtedness 

  

in 2005 we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations we believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending december 31 2006 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2006 for information about our outstanding indebtedness see “—contractual obligations” below 

  

we expect our 2006 cash needs related to indebtedness outstanding as of december 31 2005 to consist primarily of the following debt service including cash interest of approximately 1890 million approximately 1795 million for the february 1 2006 redemption of the remaining outstanding ati 1225 notes and capital lease payments and other notes payable including interest of approximately 52 million we expect to fund capital expenditures of between 1100 and 1300 million principally related to new tower construction improvements to existing towers and installation of new inbuilding systems in 2006 we also expect to use approximately 227 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares of atc south america that we do not own as discussed above in “business—recent transactions—atc international transactions” in addition we expect to continue to fund our stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional 6734 million of our class a common stock in 2006 we also may fund additional purchases of our class a common stock either pursuant to or supplemental to our stock repurchase program we expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

uses of cash 

  

stock repurchase program in november 2005 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 7500 million of our class a common stock through december 2006 we expect to utilize cash from operations borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to fund the repurchase program under the program our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors to facilitate repurchases we entered into a trading plan under rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of 1934 which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods the program may be discontinued at any time as of december 31 2005 we had repurchased 28 million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate of 766 million between january 1 2006 and march 9 2006 we repurchased an additional 39 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate of 1174 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers 

  

restrictions under credit facilities the american tower and spectrasite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions including limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply 

  

   

   

as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests 

  

any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the american tower credit facility or the spectrasite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the 

  

revolving loans but would constitute a default resulting in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable the credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and provided certain conditions are met permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval 

  

restrictions under notes indentures the indenture governing the terms of the ati 725 notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ati the sister guarantors as defined and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the american tower credit facility these include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments spectrasite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ati 725 notes and are not subject to such restrictions any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically the indenture restricts ati the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock other than debt under the american tower credit facility or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings up to 16 billion 

  

the indentures governing the terms of our 750 notes and 7125 notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments spectrasite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 750 notes and 7125 notes and are not subject to such restrictions any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow we are permitted however to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities 

  

if a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 

  

as of december 31 2005 our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately 3738 million 4571 million 1790 million 1787 million 18 billion and 18 billion respectively in addition as a holding company we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries or funds raised through debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ati 725 notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances accordingly if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance such debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which is subject to many factors beyond our control as outlined above in item 1a of this annual report under the caption “risk factors” in addition our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies which are dependent on our expected financial performance the liquidity factors discussed above and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or if such refinancings are obtained that the terms will be commercially reasonable 

  

capital markets  our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on among other things general economic conditions conditions of the wireless industry our financial performance and the state of the capital markets in april 2004 the sec declared effective our “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to 10 billion of debt andor equity securities as of december 31 2005 we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to income taxes purchase price allocation asset retirement obligations impairment of assets and revenue recognition management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result for a discussion of our other accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning on page f7 

  

   

we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses in june 2003 and october 2003 we filed federal income tax refund claims with the irs relating to the carry back of 3800 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003 of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately 900 million based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately 650 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006 there can be no assurances however with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund 

  

the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax 

  

assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 13 billion in taxable income from january 1 2006 to december 31 2025 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 

  

from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded a 295 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2005 

  

depending on the resolution of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in verestar no income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings 

  

   

   

as of december 31 2005 we adopted the provisions of fin no 47 and recognized a 355 million charge net of an 117 million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 this adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately 1140 million to 1642 million as of december 31 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment net of 669 million the adoption of fin no 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions as fin no 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in 

  

determining our settlement date assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating the company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

  

   

assets subject to depreciation and amortization and noncore longlived assets held for sale we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment whenever events changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows as well as through other analytical methods if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 

  

goodwill—assets not subject to amortization we perform our annual goodwill impairment test on december 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired in december 2005 2004 and 2003 we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information changes to which could affect those fair value estimates our december 2005 annual impairment testing included 15 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with spectrasite inc 

  

   

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123r sfas 123r revises sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” this statement addressed the accounting for sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options under the new standard companies will no longer be able to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance 

  

with apb no 25 instead companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fairvalue method and recognize the related expense associated with sharebased payments in the statement of operations sfas 123r is effective for us as of january 1 2006 we have historically accounted for sharebased payments to employees under apb no 25’s intrinsic value method as such we generally have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r under the modified prospective method in which compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas 123r and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas 123r is recognized based on sfas 123 tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for sharebased payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost we estimate that we will recognize equitybased compensation expense of approximately 35 million to 38 million for the year ending december 31 2006 this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006 including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on among other factors future employee stock option exercises due to the our tax loss position there was no operating cash inflow realized for december 31 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions 

  

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 107 regarding the staff’s interpretation of sfas 123r this interpretation provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between sfas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas 123r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no 107 in connection with our adoption of sfas 123r

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on longterm debt obligations we attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments namely interest rate swaps and caps all derivative financial instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading during the year ended december 31 2005 we repurchased redeemed and converted 6057 million face amount of outstanding debt securities for 5017 million in cash including the repurchase of 2706 million face amount 1778 million accreted value of ati 1225 notes the redemption of 2749 million principal amount of 9 3  8  notes and the conversion of 571 million principal amount of 325 notes in connection with our merger with spectrasite inc we also assumed 7025 million of debt at fair value consisting primarily of borrowings outstanding under the previous spectrasite credit facility

changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt comprised of 14930 million under our credit facilities as of december 31 2005 a 10 increase or approximately 47 basis points in current interest rates would have caused an additional pretax charge our net loss and an increase in our cash outflows of 70 million for the year ended december 31 2005

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us including our consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors 

  

our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the requisite time periods 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 

  

our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 as discussed in item 1 of this annual report under the caption “business” and in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report we completed our merger with spectrasite inc in august 2005 as permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec we excluded spectrasite from our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 the total assets and revenues of spectrasite included in our consolidated financial statements were approximately 14 and 18 respectively as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

in making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control—integrated framework  based on this assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2005 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

  

deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this annual report has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting such attestation which expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is included in this item 9a under the caption “report of independent registered public accounting firm” 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2005 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting as set forth above we excluded spectrasite from our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter and year ended december 31 2005 we consider the merger with spectrasite material to our results of operations financial position and cash flows and we are in the process of integrating the internal control procedures of spectrasite into our internal control structure 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of 

american tower corporation 

boston massachusetts 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that american tower corporation and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at spectrasite inc which was acquired on august 8 2005 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 14 and 18 respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at spectrasite inc the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of the company and our report dated march 14 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the company’s adoption of fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations—an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” effective december 31 2005

our tower portfolio provides us with a recurring base of leasing revenues from our existing customers and growth potential due to the capacity to add more tenants and equipment to these towers our broad network of towers enables us to address the needs of wireless service providers on a national basis we also offer select tower related services such as antennae and line installation and site acquisition and zoning services which are strategic to our core leasing business we intend to capitalize on the continuing increase in the use of wireless communication services by actively marketing space available for leasing on our existing towers and selectively developing or acquiring new towers that meet our return on investment criteria 

  

our core leasing business which we refer to as our rental and management segment accounted for approximately 984 and 966 of our segment operating profit for the years ended december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 respectively in 2004 we expect that our rental and management segment will contribute approximately 98 of our segment operating profit which we define as segment revenue less direct segment expense rental and management segment operating profit includes interest income tv azteca net – see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

an element of our strategy is to continue to focus our operations on our rental and management segment by divesting noncore assets and businesses using the proceeds to purchase high quality tower assets and reducing outstanding indebtedness between january 1 2003 and march 5 2004 we completed approximately 1239 million of noncore asset sales and have or will use the net proceeds to acquire new tower assets and to repay outstanding indebtedness we expect that we will generate approximately 100 million of additional net proceeds in 2004 from the sale of other noncore assets and intend to reinvest these proceeds in tower assets 

  

the sales proceeds described above include proceeds from the disposition of our remaining noncore services businesses including flash technologies galaxy engineering and kline iron  steel co inc kline with the divestiture of kline in march 2004 we have completed the transformation of our business to a focused tower leasing business with only limited services activities that directly support our core rental and management operations and the addition of new tenants on our towers 

  

we believe that our strategy of focusing operations on our rental and management segment will make our consolidated operating cash flows more stable provide us with continuing growth and enhance our returns on invested capital because of the following characteristics of our core leasing business 

  

   

   

   

   

strategy 

  

our strategy is to capitalize on the continued increase in the use of wireless communication services and the infrastructure requirements necessary to deploy current and future generations of wireless communication technologies between december 2001 and june 2003 the number of wireless phone subscribers in the united states increased from 1284 million to 1481 million representing an increase of approximately 15 and market penetration of approximately 51 at june 30 2003 from december 2001 through june 2003 the number of cell sites ie the number of antennae and related equipment in commercial operation not the number of towers on which that equipment is located also increased from 127500 to 147700 with respect to mexico the number of wireless phone subscribers increased from approximately 215 million at the end of 2001 to approximately 304 million at the end of 2003 representing an increase of approximately 41 and market penetration of approximately 30 at december 31 2003 we expect that the continued growth of subscribers for wireless personal communications and phone services will require wireless carriers to add a significant number of additional cell sites to maintain the performance of their networks in the areas they currently cover and to extend service to areas where coverage does not yet exist in addition we believe that as data wireless services such as email internet access and video are deployed on a widespread basis the deployment of these technologies will require wireless carriers to further increase the cell density of their existing networks may require an overlay of new technology equipment and may increase the demand for geographic expansion of their network coverage to meet this demand we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their tower infrastructure needs as a means of improving existing service coverage implementing new technology accelerating access to their markets and preserving capital rather than constructing and operating their own towers and maintaining their own tower service and development capabilities 

  

we believe that our existing portfolio of towers our tower related services and network development capabilities and our management team position us to benefit from these communication trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters the key elements of our strategy include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

products and services 

  

we operate in two business segments rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below 

  

our primary business is our leasing business which we refer to as our rental and management segment and which accounted for approximately 984 of our segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2003 we also offer tower related services through our network development services segment that are strategic to our rental and management segment 

  

prior to december 2002 we also operated a satellite and fiber network access services segment through our verestar inc subsidiary verestar in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of this business and in december 2003 verestar and its affiliates filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws accordingly we have accounted for verestar as a discontinued operation through the date of the bankruptcy filing and we ceased to consolidate verestar’s financial results as of that date see “– factors that may affect future results – the bankruptcy proceeding of our verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties” 

  

  

rental and management 

  

leasing of antennae sites  our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications towers to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies we operate a tower network of approximately 15000 multiuser sites in the united states mexico and brazil including more than 300 broadcast tower sites our networks in the united states and mexico are national in scope our us network spans 49 states and the district of columbia in addition 85 of our us network provides coverage in the top 100 markets or core areas such as high traffic interstate corridors giving effect to pending transactions our mexican network includes more than 1800 sites in highly populated areas including mexico city monterrey guadalajara and acapulco our brazilian network consists of approximately 425 towers which are primarily located in sao paulo rio de janeiro and curitiba 

  

we lease antenna space on our towers to tenants in a diverse range of wireless communications and broadcast industries wireless industries we serve primarily include personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio paging and fixed microwave our major domestic customers include alltel att wireless services cingular wireless nextel sprint pcs tmobile usa and verizon wireless and their respective affiliates our major international customers include iusacell celular nextel mexico telefonica moviles and unefon in mexico and nextel brazil telecom americas and telecom italia mobile in brazil our largest customer is verizon wireless which represented approximately 12 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 no other customer accounted for greater than 10 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 approximately 62 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 were derived from eight customers see “–factors that may affect future results – a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers” and “due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the credit worthiness of its tenants” 

  

the number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the tower’s location height and the structural capacity at certain wind speeds an antenna’s height on a tower and the tower’s location determine the lineofsight of the antenna with the horizon and consequently the distance a signal can be transmitted some of our customers such as personal communications services enhanced specialized mobile radio providers and cellular companies in metropolitan areas typically do not place their equipment at the highest tower point other customers including paging companies and specialized mobile radio providers in rural areas prefer higher elevations for broader coverage we believe that a significant majority of our towers have the capacity to add additional tenants 

  

lease terms  our leases like most of those in the tower industry generally vary depending upon the region and the industry user initial terms for television and radio broadcast leases typically range between fifteen and twenty years while leases for wireless communications providers generally have initial terms of five to ten years in both cases the leases often have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant both wireless carriers and broadcasters generally renew their leases with us repositioning an antenna in a wireless carrier’s network is expensive and often requires reconfiguring several other antennae in the carrier’s network and may require the carrier to obtain other governmental permits 

  

most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these automatic increases are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation 

  

annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon 

  

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

  

tower development historically cellular and other wireless service providers had constructed and owned a majority of the towers for their own antennae needs rather than leasing space on towers from a third party beginning in the late 1990s wireless service providers expressed a growing interest in having independent companies own and operate the towers for their antennae due to the relatively high capital costs and operating expenses for a single carrier’s use this trend resulted in our entering into agreements with a number of wireless carriers to construct and subsequently lease space on towers in key areas identified as optimal for their network expansion requirements in most cases because we own the constructed towers we are able to lease space on them to other tenants as well as to the original tenant 

  

network development services 

  

we provide the following towerrelated services that are strategic to our rental and management segment 

  

antennae and line installation and construction services we are one of the leading providers of construction services for wireless communication and broadcast towers we provide construction services for our own account and for sites owned by third parties as part of our network development services we provide antennae and line installation and maintenance services for wireless communication towers and broadcast towers these services use not only our constructionrelated skills but also our technical expertise to ensure that new installations do not cause interference with other tenants we believe that our antennae and line installation services and maintenance capabilities provide us with a significant opportunity to capture incremental revenue on existing and newly built sites 

  

site acquisition and zoning services  we engage in site acquisition services for our own account in connection with tower development projects and other proprietary construction as well as for third parties we typically work with our customers’ network design engineers to determine the geographic areas where the applicable customer needs a tower site to address its coverage objectives once a site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site under applicable law 

  

other services and infrastructure  at the beginning of 2003 part of our network development services segment included network engineering services through our galaxy engineering division and steel fabrication and tall tower design and construction services through our kline subsidiary in august 2003 we sold our galaxy engineering division and in june 2003 we committed to a plan to sell kline which was sold in march 2004 accordingly the results of operations of these businesses are accounted for as discontinued operations and are not included in our network development services segment 

  

recent transactions 

  

acquisitions 

  

nii holdings inc  in december 2002 we agreed to acquire over 500 communications sites from nii holdings nii predominantly in mexico for an aggregate purchase price of 1000 million in cash as of december 31 2003 we had satisfied our minimum purchase obligation under the agreement and had acquired an aggregate of 665 towers in mexico and brazil from nii for a total purchase price of 1124 million we have the option to purchase additional tower sites from nii in mexico and brazil through 2007 and currently plan to acquire an additional 24 sites in mexico in the second quarter of 2004 for approximately 44 million we expect to fund any additional closings using funds from operations and proceeds from asset dispositions 

  

iusacell celular in december 2003 we agreed to acquire up to 143 communications sites from iusacell celular in mexico for up to 314 million we acquired 34 of these towers in december for approximately 85 million and as of march 5 2004 we had acquired an additional 36 towers for approximately 76 million we expect to acquire the remaining towers by the end of the third quarter of 2004 we expect to fund any additional closings out of funds from operations and proceeds from asset dispositions 

  

dispositions 

  

from january 1 2003 through march 5 2004 we completed approximately 1239 million of noncore asset sales significant dispositions included the following 

  

noncore towers  we sold over 300 noncore tower assets previously included in our rental and management segment for approximately 370 million these dispositions are part of our program to actively manage our portfolio of tower assets by selling noncore towers and reinvesting a portion of the total proceeds in high quality tower assets 

  

flash technologies in january 2003 we sold flash technologies our lighting systems business previously included in our network development services segment for net cash proceeds of approximately 355 million 

  

mtn  in february 2003 verestar sold its subsidiary maritime telecommunications network mtn for approximately 255 million in cash the net proceeds from the sale were used by verestar to repay loans as required under the credit facilities 

  

office buildings  in march 2003 we sold an office building for approximately 103 million in may 2003 we sold an office building for approximately 185 million including 24 million in cash proceeds and the buyer’s assumption of 161 million of related mortgage notes these buildings were held primarily as rental property in our rental and management segment 

  

galaxy engineering in august 2003 we sold galaxy engineering a radio frequency engineering network design and towerrelated consulting business previously included in our network development services segment we received approximately 20 million in cash at closing and will receive an additional 15 million payable on or before january 15 2008 

  

kline iron  steel in march 2004 we sold substantially all the net assets of kline for approximately 40 million in cash subject to a post closing working capital adjustment and we may receive up to an additional 20 million in cash payable in 2006 based on the revenues generated by kline in 2005 kline was previously included in our network development services segment we expect to sell the remaining assets of kline which primarily include an office building manufacturing facility and related real estate by june 30 2004 

  

atc mexico holding corp 

  

in january 2004 j michael gearon jr one of our executive officers exercised his previously disclosed right to require us to purchase his 87 interest in atc mexico holding corp atc mexico we currently own an 88 interest in atc mexico which is the subsidiary through which we conduct our mexico operations the 

  

purchase price for mr gearon’s interest in atc mexico is subject to review by an independent financial advisor and is payable in cash or shares of our class a common stock at our option we intend to pay the purchase price in shares of our class a common stock and the closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2004 in addition we expect that payment of a portion of the purchase price will be contingent upon atc mexico meeting certain performance criteria 

  

the remaining 33 interest in atc mexico was reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted to certain employees under the atc mexico holding stock option plan these options became exercisable upon the exercise of mr gearon’s put right and were exercised in january 2004 the employees holding these shares also may require us to purchase their interest in atc mexico six months following their issuance which date will occur in july 2004 william h hess one of our executive officers owns a 14 interest in atc mexico as a result of his exercise of options granted to him under the atc mexico holding stock option plan 

  

management organization 

  

our corporate headquarters is in boston massachusetts in 2003 we streamlined our united states rental and management organization from three regions and ten areas to centralized management over seven areas each of our united states tower and services divisions are now led by a vice president who reports to our president us tower division who in turn reports to our chief executive officer our united states tower and services divisions are now centrally located in boston and atlanta respectively and are further subdivided into seven area operations centers that are staffed with skilled engineering construction management and marketing personnel our centralized lease processing for the rental and management segment is based in woburn massachusetts and our related accounting operations are based in atlanta georgia our international regional centers are based in mexico city mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe our united states and international regional and area operations centers are capable of responding effectively to the opportunities and customer needs of their defined geographic areas 

  

regulatory matters 

  

towers and licenses both the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting these regulations govern the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers must be reviewed by the faa prior to initiation to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to aircraft navigation after the faa issues a “no hazard” determination the tower owner must register the tower with the fcc and paint and light the tower in accordance with the faa determination the faa review and the fcc registration processes are prerequisites to fcc authorization of communications devices placed on the tower tower owners bear the responsibility for notifying the faa of any tower lighting failures and for the repair of those lighting failures tower owners also must notify the fcc when ownership of a tower changes we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable standards failure to comply with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties 

  

the fcc separately regulates and licenses wireless communications devices and radio and television stations transmitting from the towers we hold through various subsidiaries certain private microwave licenses granted by the fcc we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to assigning these licenses or transferring control of any entity of ours which holds fcc licenses 

  

in january 2001 the fcc concluded investigations of several operators of communications towers including us the fcc sent us a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture “nal” preliminarily determining that we had failed to file certain informational forms had failed to properly post certain information at various tower sites and on one occasion had failed to properly light a tower the fcc also ordered an additional review of our overall procedures for and degree of compliance with the fcc’s regulations we reached a settlement with 

  

the fcc regarding the compliance issues arising out of the nal in the form of a consent decree as part of the consent decree the fcc rescinded the nal and terminated the further investigation ordered in the nal in september 2001 we made a voluntary contribution of 03 million to the us treasury and agreed to maintain an active compliance plan failure to comply with the consent decree may lead to additional monetary penalties and loss of the right to hold our various registrations and licenses the consent decree expires in august 2004 

  

the fcc considers the construction of a new tower or collocation of an antenna on an existing antenna structure including building rooftops and watertanks to be a federal undertaking subject to prior environmental review and approval under the national environmental policy act of 1969 “nepa” which obligates federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of undertakings to determine whether they may significantly affect the environment the fcc has issued regulations implementing nepa as well as the national historic preservation act and the endangered species act “esa” these regulations place responsibility on each fcc applicant or licensee to investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower or collocating an antenna if a tower or collocation may have a significant impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or collocation could be significantly delayed 

  

in august 2002 certain environmental groups asked the fcc to review the tower registrations of more than 5000 towers in the gulf coast region to assess compliance with the esa and migratory bird treaty act and to require the filing of new or revised environmental assessments under nepa for all towers in the region we own a number of the towers identified in the pleading however because the pleading was not served on us we have not been asked by the fcc to respond pcia a trade association representing the tower industry has asked the fcc to dismiss the pleading based on numerous grounds the matter is pending in february 2003 the same environmental groups filed suit against the fcc in a federal appeals court asking the court to force the fcc to address the groups’ pending requests and appeals and asked the court to force the fcc to adopt more stringent environmental rules depending on how the court rules we could be subject to increased compliance obligations in addition a ruling in the federal appeals court could affect the groups’ pending cases with the fcc 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by limiting state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of wireless communications towers the law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations the telecommunications act of 1996 also requires the federal government to help licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for towers 

  

we are also subject to local and county zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or collocations on existing towers local zoning authorities often are in opposition to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction collocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition those regulations increase costs associated with new tower construction and collocation existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction and collocations and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could adversely affect our construction program and operations 

  

our tower operations in mexico and brazil are also subject to regulation if we pursue additional international opportunities we will be subject to regulations in additional foreign jurisdictions in addition our customers both domestic and foreign also may be subject to new regulatory policies that may adversely affect the demand for communications sites 

  

satellite and fiber network access services discontinued operations our verestar subsidiary is required to obtain licenses and other authorizations from the fcc for its use of radio frequencies to provide satellite and wireless services in the united states verestar also is required to obtain authorizations from foreign regulatory agencies in connection with its provision of these services abroad verestar also holds a number of pointtopoint microwave radio licenses that are used to provide telecommunications services additionally verestar holds a number of satellite earth station licenses in connection with its operation of satellitebased networks we and verestar are required to obtain consent from the fcc prior to assigning these licenses or transferring control of any of our companies holding an fcc license 

  

environmental matters our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under those laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination 

  

we and our customers also may be required to obtain permits obey regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances used at our sites by our customers violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines andor criminal sanctions in october 2001 we paid 150000 in civil penalties and entered into a settlement agreement that expires in 2006 related to certain alleged environmental permitting and filing violations in the county of santa clara in california 

  

health safety and transportation as an fcc licensee we are subject to regulations and guidelines imposing certain operational obligations relating to radio frequency emissions as an employer we are subject to the occupational safety and health act and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure our construction teams are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent state agencies concerning health and safety matters our heavy vehicles and their drivers are subject to regulation by the department of transportation “dot” our dot compliance program is currently rated “satisfactory” the highest rating assigned by the dot 

  

competition 

  

rental and management segment 

  

we compete for antennae site customers with other national tower companies such as crown castle international corp spectrasite inc and sba communications corp wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks and lease tower space to other carriers numerous independent tower owners and the owners of nontower sites including rooftops water towers and other alternative structures we believe that tower location and capacity price and quality of service historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

  

the emergence or growth of new technologies also may make it possible for wireless carriers to expand their use of existing infrastructure which could reduce customer demand for our communications sites the increased use of capacity enhancing technologies such as lowerrate vocoders and more spectrally efficient airlink standards which potentially can relieve some network capacity problems could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space 

  

any increase in the use of network sharing or roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers also could adversely affect the demand for tower space these arrangements which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements enable a provider to serve customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers such as the recently announced transaction between cingular wireless and att wireless could have a similar impact on customer demand for our tower sites because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap although we do not expect the cingularatt wireless transaction to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations significant consolidation among wireless carriers may adversely affect demand for our tower sites and accordingly our revenues and cash flows 

  

network development services segment competition our network development services compete with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our customers’ internal staffs we believe that our customers base their decisions on network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project 

  

we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our rental and management and network development services segments 

  

construction manufacturing and raw materials 

  

we build maintain and install landbased wireless communications and broadcast transmitting and receiving facilities by obtaining steel and other raw material parts and components from a variety of vendors we also engage third party contract manufacturers to construct certain of these facilities we have historically obtained the majority of our raw material parts and components from a limited number of suppliers however substantially all of these items are available from numerous other suppliers we have not to date experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining the needed quantities of materials from suppliers in a timely manner 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 we employed approximately 1400 fulltime individuals including approximately 250 employees in our deconsolidated verestar subsidiary and approximately 80 employees in our discontinued kline subsidiary and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

factors that may affect future results 

  

decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

  

many of the factors affecting the demand for wireless communications tower space and to a lesser extent our network development services business could materially affect our operating results those factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the demand for broadcast antenna space is dependent to a significantly lesser extent on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission we could also be affected adversely should the development of digital television be further delayed or impaired or if demand for it were less than anticipated because of delays disappointing technical performance or cost to the consumer 

  

substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

  

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 34 billion of consolidated debt 

  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness approximately 21 of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 

  

our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and indentures could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

  

our credit facilities and the indentures governing the terms of our other debt securities contain restrictive covenants and in the case of the credit facilities requirements that we comply with certain leverage and other financial tests these limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness issuing preferred stock engaging in various types of transactions including mergers and sales of assets and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments including investments these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisition or other opportunities 

  

our participation or inability to participate in tower industry consolidation could involve certain risks 

  

we believe there are benefits to consolidation among tower companies and have in the past and may in the future explore merger or acquisition transactions with one or more other companies in our industry any merger or acquisition transaction would involve several risks to our business including demands on managerial personnel that could divert their attention from other aspects of our core leasing business increased operating risks due to the integration of major national networks into our operational system and potential antitrust constraints either in local markets or on a regional basis that could require selective divestitures at unfavorable prices any completed transaction may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following its completion while we integrate the operations of the other business in addition once integrated combined operations may not necessarily achieve the levels of revenues profitability or productivity anticipated there also may be limitations on our ability to consummate a merger or acquisition transaction for example any transaction would have to comply with the terms of our credit facilities and note indentures or may require the consent of lenders under those instruments that might be required that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms in addition regulatory constraints might impede or prevent business combinations our inability to consummate a merger or acquisition for these or other reasons could result in our failure to participate in the expected benefits of industry consolidation and may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively 

  

if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers such as the recently announced transaction between cingular wireless and att wireless may result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap as do their expansion plans similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antennae space in january 2003 the federal communications commission fcc eliminated its spectrum cap which prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area expired the fcc has also eliminated the crossinterest rule 

  

for metropolitan areas which limited an entity’s ability to own interests in multiple cellular licenses in an overlapping geographical service area also in may 2003 the fcc adopted new rules authorizing wireless radio services holding exclusive licenses to freely lease unused spectrum some wireless carriers may be encouraged to consolidate with each other as a result of these regulatory changes as a means to strengthen their financial condition consolidation among wireless carriers would also increase our risk that the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially decrease revenues and cash flows 

  

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants 

  

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage during the past two years several of our customers have filed for bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues in addition iusacell celular which is our largest customer in mexico and accounted for approximately 47 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 and approximately 37 for the year ended december 31 2002 is currently in default under its debt obligations if one or more of our major customers experience financial difficulties or if iusacell files for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and our loss of significant customers and anticipated lease revenues 

  

our foreign operations are subject to expropriation risk governmental regulation funds inaccessibility and foreign exchange exposure 

  

our expansion in mexico and brazil and any other possible foreign operations in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the united states we have loaned 1198 million undiscounted to a mexican company own or have the economic rights to over 1800 towers in mexico including approximately 200 broadcast towers after giving effect to pending transactions and subject to certain rejection rights are contractually committed to construct up to approximately 400 additional towers in that country over the next three years we also own or have acquired the rights to approximately 425 communications towers in brazil and are subject to certain rejection rights contractually committed to construct up to 350 additional towers in that country over the next three years the actual number of sites constructed will vary depending on the build out plans of the applicable carrier we may if economic and capital market conditions permit also engage in comparable transactions in other countries in the future among the risks of foreign operations are governmental expropriation and regulation the credit quality of our customers inability to repatriate earnings or other funds currency fluctuations difficulty in recruiting trained personnel and language and cultural differences all of which could adversely affect our operations 

  

a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers 

  

a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers approximately 615 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 were derived from eight customers our largest domestic customer is verizon wireless which represented approximately 123 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 if the recently announced transaction between cingular wireless and att wireless had occurred as of january 1 2003 however the combined revenues would have represented approximately 150 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 our largest international customer is a group of companies affiliated with azteca holdings sa de cv including tv azteca unefon and due to its acquisition in 2003 by movil access an affiliate of azteca holdings iusacell celular iusacell celular unefon and their affiliates collectively represented approximately 75 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition we received 142 million in interest income net for the year ended december 31 2003 from tv azteca if any of these customers were unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we also sometimes experience disputes with our customers generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our agreements although historically we have resolved most of these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on our company or our customer relationships these disputes could lead to a termination of our agreements with customers or a material modification of the terms of those agreements either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our operating results 

  

new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues 

  

the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the use and need for towerbased wireless services transmission and reception and have the effect of decreasing demand for antenna space examples of such technologies include technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as lowerrate vocoders which can increase the capacity at existing sites and reduce the number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base in addition the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites could adversely affect demand for our antenna space the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree could have an adverse effect on our operations 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws 

  

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of approximately 15000 real estate sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

  

we are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation of our business including regulation by the federal aviation administration faa the fcc the environmental protection agency the department of transportation and the occupational safety and health administration both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television antennae and the fcc separately regulates transmitting devices operating on towers similar regulations exist in mexico brazil and other foreign countries regarding wireless communications and the operation of communications towers local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction collocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction and locations and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent or restrict new tower construction in certain locations these factors could adversely affect our operations 

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may adversely affect us 

  

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors are in weak financial condition or may have lower return on investment criteria than we do competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income 

  

in addition if we lose customers due to pricing we may not be able to replace these customers leading to an accompanying adverse effect on our profitability increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly 

  

our competition includes 

  

   

   

   

   

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

  

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive 

  

if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects including cancer were established or if the public perception that such a connection exists were to increase our operations costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

  

the bankruptcy proceeding of our verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties 

  

our wholly owned subsidiary verestar inc filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws on december 22 2003 verestar was reported as a discontinued operation in december 2002 for financial statement purposes and as of the date of the bankruptcy filing was deconsolidated for financial statement purposes 

  

if verestar fails to honor certain of its contractual obligations because of its bankruptcy filing or otherwise claims may be made against us for breaches by verestar of those contracts as to which we are primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor which we do not expect will exceed 100 million in addition verestar’s bankruptcy estate may bring certain claims against us or seek to hold us liable for certain transfers made by verestar to us andor for verestar’s obligations to creditors under various equitable theories recognized under bankruptcy law the outcome of complex litigation including those claims which may be asserted against us by verestar’s bankruptcy estate cannot be predicted with certainty and is dependent upon many factors beyond our control finally we will incur additional costs in connection with our involvement in the reorganization or liquidation of verestar’s business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures in our financial statements actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading “critical accounting policies and estimates” on page 38 

  

our continuing operations are reported in two segments rental and management and network development services management focuses on segment profit loss as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments we define segment operating profit loss as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization corporate general administrative and development expense and impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense segment profit loss for the rental and management segment includes interest income tv azteca net see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the consolidated statements of operations for periods presented in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” have been adjusted to reflect certain businesses as discontinued operations see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

executive overview 

  

our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment which accounted for approximately 867 and 807 of our total revenues and approximately 984 and 966 of our segment operating profit for the years ending december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases leasing additional space on our existing towers and acquiring and building additional tower sites we continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our strategic focus on our rental and management segment the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity in addition we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadbandservices customers 

  

the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years fifteen to twenty for broadcast tenants accordingly a significant majority of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december 2003 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods in addition most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the applicable agreement 

  

the primary factor affecting our ability to lease additional space on our existing towers is the rate at which wireless carriers choose to deploy capital to improve and expand their networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and the infrastructure needed to support these services the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital and general economic conditions in 2003 our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning january 1 2002 and ending december 31 2003 was approximately 500 million based on our understanding of our customers’ capital spending and network development plans we do not expect these trends will change materially in 2004 

  

in 2002 and 2003 we acquired or constructed 580 and 618 towers respectively because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above our results of operations only reflect revenues generated by the acquired and newly constructed tower sites following their respective dates of acquisition or construction which affects yeartoyear comparisons for the year ending december 31 2003 approximately 280 million of our revenue was attributable to towers that we acquired or constructed in 2002 and approximately 160 million of our revenue was attributable to towers that we acquired or constructed in 2003 

  

our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories direct tower level expenses and allocable selling general and administrative expenses our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent maintenance taxes and utilities because our operating expenses generally do not increase significantly when we add additional customers on a tower site leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow our profit margin growth is therefore directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period 

  

our selling general and administrative expenses have two major components the first component consists of expenses necessary to support our site leasing and network development services such as sales and property management functions the second component consists of expenses incurred to support all of our operations such as legal accounting human resources and other administrative support in connection with organizational initiatives in 2002 and 2003 to manage our operations more efficiently these expenses have decreased over these periods and we expect them to be relatively stable in 2004 

  

  

results of operations 

  

years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

  

   

total revenues 

  

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 were 7151 million an increase of 401 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of 748 million offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of 347 million 

  

rental and management revenue 

  

rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 was 6197 million an increase of 748 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase resulted primarily from adding additional broadband tenants to towers that existed as of january 1 2002 and to a lesser extent from revenue generated on the approximately 1200 towers acquired andor constructed subsequent to january 1 2002 

  

we continue to believe that our leasing revenue which drives our core business is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our expected increase in utilization of existing tower capacity in addition we believe that the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband type customers 

  

network development services revenue 

  

network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 was 954 million a decrease of 347 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the decline in revenues during 2003 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management installation and tower maintenance services resulting from lower levels of construction activity and reduced demand for related services in the wireless telecommunications industry 

  

total operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 were 6837 million a decrease of 1062 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the principal components of the decrease were attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of 296 million and a decrease in impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense of 697 million the remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in expenses within our rental and management segment of 41 million and a decrease in corporate general administrative and development expense of 34 million 

  

rental and management expensesegment profit 

  

rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2003 was 2227 million a decrease of 41 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in certain rental and management segment overhead costs partially offset by an increase in tower expenses related to the 1200 towers we have acquiredconstructed since january 1 2002 due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2003 

  

rental and management segment profit for the year ended december 31 2003 was 4112 million an increase of 791 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired andor constructed towers coupled with a net reduction in tower expenses as discussed above 

  

network development services expensesegment profit 

  

network development services expense for the year ended december 31 2003 was 889 million a decrease of 296 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment as discussed above partially offset by decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs 

  

network development services segment profit for the year ended december 31 2003 was 65 million a decrease of 51 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue as discussed above partially offset by expense reductions as discussed above 

  

corporate general administrative and development expense 

  

corporate general administrative and development expense for the year ended december 31 2003 was 269 million a decrease of 34 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense was 317 million for the year ended december 31 2003 during the year ended december 31 2003 we sold approximately 300 noncore towers and certain other noncore assets and recorded impairment charges to writedown certain other noncore towers and assets as a result we recorded impairment charges and net loss on sale of longlived assets of approximately 191 million we also wroteoff approximately 92 million of constructioninprogress costs primarily associated with sites we no longer planned to build lastly we incurred employee separation costs primarily associated with the reorganization of certain functions in our rental and management segment and facility closing costs aggregating 34 million 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense was 1014 million for the year ended december 31 2002 during the yearended december 31 2002 we sold approximately 720 noncore towers and recorded impairment charges to writedown certain other noncore towers which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately 468 million in september 2002 we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and as a result we wroteoff approximately 402 million of constructioninprogress costs for the year ended december 31 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build additionally in the latter stages of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 we announced a restructuring of our organization to include the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions as a result of these initiatives during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees primarily development and administrative as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs aggregating 106 million 

  

interest income 

  

interest income for the year ended december 31 2003 was 53 million an increase of 18 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on restricted cash and investments resulting principally from our 1225 senior subordinated discount notes offering in january 2003 and to a lesser extent our august 2003 equity offering 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2003 was 2799 million an increase of 254 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase resulted primarily from the following interest expense on our 1225 senior subordinated discount notes issued in january 2003 our 325 convertible notes issued in august 2003 the ati 725 senior subordinated notes issued in november 2003 the increase was partially offset by a net decrease in interest expense on our credit facilities as a result of repayments made during 2003 and to a lesser extent lower interest rates the increase was also partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our 225 and 50 convertible notes as a result of repurchases made during 2003 as discussed below 

  

  

loss on retirement of longterm obligations 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 we amended our credit facilities and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities as a result we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately 119 million related to the writeoff of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity we also repurchased certain of our 225 convertible and 50 convertible notes inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 225 convertible notes that expired on october 22 2003 throughout the year as a result we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately 343 million which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 225 convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 50 convertible notes the total of these charges 462 million represents our loss on retirement of longterm obligations for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

in february 2002 we repaid 950 million outstanding under our mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facilities as a result of such repayment for the year ended december 31 2002 we expensed approximately 17 million of deferred financing fees in addition in january 2002 we terminated the 2500 million multidraw term loan c component of our credit facilities and recorded a noncash charge of approximately 72 million related to the writeoff of related deferred financing fees the total of these charges 89 million represents our loss on retirement of longterm obligations for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

loss on investments and other expense 

  

loss on investments and other expense for the year ended december 31 2003 was 298 million an increase of 43 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the increase resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ati 1225 senior subordinated discount notes offering this increase was primarily offset by decreased foreign currency transaction losses we recorded impairment charges on our cost and equity investments as well as losses on our equity method investments aggregating 212 million and 203 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

income tax benefit 

  

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2003 was 661 million a decrease of 16 million from the year ended december 31 2002 the effective tax rate was 214 for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to 175 for the year ended december 31 2002 the primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of a 275 million valuation allowance that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back approximately 3800 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003 this strategy resulted in the filing of tax refund claims with the irs in 2003 in june 2003 we filed an income tax refund claim with the irs relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998 1999 and 2001 we filed a similar claim in october 2003 with respect to net operating losses generated in 2002 we anticipate receiving a refund of approximately 900 million as a result of these claims which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset we estimate recovery of these amounts within one to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the irs there can be no assurances however with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs incurred in connection with implementing this strategy this increase was offset in part by an increase in the valuation allowance in 2003 for capital losses and nondeductible losses on retirements of our convertible notes 

  

the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses foreign items and nondeductible losses on retirements of our convertible notes the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses foreign items and the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our tax planning strategy discussed above 

  

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized” at december 31 2003 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 1567 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with the tax refund claims we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twentyyear tax carryforward period 

  

we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2003 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 10 billion in taxable income from january 1 2004 to december 31 2023 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described below we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity 

  

loss from discontinued operations net 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to sell verestar by december 31 2003 in december 2003 verestar filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased to be included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in august 2003 we consummated the sale of galaxy in june 2003 we committed to a plan to sell kline by june 30 2004 in may 2003 we consummated the sale of an office building in westwood massachusetts in february 2003 pursuant to our original plan to sell verestar we sold mtn a subsidiary of verestar in january 2003 we sold flash technologies in march 2003 we consummated the sale of an office building in schaumburg illinois in december 2002 we consummated the sale of the building in boston massachusetts where we maintain our corporate headquarters finally in july 2002 we consummated the sale of mts components accordingly we have presented the results of these operations including those of verestar through the date of the bankruptcy filing approximately 125 million and 2452 million net of tax in loss from discontinued operations net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

in addition to the above loss from discontinued operations net for the year ended december 31 2003 includes the following a an aggregate impairment charge of 265 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain of verestar’s contracts for which we are primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor as of december 31 2003 b an aggregate noncash impairment charge of 146 million to reduce the carrying value of kline’s net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal c a 24 million net loss on the disposal of galaxy d a 36 million net loss on the disposal of the office building in westwood massachusetts e a 01 million net gain on the sale of flash technologies and f a 01 million net loss on the sale of the office building in schaumberg illinois loss from discontinued operations net for the year ended december 31 2002 includes an aggregate net loss on our disposition of mts components and two office buildings of approximately 135 million 

  

as of december 31 2003 the disposal of our kline business was still a pending transaction in march 2004 we sold substantially all the net assets of kline and expect to sell the remaining assets by june 30 2004

as of january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as a result we recognized a 5626 million noncash charge net of a tax benefit of 144 million as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the writedown of goodwill to its fair value the noncash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services segment 1893 million and network development services segment 3878 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the charge is reflected as of january 1 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

  

   

total revenues 

  

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 were 6751 million an increase of 201 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of 1139 million offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of 938 million 

  

rental and management revenue 

  

rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 5449 million an increase of 1139 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to january 1 2001 and to a lesser extent increased revenue on towers that existed as of january 1 2001 the 4270 towers that we have acquired and constructed since january 1 2001 have significantly increased our revenues the increased depth and strength of our national and international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of january 1 2001 this increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers 

  

network development services revenue 

  

network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 1302 million a decrease of 938 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the significant decline in revenues during 2002 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management installation and tower maintenance services resulting from a corresponding decrease in the growth of the wireless telecommunications industry 

  

total operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 were 7898 million a decrease of 684 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the principal component of the decrease was attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of 810 million the remaining components of the decrease were attributable to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of 221 million and a decrease in corporate general administrative and development expense of 41 million these decreases were offset by increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of 169 million coupled with an increase in impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense of 219 million 

  

rental and management expensesegment profit 

  

rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 2268 million an increase of 169 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 3700 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2001 due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2002 the balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 570 towers acquiredconstructed in 2002 these increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions 

  

rental and management segment profit for the year ended december 31 2002 was 3321 million an increase of 966 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers 

  

network development services expensesegment profit 

  

network development services expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 1186 million a decrease of 810 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment as discussed above coupled with decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs 

  

network development services segment profit for the year ended december 31 2002 was 116 million a decrease of 128 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue as discussed above partially offset by a reduction in personnel overhead and infrastructure costs as a result of restructuring initiatives that were implemented in 2002 and 2001 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2002 was 3129 million a decrease of 221 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease reflects the adoption of sfas no 142 which reduced amortization expense by approximately 676 million this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately 2369 million in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on the 14 billion of property and equipment acquired in 2001 

  

corporate general administrative and development expense 

  

corporate general administrative and development expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 302 million a decrease of 41 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease is attributable to cost reduction efforts in administrative and information technology functions related to our restructuring initiatives as well as a reduction in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense was 1014 million for the year ended december 31 2002 during the year ended december 31 2002 we sold approximately 720 noncore towers and recorded impairment charges to writedown certain other noncore towers which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately 468 million in september 2002 we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and as a result we wroteoff approximately 402 million of constructioninprogress costs for the year ended december 31 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build lastly during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees primarily development and administrative as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs aggregating 106 million 

  

impairments net loss on sale of longlived assets and restructuring expense was 795 million for the year ended december 31 2001 in november 2001 we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions this resulted in a significant decrease in new tower construction and more stringent criteria for evaluating tower construction and acquisitions as a result we wroteoff approximately 626 million of constructioninprogress costs for the year ended december 31 2001 associated with sites we no longer planned to build we also incurred impairment charges to writedown certain noncore towers of approximately 117 million during the year ended december 31 2001 lastly we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 525 employees primarily tower development and administrative as well as facility closing costs aggregating 52 million 

  

  

interest income 

  

interest income for the year ended december 31 2002 was 35 million a decrease of 249 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash primarily attributable to a decrease in cash on hand during 2002 coupled with lower interest rates 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 2544 million a decrease of 128 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the majority of the decrease 266 million resulted primarily from a reduction in the interest rates under our credit facilities the decrease was partially offset by an increase of 76 million related to a full year of interest incurred on our 9 3  8  senior notes issued in january 2001 and a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of our reduced capital expenditures in 2002 

  

  

loss on investments and other expense 

  

loss on investments and other expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 256 million a decrease of 132 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease resulted primarily from decreased impairment and equity losses on our cost and equity investments offset by increased losses on foreign currency exchange related to our mexican subsidiary 

  

loss from retirement of longterm obligations 

  

in february 2002 we repaid all amounts outstanding under our mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facility as a result of such repayment we expensed approximately 17 million of deferred financing fees in addition in january 2002 we terminated the 2500 million multidraw term loan c component of our credit facilities and recorded a noncash charge of approximately 72 million related to the writeoff of the related deferred financing fees the aggregate of these charges 89 million represents our loss on retirement of longterm obligations for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

during the year ended december 31 2001 we acquired a portion of our 225 convertible notes in exchange for shares of our class a common stock as a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders we recorded a loss on retirement of longterm obligations of 263 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this noncash charge represents the fair value of incremental stock issued to note holders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date 

  

income tax benefit 

  

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2002 was 678 million a decrease of 342 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the effective tax rate was 175 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 207 for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a valuation allowance of 275 million that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back certain federal net operating losses the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing such strategy this decrease is offset by the impact of our ceasing to amortize goodwill the majority of which is nondeductible for tax purposes in 2002 in connection with the adoption of sfas no 142 

  

the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances related to our capital losses tax planning strategy as discussed above and foreign items the effective tax rate in 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate due to valuation allowances related to capital losses and other nondeductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization and to a lesser extent note conversion expense 

  

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized” at december 31 2002 we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with our tax refund claims we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the twentyyear tax carryforward period 

  

we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax planning strategy which carries back certain federal net operating losses the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward 

  

period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2002 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 8000 million in taxable income from january 1 2003 to december 31 2022 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity 

  

loss from discontinued operations net 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary verestar by sale by december 31 2003 in the fourth quarter of 2002 we also committed to a plan to sell flash technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property in july 2002 we consummated the sale of our mts components operations in the first quarter of 2003 we committed to a plan to sell an office building in westwood massachusetts held primarily as rental property in the second quarter of 2003 we committed to a plan to sell kline by june 30 2004 in august 2003 we consummated the sale of galaxy accordingly we presented the results of these operations approximately 2452 million and 590 million net of tax in loss from discontinued operations net in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively loss from discontinued operations net for the year ended december 31 2002 also includes a net loss on our disposition of mts components and two office buildings of approximately 135 million net of a tax benefit 

  

cumulative effective of change in accounting principle net 

  

as of january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as a result we recognized a 5626 million noncash charge net of a tax benefit of 144 million as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the writedown of goodwill to its fair value the noncash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services segment 1893 million and network development services segment 3878 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the charge is reflected as of january 1 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

in 2003 we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations we believe cash flow from operations for the year ending december 31 2004 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for 2004 for information about our outstanding indebtedness see “—contractual obligations” below 

  

we expect our 2004 cash needs to consist primarily of the following debt service including cash interest of approximately 1950 million the repayment of approximately 758 million of term loans under our credit facilities and capital lease payments and other notes payable of 55 million capital expenditures of between 500 and 650 million principally related to new tower construction and improvements to existing towers and tower acquisitions of approximately 314 million we expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand cash generated by operations and proceeds from sales of noncore assets due to the risk factors outlined in “business—factors that may affect future results” however there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our cash needs without additional borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately 34 billion we incurred substantially all of this indebtedness prior to 2002 in order to fund the acquisition of communications sites and services businesses expenditures for such acquisitions for the years ended december 31 2000 and 2001 were 14 billion and 8128 million respectively and capital expenditures related to the construction of new communications sites capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2000 and 2001 were 5413 million and 5682 million respectively 

  

beginning in 2002 we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness in 2003 we continued this trend by reducing our net total indebtedness the combined decrease in outstanding indebtedness and the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments by approximately 2355 million we also improved our financial flexibility by opportunistically refinancing approximately 10 billion of our indebtedness to extend maturity dates we plan to continue to reduce our overall indebtedness in 2004 and beyond with cash flow from operations and may opportunistically further reduce indebtedness and interest expense through future capital market or strategic transactions 

  

uses of cash 

  

tower construction improvement and acquisition historically we have used available cash and proceeds from noncore asset sales including cash obtained from our credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of our debt and equity securities to fund the construction improvement and acquisition of tower assets in 2002 we began to reduce our capital expenditures on new tower development as a result we significantly reduced our capital expenditures on new tower development in 2003 from historical levels for example our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 616 million in 2003 as compared to 1805 million and 5682 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively and we expect this trend to continue accordingly we expect that our cash needs in 2004 for tower development improvement and acquisition will be funded out of cash from operations and proceeds from asset dispositions 

  

   

   

we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions accordingly we may continue to acquire tower sites build new tower sites and redevelop or improve existing tower sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria 

  

debt service as of december 31 2003 we had outstanding debt of approximately 34 billion for the year ending december 31 2004 we are obligated to make a total of approximately 2760 million in cash interest and principal payments on outstanding debt this amount excludes approximately 820 million of noncash interest expense relating to the accretion of our ati 1225 notes and warrants and the amortization of deferred financing costs our cash debt service obligations as of december 31 2003 are summarized under “—contractual obligations” below 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of december 31 2003 in thousands 

  

   

a description of our contractual debt obligations is included in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” as well as in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

    

      

the above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of december 31 2003 as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

sources of cash 

  

total liquidity at december 31 2003 as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 5448 million of total liquidity which is comprised of approximately 2755 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to draw approximately 2693 million of the revolving loan under our credit facilities of the approximately 2755 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 1700 million is held in restrictive accounts and approximately 491 million of this amount must be used to repay existing indebtedness 

  

cash generated by operations for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 our cash provided by operating activities was 1564 million 1051 million and 261 million respectively each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2004 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures for tower construction improvements and acquisitions we expect to use the excess cash generated from these segments principally to service our debt 

  

credit facilities as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 2693 million of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility the only loan under our credit facilities that is not fully drawn we have not borrowed any amounts under our credit facilities since april 2002 and we do not anticipate borrowing any amounts under the revolving credit facility during 2004 in february 2004 we made a 210 million voluntary prepayment of term loan a under our credit facilities 

  

proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities during 2003 we raised approximately 11 billion in net proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities as follows 

  

   

the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay approximately 9613 million of existing indebtedness and approximately 1700 million remains in restricted cash and investments at december 31 2003 in addition during 2003 we issued 8415984 shares of our class a common stock in exchange for an aggregate amount of approximately 531 million accreted value 672 million face value of our 225 convertible notes these exchanges were effected in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to section 3a9 under the securities act of 1933 

  

in february 2004 we raised an additional approximately 2217 million of net proceeds through an institutional private placement of our 750 senior notes due 2012 approximately 2171 million of the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all of our outstanding 625 convertible notes due 2009 and 45 million of those proceeds were used to repurchase our 50 convertible notes see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

divestiture proceeds during 2003 we continued to execute our strategy of divesting noncore assets and reinvesting the proceeds of such divestitures in higher return tower assets from january 1 2003 to march 5 2004 we received net proceeds of approximately 1239 million from noncore asset sales related to the sale of our remaining components business two office buildings a verestar subsidiary galaxy kline and noncore towers and related assets proceeds from these and any future transactions have and will be used to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages to acquire additional tower assets and to service debt we anticipate receiving approximately 100 million of proceeds from additional sales of noncore assets during 2004 

  

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

internally generated funds the key factors affecting our ability to generate sufficient funds from operations are the demand for antennae space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies 

  

restrictions under credit facilities and other debt securities the credit facilities with our borrower subsidiaries contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions including limitations on additional debt guarantees use of proceeds from asset sales dividends and other distributions investments and liens with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply 

  

the credit facilities contain five financial tests with which we must comply 

  

   

   

   

   

   

any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving line of credit but would also constitute a default these covenants also restrict our ability as the parent company to incur any debt other than that currently outstanding and refinancings of that debt the credit facilities also limit our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand 

  

in addition to the credit facilities the indentures governing the terms of the ati 1225 notes and the ati 725 notes contain certain restrictive covenants with which ati the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply these include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions make certain investments and as in the credit facilities use the proceeds from asset sales any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically the indentures restrict ati each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock ati the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted however to incur debt under our credit facilities or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings of them up to 16 billion 

  

the indentures governing the terms of our 9 3  8  senior notes and our 750 senior notes issued in february 2004 also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions make certain investments and as in the credit facilities use the proceeds from asset sales any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default specifically the senior note indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow we are permitted however to incur debt under our credit facilities which for these purposes includes indebtedness under the credit facilities of our borrower subsidiaries the ati 1225 notes the ati 725 notes and a portion of our 325 convertible notes even if we are not in compliance with this ratio or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities 

  

if a default occurred under our credit facilities or any of our other debt securities the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the various agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants however due to the risk factors outlined above in “business—factors that may affect future results” there can be no assurance that our financial performance will not deteriorate to a point that would result in a default 

  

as outlined above as of december 31 2003 our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately 2760 million 3030 million 5400 million which does not reflect the repurchase of our 625 convertible notes in february 2004 

  

8670 million 9410 million and 19 billion respectively if we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future in addition as a holding company we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries or funds raised through debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and senior subordinated notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances accordingly if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 

  

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance such debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance which is subject to many factors beyond our control as outlined above under “business – factors that may affect future results” in addition our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies which are dependent on our expected financial performance the liquidity factors discussed above and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry we expect that we will need to refinance a substantial portion or our debt on or prior to its scheduled maturity in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or if such refinancings are obtained that the terms will be commercially reasonable 

  

capital markets our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on among other things general economic conditions conditions of the wireless industry our financial performance and the state of the capital markets in december 2003 we filed a “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to 10 billion of debt andor equity securities including the offering of class a common stock pursuant to a direct stock purchase plan with respect to which our board of directors currently has approved a 1500 million offering this registration statement is not yet effective 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to income taxes impairment of assets allowances for accounts receivable investment impairment charges and revenue recognition management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for management’s judgment in its application there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result for a discussion of our other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k beginning on page f7 

  

   

   

we intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims related to certain federal net operating losses filed during 2003 as part of a tax planning strategy implemented in 2002 the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 10 billion in taxable income from january 1 2004 to december 31 2023 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity 

  

depending on the resolution of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in verestar no income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings 

  

   

assets subject to amortization and noncore assets held for sale  we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 

  

goodwill—assets not subject to amortization  as of january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but reviewed for impairment at least annually sfas no 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test these tests compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment if any we completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to verestar was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in the services segment was impaired as a result we recognized a 5626 million noncash charge net of a tax benefit of 144 million related to the writedown of goodwill to its fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the charge is reflected as of january 1 2002 and included in the results of operations 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for the rental and management segment and verestar and future discounted cash flows and market information in the services segment 

  

in december 2003 and 2002 we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of the rental and management reporting unit incorporating an independent third party appraisal that contains goodwill and in both cases determined that goodwill was not impaired fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information changes to which could affect those fair value estimates our december 2002 annual impairment testing also included the remaining goodwill of kline the only services business with remaining goodwill and based on available market information we determined that goodwill was not impaired in june 2003 we committed to a plan to sell kline reclassified its net assets to assets held for sale and recorded an impairment charge inclusive of kline’s remaining 103 million of goodwill that reduced kline’s net assets to the estimated fair value expected upon disposal 

  

we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test on december 1 st of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired

 item 1 business 

  

   

we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company with a portfolio of approximately 15000 towers including pending transactions our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications towers to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies we operate the largest portfolio of wireless communications towers in north america and are the largest independent operator of broadcast towers in north america based on number of towers our tower portfolio provides us with a recurring base of leasing revenues from our existing customers and growth potential due to the capacity to add more tenants and equipment to these towers our broad network of towers enables us to address the needs of wireless service providers on a national basis we also offer select tower related services such as antennae and line installation and site acquisition and zoning services which are strategic to our core leasing business 

  

we intend to capitalize on the increasing use of wireless communication services by actively marketing space available for leasing on our existing towers and selectively developing or acquiring new towers that meet our return on investment criteria 

  

our core leasing business which we refer to as our rental and management segment accounted for approximately 939 and 866 of our segment operating profit for the years ended december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 respectively in 2003 we expect that our rental and management segment will contribute at least 95 of our segment operating profit which we define as segment revenue less direct segment expense rental and management segment operating profit includes interest income tv azteca net – see notes 6 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements 

  

an element of our strategy is to continue to focus our operations on our rental and management segment by divesting noncore assets using the proceeds to purchase high quality tower assets and reducing outstanding indebtedness between january 1 2002 and march 4 2003 we completed approximately 2035 million of noncore asset sales comprised of certain assets in our network development services and satellite and fiber network access services segments more than 700 noncore towers and two office buildings in our rental and management segment 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary verestar which comprised our entire satellite and fiber network access services segment accordinglyverestar is now accounted for as a discontinued operation we plan to dispose of these assets within twelve months and have nominal if any commitment to invest additional funds in verestar during the pendency of such divestiture with the exception of financial guarantees of up to 120 million for certain contractual obligations in addition we are seeking to sell approximately 500 million of additional noncore assets during the remainder of 2003 we expect that a portion of the proceeds from our consummated and future noncore asset sales will be reinvested in higher quality tower assets 

  

we believe that this strategy of focusing our operations on our rental and management segment will make our consolidated operating cash flows more stable and provide us with continuing growth because of the following characteristics of our core leasing business 

  

   

  

   

   

   

for more financial information about our business segments and geographic information about our operating revenues segment operating profit and longlived assets see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and “management’s discussion of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

strategy 

  

our strategy is to capitalize on the increasing use of wireless communication services and the infrastructure requirements necessary to deploy current and future generations of wireless communication technologies between december 1995 and december 2002 the number of wireless phone subscribers in the united states increased from 338 million to 1408 million in addition the minutes of use of wireless phone services among wireless carriers in the united states increased from 378 billion for the full year 1995 to nearly 6190 billion for the full year 2002 from december 1995 through december 2002 the number of cell sites also increased from 22700 to 139300  we expect that the continued growth of wireless subscribers and minutes of use of wireless personal communications and phone services will require wireless carriers to add a significant number of additional cell sites to maintain the performance of their networks in the areas they currently cover and to extend service to areas where coverage does not yet exist in addition we believe that as data wireless services such as email and internet access are deployed on a widespread basis the deployment of these technologies will require wireless carriers to further increase the cell density of their existing networks may require an overlay of new technology equipment and may increase the demand for geographic expansion of their network coverage to meet this demand we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their tower infrastructure needs as a means of improving existing service coverage implementing new technology accelerating access to their markets and preserving capital rather than constructing and operating their own towers and maintaining their own tower service and development capabilities 

  

we believe that our existing portfolio of towers our tower related services and network development capabilities and our management team position us to benefit from these communication trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters the key elements of our strategy include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

operational initiatives 

  

in late 2001 we announced an initiative to accelerate the process of shifting our focus from acquisitions and development activities to operational execution 

  

streamlined administrative functions  during 2002 we simplified and streamlined our united states rental and management and services organizations moving from five regions and twenty areas to three regions and ten areas by year end we also centralized our lease processing and accounting operations into single locations and integrated our construction unit and tower operations unit into a single unit these initiatives yielded a significant increase in productivity per employee improved margin performance and resulted in faster and more consistent customer service 

  

  

reduced capital spending  we believe that our existing tower portfolio has the scope and available capacity to address a significant portion of our customers’ tower needs we also believe that the highest investment returns can be achieved by adding tenants to our existing portfolio as a result we significantly reduced our capital expenditures on new tower development in 2002 and will continue to do so in 2003 we plan to build between 100 and 150 towers in 2003 in contrast to 311 towers including ten broadcast towers in 2002 and 1319 towers including five broadcast towers in 2001 in addition we expect our 2003 capital expenditures to continue to decrease to approximately 500 to 750 million compared to total capital expenditures of approximately 1805 million in 2002 and 5682 million in 2001 we will continue to use more selective criteria for new tower development and will not undertake any development project unless it is likely to meet our heightened nearterm return on investment criteria 

  

products and services 

  

our primary business is our leasing business which we refer to as our rental and management segment we also offer tower related services that are strategic to our rental and management segment through our network development services segment in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of our satellite and fiber network access services segment operations within the next twelve months and now account for the segment as a discontinued operation see “business—satellite and fiber network access services discontinued operations” 

  

rental and management 

  

leasing of antennae sites  our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications towers to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies giving effect to pending transactions we operate a tower network of approximately 15000 multiuser sites in the united states mexico and brazil including more than 300 broadcast tower sites approximately 14000 of these towers are owned or leased sites and approximately 1000 are managed sites or leasesublease sites under which we hold a position as lessee that terminates at the same time as a related sublease our networks in the united states and mexico are national in scope our us network spans 49 states and the district of columbia in addition 84 of our us network provides coverage in the top 100 markets or core areas such as high traffic interstate corridors giving effect to pending transactions our mexican network includes more than 1600 sites in highly populated areas including mexico city monterrey guadalajara and acapulco our brazilian network consists of approximately 275 towers 

  

we lease antenna space on our towers to tenants in a diverse range of wireless communications and broadcast industries wireless industries we serve include personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized mobile radio specialized mobile radio paging fixed microwave and fixed wireless our major customers include alltel att wireless services cingular wireless nextel sprint pcs tmobile formerly called voicestream and verizon and their respective affiliates 

  

the number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the tower’s location height and the structural capacity at certain wind speeds an antenna’s height on a tower and the tower’s location determine the lineofsight of the antenna with the horizon and consequently the distance a signal can be transmitted some of our customers such as personal communications services enhanced specialized mobile radio providers and cellular companies in metropolitan areas usually do not need to place their equipment at the highest tower point other customers including paging companies and specialized mobile radio providers in rural areas need higher elevations for broader coverage we believe that many wellengineered and welllocated towers built to serve the specifications of an initial anchor tenant in the wireless communications sector will accommodate three or more wireless tenants over time thereby increasing revenue and enhancing margins 

  

lease terms  our leases like most of those in the tower industry generally vary depending upon the region and the industry user television and radio broadcasters prefer long term leases while wireless communications providers favor leases in the range of five to ten years in duration in both cases the leases often have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant both wireless carriers and broadcasters tend to renew 

  

their leases with us repositioning an antenna in a wireless carrier’s network is expensive and often requires reconfiguring several other antennae in the carrier’s network and may require the carrier to obtain other governmental permits 

  

most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease these automatic increases are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage inflation or a fixed percentage plus inflation 

  

annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

tower development historically cellular and other wireless service providers had constructed and owned a majority of the towers for their own antennae needs rather than leasing space on towers from a third party beginning in the late 1990s wireless service providers expressed a growing interest in having independent companies own and operate the towers for their antennae due to the relatively high capital costs and operating expenses for a single carrier’s use this trend resulted in our entering into agreements with a number of wireless carriers to construct and subsequently lease space on towers in key areas identified as optimal for their network expansion requirements in most cases because we own the constructed towers we are able to lease space on them to other tenants as well as to the original tenant 

  

network development services 

  

we provide towerrelated services that are strategic to our rental and management segment 

  

antennae and line installation and construction services we are one of the leading builders of wireless communication and broadcast towers as part of our network development services we provide antennae and line installation and maintenance services for wireless communication towers and broadcast towers these services use not only our constructionrelated skills but also our technical expertise to ensure that new installations do not cause interference with other tenants we believe that our antennae and line installation services and maintenance capabilities provide us with a significant opportunity to capture incremental revenue on existing and newly built sites 

  

in recent years we have built a significant number of towers predominantly for our own account the cost of construction of a tower varies by site location and terrain tower type and height and any governmental and environmental requirements nonbroadcast towers whether on a rooftop or the ground generally cost between 200000 and 300000 to construct broadcast towers are generally much taller are built to bear a greater load vary in height much more than nonbroadcast towers and cost significantly more than nonbroadcast towers 

  

site acquisition and zoning services  we engage in site acquisition services for our own account in connection with tower development projects and other proprietary construction as well as for third parties with respect to new towers the site selection and acquisition process begins with the network design we identify highway corridors population centers and topographical features within the carrier’s existing or proposed network and then select the most suitable sites based on demographics traffic patterns and the carrier’s frequency characteristics and technology we also provide services related to zoning structural engineering and construction 

  

  

other services and infrastructure  as part of our full service offering we also provide radio frequency engineering network design and towerrelated consulting services through our galaxy engineering unit in addition we own and operate kline iron  steel an established steel fabricator that builds broadcast towers and provides steel for other construction projects 

  

satellite and fiber network access services discontinued operations 

  

our verestar subsidiary is a provider of integrated satellite and fiber network access services for telecommunications companies internet service providers isps broadcasters maritime customers and governmental organizations both domestic and international we own and operate more than 175 satellite antennae at six satellite network access points in the united states and abroad these operations enable us to access the majority of commercial satellites around the world 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to sell verestar which comprised our satellite and fiber network access services segment by december 31 2003 through the divestiture process we will have nominal if any commitment to invest additional funds in verestar with the exception of approximately 120 million of verestar’s contractual obligations that we have guaranteed depending on the terms of the final disposition we may remain liable for these guarantees we now account for verestar as a discontinued operation and accordingly we no longer have a satellite and fiber network access services segment 

  

recent transactions 

  

acquisitions 

  

nii holdings inc  in december 2002 we agreed to acquire approximately 540 communications sites from nii holdings predominantly in mexico for an aggregate purchase price of 1000 million in cash as part of the transaction we also agreed to provide up to 250 additional communication sites for nii holdings’ incremental network buildout we acquired 140 communication sites for approximately 262 million in december 2002 and an additional 147 communication sites for approximately 240 million as of march 4 2003 the remaining communication sites are expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2003 we continue to expect to fund the closings with proceeds from noncore asset sales 

  

dispositions 

  

from january 1 2002 through march 4 2003 we completed approximately 2035 million of noncore asset sales significant dispositions included the following 

  

noncore towers  we disposed of over 700 noncore tower assets for approximately 250 million during 2002 these dispositions are part of our program to actively manage our portfolio of tower assets by selling noncore towers and reinvesting a portion of the total proceeds in high quality tower assets such as the towers we are acquiring from nii holdings 

  

mts components in july 2002 we sold mts components part of our components business for approximately 320 million which consisted of approximately 200 million in cash paid at closing and 120 million of notes receivable 

  

office buildings  in december 2002 we sold the building where we maintain our corporate headquarters at 116 huntington avenue boston massachusetts proceeds from the sale were approximately 680 million of which approximately 385 million was used to retire the existing mortgage indebtedness in march 2003 we sold an additional office building for approximately 106 million these buildings were primarily held as rental property in our rental and management segment 

  

flash technologies in january 2003 we sold flash technologies our lighting systems business for net cash proceeds of approximately 411 million subject to a postclosing working capital adjustment 

  

  

mtn  in february 2003 we sold maritime telecommunications network mtn a subsidiary of verestar for approximately 268 million in cash the net proceeds from the sale were used to repay loans as required under our credit facilities 

  

management organization 

  

our corporate headquarters is in boston massachusetts in 2002 we streamlined our rental and management organization from five to three regions and from twenty to ten areas in the united states each region is headed by a vice president who reports to our executive vice president of tower operations who in turn reports to our president and chief operating officer our current regional centers in the united states are based in boston massachusetts chicago illinois and phoenix arizona and are further subdivided into ten area operations centers that are staffed with skilled engineering construction management and marketing personnel our centralized lease processing for the rental and management segment is based in woburn massachusetts and our related accounting operations are based in atlanta georgia our international regional centers are based in mexico city mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe our united states and international regional and area operations centers are capable of responding effectively to the opportunities and customer needs of their defined geographic areas 

  

regulatory matters 

  

towers and licenses both the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasting these regulations govern the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new antenna structures or modifications to existing antenna structures must be reviewed by the faa prior to initiation to ensure that the structure will not present a hazard to aircraft navigation after the faa issues a “no hazard” determination the tower owner must register the antenna structure with the fcc and paint and light the structure in accordance with the faa determination the faa review and the fcc registration processes are prerequisites to fcc authorization of communications devices placed on the antenna structure tower owners bear the responsibility for notifying the faa of any tower lighting failures and for the repair of those lighting failures tower owners also must notify the fcc when ownership of a tower changes we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable standards failure to comply with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties 

  

the fcc separately regulates and licenses wireless communications devices and radio and television stations transmitting from the towers based upon the particular frequency used we hold through various subsidiaries certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the fcc including satellite earth stations private microwave and specialized mobile radio stations which are subject to regulation by the fcc we are required to obtain the fcc’s approval prior to assigning these licenses or transferring control of any entity of ours which holds fcc licenses 

  

the fcc considers the construction of a new tower or collocation of an antenna on an existing antenna structure including building rooftops and watertanks to be a federal undertaking subject to prior environmental review and approval under the national environmental policy act of 1969 “nepa” which obligates federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of undertakings to determine whether they may significantly affect the environment the fcc has issued regulations implementing nepa as well as the national historic preservation act the endangered species act and the american indian religious freedom act these regulations place responsibility on each applicant or licensee to investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower or collocating an antenna if a tower or collocation may have a significant impact on the environment fcc approval of the tower or collocation could be significantly delayed in january 2002 the fcc’s wireless bureau dismissed for lack of standing challenges to the registration of seven of our towers filed by certain environmental groups the challenges alleged that we had failed to comply with nepa and that the fcc’s rules 

  

implementing nepa are inadequate the petitioners have appealed the bureau’s decision to the fcc if the bureau’s decision is overturned we could be subject to monetary penalties or increased compliance obligations in august 2002 the same environmental groups asked the fcc to review the tower registrations of more than 5000 towers in the gulf coast region to assess compliance with the endangered species act and migratory bird treaty act and to require the filing of new or revised environmental assessments under nepa for all towers in the region we own a number of the towers identified in the pleading however because the pleading was not served on us we have not been asked by the fcc to respond pcia a trade association representing the tower industry has asked the fcc to dismiss the pleading based on numerous grounds the matter is pending in february 2003 the same environmental groups filed suit against the fcc in a federal appeals court asking the court to force the fcc to address the groups’ pending requests and appeals and asked the court to force the fcc to adopt more stringent environmental rules depending on how the court rules we could be subject to increased compliance obligations in addition a ruling in the federal appeals court could affect the groups’ pending cases with the fcc 

  

in january 2001 the fcc concluded investigations of several operators of communications towers including us the fcc sent us a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture nal preliminarily determining that we had failed to file certain informational forms had failed to properly post certain information at various tower sites and on one occasion had failed to properly light a tower the fcc also ordered an additional review of our overall procedures for and degree of compliance with the fcc’s regulations we reached a settlement with the fcc regarding the compliance issues arising out of the nal in the form of a consent decree as part of the consent decree the fcc has rescinded the nal and terminated the further investigation ordered in the nal in september 2001 we made a voluntary contribution of 03 million to the us treasury and agreed to maintain an active compliance plan failure to comply with the consent decree may lead to additional monetary penalties and loss of the right to hold our various registrations and licenses 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by limiting state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of wireless communications towers the law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations the telecommunications act of 1996 also requires the federal government to help licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

  

we are also subject to local and county zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or collocations on existing towers local zoning authorities often are in opposition to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction collocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition those regulations increase costs associated with new tower construction and collocation existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction and collocations and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could adversely affect our construction program and operations 

  

our tower operations in mexico and brazil are also subject to regulation if we pursue additional international opportunities we will be subject to regulations in additional foreign jurisdictions in addition our customers both domestic and foreign also may be subject to new regulatory policies that may adversely affect the demand for communications sites 

  

  

satellite and fiber network access discontinued operations we are required to obtain licenses and other authorizations from the fcc for our use of radio frequencies to provide satellite and wireless services in the united states we are also required to obtain authorizations from foreign regulatory agencies in connection with our provision of these services abroad we hold a number of pointtopoint microwave radio licenses that are used to provide telecommunications services additionally we hold a number of satellite earth station licenses in connection with our operation of satellitebased networks we are required to obtain consent from the fcc prior to assigning these licenses or transferring control of any of our companies holding an fcc license 

  

environmental matters our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under those laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination 

  

we and our customers also may be required to obtain permits obey regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances used at our sites by our customers violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines andor criminal sanctions in october 2001 we paid 150000 in civil penalties related to certain alleged environmental permitting and filing violations in the county of santa clara in california 

  

health safety and transportation   as an fcc licensee we are subject to regulations and guidelines imposing certain operational obligations relating to radio frequency emissions as employers we are subject to osha and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from radio frequency exposure our construction teams are subject to regulation by osha and equivalent state agencies concerning health and safety matters our heavy vehicles and their drivers are subject to regulation by the department of transportation 

  

competition and new technologies 

  

rental and management segment competition we compete for antennae site customers with other national independent tower companies wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks and lease tower space to other carriers rooftop and other alternative site structures site development companies that acquire space on existing towers for wireless service providers and manage new tower construction and independent tower operators we believe that tower location and capacity price and quality of service historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites 

  

network development services segment competition our network development services compete with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and carriers’ internal staffs we believe that carriers base their decisions on network development services on various criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project kline iron  steel competes with numerous other steel fabricators many of which have substantially greater resources 

  

we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors relating to our rental and management and network development services segments 

  

  

new technologies the emergence or growth of new technologies could reduce the need for towerbased transmission and reception and may therefore have a negative impact on our operations these technologies include signal combining technologies which permit one antenna to service two different frequencies of transmission and thereby two customers may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission and hence demand for tower space technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennas” which can increase the capacity at existing sites and can reduce the number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base delivery of wireless telephony services by direct broadcast satellites or cable providers which could reduce the demand for tower space indoor distribution systems which relieve some capacity on existing networks and could have an adverse effect on our operations and capacity enhancing technologies such as lowerrate vocoders and more spectrally efficient airlink standards which potentially relieve network capacity problems without adding sites and could adversely affect our operations 

  

any increase in the use of network sharing or roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect the demand for tower space these arrangements which are essentially extensions of traditional roaming agreements enable a provider to serve customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace wireless service providers might consider such sharing or resale arrangements superior to constructing their own facilities or leasing our antenna space one possible benefit of such arrangements however is that network sharing arrangements could stimulate network development in areas where a single carrier network is economically unattractive 

  

construction manufacturing and raw materials 

  

we build maintain and install land based wireless communications and broadcast transmitting and receiving facilities by obtaining sheet metal and other raw material parts and components from a variety of vendors we also engage third party contract manufacturers to construct certain of these facilities we have historically obtained the majority of our sheet metal and other raw materials parts and components from a limited number of suppliers however substantially all of these items are available from numerous other suppliers we have not to date experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining the needed quantities of materials from suppliers in a timely manner 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2002 we employed approximately 1900 full time individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

factors that may affect future results 

  

decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand 

  

many of the factors affecting the demand for wireless communications tower space and to a lesser extent our services business could materially affect our operating results those factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the demand for broadcast antenna space is dependent to a significantly lesser extent on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission we could also be affected adversely should the development of digital television be delayed or impaired or if demand for it were less than anticipated because of delays disappointing technical performance or cost to the consumer 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 

  

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness our total indebtedness at year end giving effect to our approximately 4200 million offering of senior subordinated discount notes in january 2003 and the subsequent 2000 million prepayment of term loans outstanding under our credit facilities was approximately 36 billion excluding any assumed repayment of other indebtedness out of the remaining proceeds from the discount notes offering 

  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences including 

  

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our participation or inability to participate in tower industry consolidation could involve certain risks 

  

any merger or acquisition transaction would involve several risks to our business including demands on managerial personnel that could divert their attention from other aspects of our core leasing business increased operating risks due to the integration of major national networks into our operational system and potential antitrust constraints either in local markets or on a regional basis that could require selective divestitures at unfavorable prices any completed transaction may have an adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following its completion while we integrate the operations of the other business in addition once integrated combined operations may not necessarily achieve the levels of revenues profitability or productivity anticipated there also may be limitations on our ability to consummate a merger or acquisition transaction for example any transaction would have to comply with the terms of our loan agreement and note indentures and there are regulatory constraints on business combinations our inability to consummate a merger or acquisition for these or other reasons could result in our failure to participate in the expected benefits of industry consolidation and may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete effectively 

  

continuation of the current us economic slowdown could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

the existing slowdown in the us economy has negatively affected the factors described under the prior heading influencing demand for tower space and tower related services for example the slowdown coupled with the deterioration of the capital markets has caused certain wireless service providers to delay and in certain cases abandon expansion and upgrading of wireless networks implementation of new systems or introduction of new technologies as a result demand has also decreased for many of our network development services the economic slowdown has also harmed and may continue to harm the financial condition of some wireless service providers many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage and some wireless service providers including customers of ours have filed for bankruptcy 

  

if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap as do their expansion plans similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antennae space in january 2003 the spectrum cap which previously prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area was allowed to expire some wireless carriers may be encouraged to consolidate with each other as a result of this regulatory change and as a means to strengthen their financial condition consolidation among wireless carriers would also increase our risk that the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially decrease revenues and cash flows 

  

  

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants 

  

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants during the past two years several of our customers have filed for bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage if one or more of our major lease customers experienced financial difficulties it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and our loss of significant customers and anticipated lease revenues 

  

restrictive covenants in our credit facilities senior notes and senior subordinated discount notes could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility 

  

the indentures for our senior notes our senior subordinated discount notes issued in january 2003 and our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants and in the case of the credit facilities requirements of complying with certain leverage and other financial tests these limit our ability to take various actions including the incurrence of additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness and issuing preferred stock engaging in various types of transactions including mergers and sales of assets and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments including investments these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisition or other opportunities 

  

our foreign operations could create expropriation governmental regulation funds inaccessibility foreign exchange exposure and management problems 

  

our expansion in mexico and brazil and any other possible foreign operations in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the united states we have loaned 1198 million to a mexican company own or have the economic rights to over 1700 towers in mexico including approximately 200 broadcast towers giving effect to pending transactions and subject to certain rejection rights are contractually committed to construct up to approximately 650 additional towers in that country over the next three years giving effect to pending transactions we also own or have acquired the rights to approximately 275 communications towers in brazil and are subject to certain rejection rights contractually committed to construct up to 350 additional towers in that country over the next three years the actual number of sites constructed will vary depending on the build out plans of the applicable carrier in december 2002 we agreed to acquire approximately 540 communications sites from nii holdings predominantly in mexico for an aggregate purchase price of 1000 million in cash we may should economic and capital market conditions improve also engage in comparable transactions in other countries in the future among the risks of foreign operations are governmental expropriation and regulation inability to repatriate earnings or other funds currency fluctuations difficulty in recruiting trained personnel and language and cultural differences all of which could adversely affect our operations 

  

new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues 

  

the development and implementation of signal combining technologies which permit one antenna to service two different transmission frequencies and thereby two customers may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission and hence demand for our antenna space technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennas” can increase the capacity at existing sites and can reduce the number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base 

  

in addition the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for towerbased transmission and reception and have an adverse effect on our operations the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites could also adversely affect demand for our antenna space 

  

  

indoor distribution systems relieve some capacity on existing networks and could have an adverse effect on our operations capacity enhancing technologies such as lowerrate vocoders and more spectrally efficient airlink standards potentially relieve network capacity problems without adding sites and could adversely effect our operations 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws 

  

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state and local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as owner lessee or operator of approximately 15000 real estate sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with those laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do 

  

we are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation of our business including regulation by the faa fcc environmental protection agency department of transportation and osha both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television antennae and the fcc separately regulates transmitting devices operating on towers similar regulations exist in mexico brazil and other foreign countries regarding wireless communications and the operation of communications towers local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction collocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction and locations and additional regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs to us or which prevent or restrict new tower construction in certain locations these factors could adversely affect our operations 

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may adversely affect us 

  

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors are in weak financial condition competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and service income in addition if we lose customers due to pricing we may not be able to find new customers leading to an accompanying adverse effect on our profitability increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly 

  

our competition includes 

  

   

   

   

   

  

we may not be able to maintain the leases for our tower sites 

  

our property interests in our tower sites consist primarily of fee and leasehold interests private easements and easements licenses or rightsofway granted by governmental entities a loss of these interests including losses arising from the bankruptcy of one or more of our lessors or from the default by one or more of our lessors under their mortgage financing could interfere with our ability to conduct our business we also may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms in addition we may not always have the ability to access examine and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing a purchase or lease of tower sites 

  

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated 

  

public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to future siting efforts the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive 

  

if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects including cancer were established or if the public perception that such a connection exists were to increase our operations costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters 

  

the market for our class a common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our class a common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations these fluctuations could be caused by 

  

   

   

   

   

in addition in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies these market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 

  

if we issue a significant number of shares of class a common stock to satisfy certain obligations under our convertible notes the trading price for our class a common stock could be adversely affected 

  

holders of our three series of convertible notes totaling 8736 million outstanding at december 31 2002 may require us to repurchase all or any of their convertible notes on dates and for the prices indicated in the discussion contained under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — certain contractual commitments” our credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase convertible notes for cash except that we now have the right to use up to 2170 million to prepay or repurchase the 225 convertible notes and to the extent we do not and are not required to do so to prepay or repurchase prior to june 30 2004 any of our other convertible notes or our senior notes we may subject to certain conditions in the applicable indentures including the condition that our class a common stock trade on a national securities exchange or nasdaq elect to pay the repurchase price in shares of class a common stock exercising this election or seeking to reduce the amount of outstanding convertible notes 

  

prior to these dates may involve the issuance of a significant number of shares of our class a common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for these shares which could cause the trading price of our class a common stock to decline 

  

there will be dilution of the value of our class a common stock when outstanding warrants become exercisable 

  

in january 2003 we issued warrants to purchase approximately 114 million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our 1225 senior subordinated discount notes offering the shares underlying the warrants represented approximately 55 of our outstanding common stock at issuance assuming all the warrants are exercised these warrants will become exercisable on or after january 29 2006 at an exercise price of 001 per share see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements the issuance of these shares will have a dilutive effect on the value of our class a common stock when these warrants are exercised 

  

if we are unable to sell our verestar subsidiary we may incur additional costs if we have to wind down and liquidate this business 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to sell verestar which previously comprised our satellite and fiber network access services segment within the next twelve months with the exception of guarantees of approximately 120 million of verestar’s contractual obligations we will have nominal if any obligations to fund verestar’s business through the divestiture process if we are unable to sell verestar prior to december 31 2003 however we may be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate its assets if this were to occur we could incur additional costs in connection with the winding down and liquidation of verestar’s businesses and our management could be distracted from the operations of our core leasing business during this process 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

we maintain our corporate headquarters at 116 huntington avenue boston massachusetts where we lease approximately 30000 square feet of office space prior to december 2002 we owned the building containing this office space our operating segments occupy headquarters or regional offices warehouses and manufacturing space which we move into and out of from time to time as our business needs change at present the properties used in these business segments are as follows 

  

   

   

   

our interests in individual communications sites are comprised of a variety of fee and leasehold interests of the approximately 15000 towers comprising our portfolio giving effect to pending transactions approximately 19 are located on parcels of land that we own and approximately 81 are either located on parcels of land that 

  

we have leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements and easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities or are sites that we manage for third parties in rural areas a wireless communications site typically consists of 10000 square feet tracts which supports towers equipment shelters and guy wires to stabilize the structure whereas a broadcast tower site typically consists of a tract of land up to twentyacres less than 2500 square feet are required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communication tower sites land leases generally have an initial term of five years with three or four additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of twenty to twentyfive years 

  

pursuant to our credit facilities the lenders have liens on among other things all towers leasehold interests tenant leases contracts relating to the management of towers for others cash accounts receivable the stock and other equity interests of virtually all of our subsidiaries and all intercompany debt fixtures inventory and other personal property including intellectual property certain fee interests and any proceeds of the foregoing 

  

we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business we believe after consultation with counsel that no matters currently pending would in the event of an adverse outcome have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

  

no matters were submitted to a vote of our security holders in the fourth quarter of 2002

the outstanding shares of common stock and number of registered holders as of december 31 2002 were as follows 

  

   

dividends 

  

we have never paid a dividend on any class of common stock we anticipate that we will retain future earnings if any to fund the development and growth of our business we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on shares of common stock in the foreseeable future our borrower subsidiaries are prohibited under the terms of their credit facilities from paying cash dividends or making other distributions on or making redemptions purchases or other acquisitions of their capital stock or other equity interests including preferred stock except that beginning on april 15 2004 if no default exists or would be created thereby under the credit facilities our borrower subsidiaries may pay cash dividends or make other distributions to the extent that restricted payments as defined in the credit facilities do not exceed 50 of excess cash flow as defined in the credit facilities for the preceding calendar year the 1225 senior subordinated discount notes issued in january 2003 of american towers inc ati our principal operating subsidiary impose similar limitations on the ability of ati and certain of our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the discount notes sister guarantors to pay dividends and make other distributions the indenture for our 9 3  8  senior notes due 2009 imposes significant limitations on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders 

  

  




 item 7 management’s   discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading “critical accounting policies” on page 40 

  

during the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 we acquired various communications sites service businesses and satellite and fiber network access related businesses for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 557 million 8272 million and 18 billion respectively our results of operations only reflect the acquired towers and businesses in the periods following their respective dates of acquisition as such our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 2001 and the results for the year ended december 31 2001 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 2000 

  

our continuing operations are reported in two segments rental and management and network development services management focuses on segment profit loss as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments we define segment operating profit loss as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization corporate general and administrative expense restructuring expense development expense and impairments and net loss on sale of longlived assets segment profit loss for the rental and management segment also includes interest income tv azteca net see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of verestar which previously comprised our entire satellite and fiber network access services segment by sale within the next twelve months in the fourth quarter of 2002 we also committed to a plan to sell flash technologies previously included in our network development services segment and two office buildings previously included in our rental and management segment in july 2002 we consummated the sale of mts components previously included in our network development services segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the consolidated statements of operations for periods reported in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” have been adjusted to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations 

  

results of operations 

  

years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

as of december 31 2002 we owned or operated approximately 14600 communications sites as compared to approximately 14500 communications sites as of december 31 2001 the acquisitions and construction completed throughout 2001 and to a lesser extent 2002 have significantly affected operations for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 

  

   

total revenues 

  

total revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 were 7884 million an increase of 33 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of 1136 million offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of 1103 million 

  

  

rental and management revenue 

  

rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 5489 million an increase of 1136 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to january 1 2001 and to a lesser extent increased revenue on towers that existed as of january 1 2001 the 4270 towers that we have acquired and constructed since january 1 2001 have significantly increased our revenues the increased depth and strength of our national and international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 the remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of january 1 2001 this increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers 

  

we continue to believe that our leasing revenue which drives our core business is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our expected increase in utilization of existing tower capacity in addition we believe that the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband type customers 

  

network development services revenue 

  

network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 2395 million a decrease of 1103 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the significant decline in revenues during 2002 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management installation tower maintenance services and radio frequency engineering services resulting from a corresponding decrease in the growth of the wireless telecommunications industry

impairments and net loss on sale of longlived assets for the year ended december 31 2002 was 907 million an increase of 165 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets of approximately 351 million related to the writedown and sale of certain noncore towers partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges of approximately 224 million related to the writeoff of constructionin progress costs associated with sites that we no longer plan to build

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 2556 million a decrease of 122 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the majority of the decrease 266 million resulted primarily from a reduction in the interest rates under our credit facilities the decrease was partially offset by an increase of 76 million related to a full year of interest incurred on our senior notes issued in january 2001 and a reduction in capitalized interest of 95 million as a result of our reduced capital expenditures in 2002 

  

loss on investments and other expense 

  

loss on investments and other expense for the year ended december 31 2002 was 256 million a decrease of 132 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease resulted primarily from decreased impairment and equity losses on our cost and equity investments offset by increased losses on foreign currency exchange related to our mexican subsidiary

income tax benefit 

  

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2002 was 646 million a decrease of 352 million from the year ended december 31 2001 the effective tax rate was 170 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 204 for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a valuation allowance of 275 million recorded in 2002 in connection with our plan to implement a tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing this strategy this decrease is offset by the impact of our ceasing to amortize goodwill the majority of which is nondeductible for tax purposes in 2002 in connection with the adoption of sfas no 142 

  

the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2002 differs from the statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our state net operating losses capital losses tax planning strategy and foreign items the effective tax rate in 2001 differs from the statutory rate due to valuation allowances related to state net operating losses and capital losses and other nondeductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization and to a lesser extent note conversion expense 

  

  

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized” at december 31 2002 we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing our tax planning strategy we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period 

  

we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset from our tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2002 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 8000 million in taxable income from january 1 2003 to december 31 2022 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or accelerate the utilization of losses as contemplated in our tax planning strategy we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity 

  

loss from discontinued operations net 

  

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary verestar by sale within the next twelve months in the fourth quarter of 2002 we also committed to a plan to sell flash technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property in july 2002 we consummated the sale of our mts components operations accordingly we presented the results of these operations 2499 million and 602 million net of tax as loss from discontinued operations net in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively the net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2002 also includes a net loss on disposal from the sale of mts components and the two office buildings of approximately 135 million net of a tax benefit

income tax benefit 

  

the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2001 was 999 million an increase of 340 million from the year ended december 31 2000 the primary reason for the increase is a result of the increase in our loss from continuing operations partially offset by an increase in amortization of nondeductible intangible items the effective tax rate on our loss from continuing operations was 204 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to 264 for the year ended december 31 2000 

  

the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2001 differs from the statutory rate due to certain nondeductible amounts for tax purposes such as the valuation allowances related to state net operating losses capital losses and the effects of other nondeductible items such as goodwill amortization and note conversion expense the effective tax rate in 2000 differs from the statutory rate due to the recording of valuation allowances related to state net operating losses and other nondeductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization and to a lesser extent note conversion expense 

  

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized” at december 31 2001 we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards and capital losses we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period 

  

as of december 31 2001 the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments 

  

reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that its net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets as of december 31 2001 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 7400 million in taxable income from january 1 2002 to december 31 2021 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity

in december 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary verestar by sale within the next twelve months in the fourth quarter of 2002 we also committed to a plan to sell flash technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property in july 2002 we consummated the sale of mts components accordingly we presented the results of these operations 602 million and 62 million net of tax as loss from discontinued operations net in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt net 

  

we incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt net in 2000 of 43 million the losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and restatement of our primary credit facilities 30 million net of a tax benefit of 20 million and our early retirement of debt 13 million net of a tax benefit of 09 million no comparable losses were recorded in 2001 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

liquidity overview 

  

our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from equity and debt offerings proceeds from the sale of noncore assets and cash on hand we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements which consist primarily of operational needs debt service and capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and service our cash interest expense we believe cash flow from operations in 2003 will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest payments for that year 

  

in january 2003 we completed an offering discount note offering of approximately 4200 million consisting of 1225 senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 discount notes of ati and warrants to purchase 114 million shares of our class a common stock in connection with the financing we obtained an amendment of our credit facilities credit agreement amendment pursuant to the credit agreement amendment we repaid 2000 million of term loans outstanding under our credit facilities and reduced our revolving loan commitments by 2250 million to 4250 million that amendment also gives us the right to use 2170 million which we have placed in escrow for that purpose to purchase our 225 convertible notes on or prior to october 22 2003 at which time the holders have the right to put those notes to us we may elect to satisfy all or a portion of our obligations with respect to the 225 convertible notes through the issuance of shares of our class a common stock subject to certain restrictions on october 22 2003 pursuant to the put right or prior to that time pursuant to a limited number of privately negotiated transactions we also may use any escrowed funds not used to purchase 225 convertible notes to purchase prior to june 30 2004 our other convertible notes and our senior notes we are required to use any funds remaining in escrow on june 30 2004 to reduce our term loans under the credit facilities 

  

  

we expect our 2003 capital needs to consist primarily of the following debt service including cash interest of approximately 2150 million repayment of approximately 544 million of term loans under our amended credit facilities and up to 2170 million of 225 convertible notes assuming all holders exercise their put rights capital expenditures of between 500 and 750 million and tower acquisitions of approximately 740 million we expect to meet those needs through a combination of cash on hand of approximately 1273 million at december 31 2002 remaining net proceeds from the discount note offering of approximately 1970 million after the repayment of 2000 million of term loans cash generated by operations proceeds from sales of noncore assets and nominal if any borrowings under our credit facilities due to the risk factors outlined above however there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our capital needs without additional borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

uses of liquidity 

  

our principal uses of liquidity in addition to funding operations are debt service and capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions 

  

debt service as of december 31 2002 we had outstanding debt of approximately 35 billion consisting of the following 

  

   

   

   

   

our debt instruments require us to make current interest payments and significant principal payments at their respective maturities in addition in the case of our credit facilities we must make scheduled amortization payments in increasing amounts designed to repay the loans at maturity during 2003 we will be required to repay approximately 136 million of the amended term loans each quarter 

  

prior to maturity there are no mandatory redemption provisions for cash in the senior notes the convertible notes or the discount notes the holders of the convertible notes however have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to maturity but we may at our election pay the repurchase price in cash or by issuing shares of our class a common stock subject to certain conditions in the applicable indenture our credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase convertible notes for cash except that we now have the right to use up to 2170 million to prepay or repurchase the 225 convertible notes and to the extent we do not and are not otherwise required to do so to prepay or repurchase prior to june 30 2004 any of our other convertible notes or our senior notes 

  

tower construction and acquisition needs we have significantly reduced our planned level of tower construction and acquisitions for 2003 from prior years as a result we anticipate that our liquidity needs for new tower development and acquisitions during 2003 will be significantly less than in previous periods 

  

   

   

sources of liquidity 

  

we expect to meet our cash requirements for 2003 through a combination of cash on hand net proceeds from the discount note offering cash generated by operations proceeds from sales of noncore assets and nominal if any borrowings under our credit facilities 

  

  

cash on hand  as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 1273 million in cash on hand as a result of the net proceeds from the discount note offering and the 2000 million repayment of term loans under our credit facilities described above we had approximately 3243 million of cash on hand including 2170 million in escrow as explained above while we have the right to use up to 2170 million of the escrowed funds to purchase the 225 convertible notes we may elect to satisfy all or a portion of our obligations with respect to those notes through the issuance of shares of our class a common stock 

  

cash generated by operations we expect our cash flow needs by segment for 2003 to be as follows excluding cash requirements to fund debt service as interest expense is not allocated to our segments our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2003 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures we expect to use the excess cash generated from these segments principally to service our debt effective december 31 2002 we committed to a plan to dispose of our satellite and fiber network access services segment accordingly these operations are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements the businesses in our former satellite and fiber network access services segment are expected to be near cash flow breakeven from operations but may require additional sources of liquidity to fund minimal capital expenditures until final disposition in addition we currently provide financial guarantees of up to 120 million for certain verestar contractual obligations depending on the terms of any disposition we may continue to be obligated with respect to those guarantees 

  

divestiture proceeds  we are continuing to pursue strategic divestitures of noncore assets in an effort to enhance efficiency and increase our focus on our core tower operations through march 4 2003 we completed approximately 2035 million in noncore asset sales including approximately 785 million subsequent to december 31 2002 related to a our two components businesses b a verestar subsidiary c our corporate office building and other real estate assets and d noncore towers proceeds from those and any future transactions have and will be used to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages to fund capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions we anticipate approximately 500 million of proceeds from additional sales of noncore assets during the remainder of 2003 

  

credit facilities  as of december 31 2002 we had drawn 1600 million of the 6500 million revolving line of credit under our credit facilities the only component of our credit facilities which is not fully drawn we also had outstanding letters of credit of 192 million as of december 31 2002 availability under our revolving line of credit as of december 31 2002 was 4708 million net of 192 million of outstanding letters of credit the credit agreement amendment decreased the revolving loan commitment to 4250 million thereby reducing availability to 2458 million

for the year ended december 31 2002 cash flows provided by operating activities were 1051 million as compared to 261 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the increase is primarily due to an increase in cash flow generated from our rental and management segment coupled with a decrease in our overall investment in working capital 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 cash flows used for investing activities were 1153 million as compared to 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash expended for acquisitions property and equipment and construction activities coupled with an increase in proceeds received from the sale of noncore businesses and assets 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 cash flows provided by financing activities were 1014 million as compared to 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease is primarily related to a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities

we are currently aware that the internal revenue service irs is in the process of auditing certain tax returns filed by cbs and its predecessors including those that relate to american radio and the atc separation transaction in the event that the irs imposes additional tax liabilities on american radio relating to the atc separation we would be obligated to reimburse cbs for such liabilities we cannot currently anticipate or estimate the potential additional tax liabilities if any that may be imposed by the irs however such amounts could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we are not aware of any material obligations relating to this tax indemnity as of december 31 2002 accordingly no amounts have been provided for in the consolidated financial statements relating to this indemnification

factors affecting sources of liquidity 

  

internally generated funds the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are the demand for antennae space on wireless communications towers and for related services our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies 

  

credit facilities   our credit facilities as amended in february 2003 contain certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including limitations on additional debt guarantees dividends and other distributions investments and liens with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving line of credit but would also constitute a default these covenants also restrict our ability as the parent to incur any debt other than that presently outstanding and refinancings of that debt our credit facilities as amended contain five financial tests 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the amended credit facilities also limit our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand 

  

because the credit facilities are with certain of our subsidiaries including ati our senior notes and convertible notes are not included in the computations of any of the tests except in the case of the pro forma debt service and fixed charge coverage tests in which case interest includes the amount of funds that we need our subsidiaries to distribute to us so we can pay interest on our senior notes and our convertible notes annualized operating cash flow is based among other things on four times the operating cash flow for the most recent quarter of our tower rental and management business and trailing 12 months for our other businesses and for corporate general and administrative expenses in the case of the leverage ratio we may include the operating cash flow from brazil and mexico only to the extent of 10 of annualized operating cash flow and we receive credit for only 75 of annualized operating cash flow from our services businesses 

  

  

we were in compliance with the borrowing ratio covenants in effect as of december 31 2002 and as amended by the february 2003 amendment 

  

9 3  8  senior note indenture  the senior note indenture contains certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries which includes all of our subsidiaries other than verestar and its subsidiaries must comply these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions make certain investments and as in the credit facilities use the proceeds from asset sales any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds but would also constitute a default specifically the senior note indenture restricts us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt which excludes debt of verestar and its subsidiaries but includes the liquidation value of certain preferred stock is not greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow however we are permitted even if we are not in compliance with the ratio to incur debt under our credit facilities or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings of them up to 265 billion even if not in compliance with the ratio we are also permitted to among other things have certain types of capital leases and to refund or refinance our convertible notes subject to certain requirements adjusted consolidated cash flow is substantially similar to the definition of annualized operating cash flow as defined in the credit facilities except it applies to us and our subsidiaries other than verestar and its subsidiaries 

  

1225 discount notes  the discount note indenture contains certain restrictive covenants with which ati the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply these include restrictions on the ability to incur additional debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make other distributions make certain investments and as in the credit facilities use the proceeds from asset sales any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds but would also constitute a default specifically the discount note indenture restricts ati each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock however ati the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted to incur debt under our credit facilities or renewals refundings replacements or refinancings of them up to 16 billion they are also permitted among other things to have certain types of capital leases and to refund or refinance existing indebtedness subject to certain requirements 

  

convertible notes the indentures under which our convertible notes are outstanding do not contain any restrictions on among other things the payment of dividends or the making of other distributions the incurrence of debt or liens or the repurchase of our equity securities or any financial covenants 

  

capital markets our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on among other things general economic conditions the condition of the wireless industry our financial performance and the state of the capital markets 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

in december 2001 the sec requested that all registrants disclose their most “critical accounting policies” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the sec indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain further “critical accounting policies” are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 

  

we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of “critical accounting policies” we reviewed our policies for the year ended december 31 2002 and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies with the exception of the asset impairment charges and the adoption of sfas no 142 we did not make any changes to those policies during the year ended december 31 2002 

  

  

   

we intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset from our tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately 8000 million in taxable income from january 1 2003 to december 31 2022 if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or accelerate the utilization of our losses as contemplated in our tax planning strategy we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity 

  

   

assets subject to amortization and noncore assets held for sale  we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 

  

goodwill—assets not subject to amortization  as of january 1 2002 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but reviewed for impairment at least annually sfas no 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test the impairment test is comprised of two steps the initial step is designed to identify potential goodwill impairment by comparing an estimate of fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds fair value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment if any fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for the rental and management segment and former sfna segment and future discounted cash flows and market information in the services segment 

  

  

we completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to our former sfna segment was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in the services segment was impaired as a result we recognized a 5626 million noncash charge net of a tax benefit of 144 million related to the writedown of goodwill to its fair value in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the charge is reflected as of january 1 2002 and included in the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

  

we also completed our annual impairment testing in december 2002 related to the goodwill of the tower rental and management reporting unit that contains goodwill and kline the only services business with remaining goodwill and determined that goodwill was not impaired we obtained an independent third party appraisal of the tower and rental management reporting unit that contains goodwill and utilized market information to value kline 

  

we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test in december of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” this statement establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the related asset retirement costs the requirements of sfas no 143 are effective for us as of january 1 2003 we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2003 and do not expect the impact of adopting this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statement nos 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” upon the adoption of sfas no 145 gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item but rather will generally be classified as part of other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations any such gains or losses classified as extraordinary items in prior periods will be reclassified in future financial statement presentations upon the adoption of sfas no 145 we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 145 for all reporting periods subsequent to january 1 2003 

  

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” the statement requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of the commitment to an exit or disposal plan the requirements of sfas no 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after january 1 2003 we will apply the provisions of this statement to all restructuring activity initiated after january 1 2003 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure—an amendment of sfas no 123” which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 123 in addition the statement mandates certain new disclosures that are incremental to those required by sfas no 123 we will continue to account for stockbased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 as such we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we have adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 148 as of december 31 2002 see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation for variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” which requires all variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the vie in addition the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests but not the majority fin 46 is effective for all vie’s created or acquired after january 31 2003 for vie’s created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations

item 1 business

overview

   we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure
company our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant
communication towers to wireless and broadcast companies we operate the
largest portfolio of wireless communications towers in north america and are
the largest independent operator of broadcast towers in north america based on
number of towers our tower portfolio provides us with a substantial recurring
base of leasing revenues from our existing customers the additional capacity
to add more antennae to these towers and the network of towers capable of
addressing the needs of wireless service providers on a national basis

   to complement our core business of leasing antennae space we also provide a
full array of related services including network design radio frequency
engineering site acquisition zoning tower construction component parts
antennae and line installation maintenance and tower monitoring these
capabilities enable us to provide a full service solution to our customers
tower infrastructure needs and generate related revenues that are additive to
our core leasing business in addition our service capabilities enable us to
respond costeffectively to demand for new towers by giving us the flexibility
to construct and operate our own towers at costs to us that are generally less
than acquiring towers

   our goal is to capitalize on the increasing use of wireless communication
services by actively marketing space available for leasing on our existing
towers providing related tower services to our leasing customers and
selectively developing or acquiring new towers that meet our return on
investment criteria we target as customers financially sound wireless service
providers that are improving or extending their infrastructure

   we operate our business in three segments rental and management network
development services and satellite and fiber network access services our
operating revenues and divisional cash flows for the year ended december 31
2001 were 11 billion and 3005 million respectively our three business
segments accounted for the following percentages of operating revenues and
divisional cash flows for the year ended december 31 2001

   our rental and management segment tower leasing activities generate the
highest profit margins we believe those activities are likely to grow more
rapidly than our other segments because of increased utilization of our
existing towers for more financial information about our business segments and
geographic information about our operating revenues and longlived assets see
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in
this annual report

strategy

   our strategy is to capitalize on the increasing use of wireless
communication services from december 1995 to december 2000 the number of
wireless phone subscribers increased from 338 million to 1095 million and the

                                      2

page

minutes of use of wireless phone services increased from 378 billion to 2589
billion among major wireless carriers in the united states during the same
period the number of cell sites increased from 22700 to 104300 sites we
expect that the continued growth of wireless subscribers and minutes of use of
wireless phone services will further require wireless carriers to add a
significant number of additional cell sites to maintain the performance of
their networks in the areas in which they currently cover in addition we
believe that when data wireless services such as email and internet access
are deployed on a widespread basis they will require wireless carriers to
increase further the cell density of their existing networks and require
geographical expansion of their network coverage to meet this demand we
believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their tower infrastructure
needs as a means of speeding access to their markets and preserving capital
rather than constructing and operating their own towers and maintaining their
own tower service and development capabilities

   we believe that our existing portfolio of towers our tower related services
and network development capabilities and our management team position us to
benefit from these trends and to play an increasing role in addressing the
needs of wireless service providers and broadcasters the key elements of our
strategy include

   maximize utilization of our tower capacity  we believe that our existing
   portfolio of towers provides us with a significant base to continue our
   organic growth in our rental and management business by leasing additional
   antennae space on these towers organic same tower revenues and cash flows
   growth in our rental and management segment for the 8751 towers that we
   owned both at the beginning of the fourth quarter 2000 and at the beginning
   of the fourth quarter 2001 was 20 and 26 respectively we anticipate
   continuing to grow our revenues and cash flows because many of our towers
   have significant capacity available for additional antenna space rental that
   we can utilize at low incremental costs to us because the costs of
   operating a tower are largely fixed increasing utilization significantly
   improves tower operating margins we will continue to use our targeted sales
   and marketing techniques to increase utilization of and investment return
   on our existing towers

   leverage our extensive tower service capabilities  we intend to use our
   extensive service capabilities to generate related revenues that are
   additive to our core leasing business and to minimize the cost of any new
   tower sites we may add based on our return on investment criteria tenants
   who lease antenna space on our towers need a variety of additional products
   and services including network design radio frequency engineering site
   acquisition zoning tower construction component parts antennae and line
   installation maintenance and tower monitoring tenants often outsource some
   or all of these services to third parties including us we believe our
   ability to offer a full array of products and services and our preexisting
   relationship with the tenants on our towers position us well to provide
   these products and services and to capture more incremental revenues

   we also intend to take advantage of our extensive experience and
   capabilities as a developer of new towers when responding to demand by
   wireless carriers for new towers we can construct and operate towers at
   costs to us that are generally less than the cost related to acquiring
   towers this costefficiency enables us to reduce the average cost to own
   and operate our towers as a result we plan to emphasize selective new
   tower development for the foreseeable future in responding to demand by
   wireless carriers

   continue our focus on customer service  since speed to market and reliable
   network performance are critical components to the success of wireless
   service providers our ability to assist our customers in meeting their
   goals will ultimately define our success to that end we intend to continue
   to focus on our customer service by for example reducing cycle time for
   key functions such as lease processing and antennae and line installations


   build on strong relationship with major wireless carriers  our
   understanding of the network needs of our wireless carrier customers and our
   ability to convey effectively how we can satisfy those needs is key


  subscriber and use information includes only cellular personal
   communication services and enhanced specialized mobile radio wireless
   services the term cell site above refers to the number of antennae and
   related equipment in commercial operation not the number of towers on which
   that equipment is attached

   to our efforts to add new antennae leases crosssell our services and win
   desirable new tower development projects we are building on our strong
   relationship with our customers to gain more familiarity with their evolving
   network plans so we can identify opportunities where our nationwide
   portfolio of towers extensive service offerings and seasoned construction
   capabilities can be used to satisfy their needs we believe that we are well
   positioned to be a preferred partner to major wireless carriers in leasing
   tower space and new tower development projects because of our proven
   operating experience and the national scope of our tower portfolio and
   services

   employ selective criteria for new tower construction and acquisitions  we
   believe that the unused capacity of our existing tower portfolio is capable
   of addressing the current needs of many wireless service providers because
   of this capacity and our desire to increase the near term returns on our
   capital we have adopted more selective criteria for new tower development
   and acquisitions we expect that the application of these new criteria will
   increase our return on investments in new towers we build or acquire

   actively manage our tower portfolio  we plan to pursue exchanges and sales
   of towers or tower clusters with other tower operators and other entities
   our goal is to enhance operating efficiencies by either acquiring towers in
   regions where we have insufficient coverage or disposing or exchanging
   towers in areas where we do not have operating economies of scale if we are
   successful in disposing of certain tower assets we may redeploy proceeds
   received in more productive tower assets

operational initiatives

   in the latter half of 2001 the major wireless carriers reduced their
planned capital expenditures for geographic network expansion in the near
term we expect wireless carriers to make capital expenditures primarily to
increase the density of their current network coverage and improve the quality
of service to their existing subscribers while selectively investing to expand
network coverage we believe that the increasing minutes of use of wireless
phone service and number of wireless phone subscribers will continue to require
wireless carriers to add a significant number of additional cell sites to
maintain the performance of their networks in the areas which they currently
cover

   because we believe that our existing tower portfolio has the scope and
available capacity to address a significant portion of these needs we have
lowered our planned capital expenditures for 2002 on new tower development and
acquisitions our 2002 capital budget provides for total expenditures of
approximately 2000 million to 2250 million which includes towers to be
built under existing buildtosuit agreements compared to total capital
expenditures of approximately 5680 million in 2001 in contrast to 2001
during which we built approximately 1300 towers including five broadcast
towers our 2002 plans call for the construction of between 400 and 500 towers
including nine broadcast towers in addition we have adopted more selective
criteria for new tower development we will not undertake new tower development
unless the project is likely to meet our heightened near term return on
investment criteria

products and services

we offer our products and services through three business segments

      rental and management

      network development services and

      satellite and fiber network access services


                                      4

rental and management

   leasing of antennae sites  our primary business is renting antenna space to
wireless and broadcast companies on multitenant communications towers we
operate a tower network of approximately 14500 multi user sites in the united
states mexico and brazil including more than 300 broadcast tower sites
approximately 13600 of these towers are owned or leased sites and
approximately 900 are managed sites or leasesublease sites under which we hold
a position as lessee that is coterminus with a related sublease our networks
in the united states and mexico are national in scope our us network spans
49 states and the district of columbia in addition 83 of our us network
provides coverage in the top 100 markets or core areas such as high traffic
interstate corridors our mexican network includes more than 1100 sites in
highly populated areas including mexico city monterrey guadalajara and
acapulco our brazilian network is located in the highgrowth southern part of
brazil as well as in certain northern and centralwestern cities that have a
total population of approximately 400 million

   we lease antenna space on our towers to tenants in a diverse range of
wireless communications and broadcast industries wireless industries we serve
include personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized
mobile radio specialized mobile radio paging fixed microwave and fixed
wireless our major customers include alltel att wireless services cingular
wireless nextel sprint pcs verizon and voicestream

   the number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on
whether the tower is broadcast or nonbroadcast and on the towers location
height and the loaded capacity at certain wind speeds an antennas height on
a tower and the towers location determine the lineofsight of the antenna
with the horizon and consequently the distance a signal can be transmitted
some of our customers including paging companies and specialized mobile radio
providers in rural areas need higher elevations for broader coverage other
customers such as personal communications services enhanced specialized
mobile radio and cellular companies in metropolitan areas usually do not need
to place their equipment at the highest tower point we believe that many well
engineered and well located towers built to serve the specifications of an
initial anchor tenant in the wireless communications sector will attract three
or more wireless tenants over time thereby increasing revenue and enhancing
margins

   lease terms  our leases like most of those in the industry generally vary
depending upon the region and the industry user television and radio
broadcasters prefer longterm leases while wireless communications providers
favor leases in the range of five to ten years in duration in both cases the
leases often have multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant

   tenants tend to renew their leases because of the complications and costs
associated with moving antennae for example in the case of cellular personal
communications services and other wireless users moving one antennae might
necessitate moving or adjusting several others because of the interlocking
gridlike nature of wireless systems moreover a move by a television or radio
broadcaster would necessitate fcc approval and could entail major dislocations
and the uncertainty associated with building antennae in new coverage areas in
addition the increasing difficulty of obtaining local zoning approvals the
increasing environmental concerns of communities and the restrictions imposed
by the federal aviation administration and fcc tend to reduce the number of
choices available to a tower user

   most of our leases have escalator provisions these automatic increases are
most frequently based on a fixed amount they are also sometimes based on
increases in the consumer price index

   annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon

      size of the transmission line and the number and weight of the antennae
       on the tower

      geographic location of the tower

      existing capacity of the tower

      the placement of the customers antenna on the tower

      frequency spectrum

      the location and height of the tower on which antenna space is rented
       and

      the competitive environment

   tower development  historically cellular and other wireless service
providers had constructed and owned a majority of the towers for their antennae
needs rather than leasing space on towers from a third party beginning a few
years ago wireless service providers expressed a growing interest in having
independent companies own and operate the towers for their antennae this trend
resulted in our entering into agreements with a number of wireless carriers to
construct and subsequently lease space on towers in key areas identified as
optimal for their network expansion requirements in most cases because we own
the constructed towers we are able to lease space on them to other tenants as
well as to the anchor tenant

   communications site management business  we are a leading manager of
communications sites a central aspect of this business is the development by
us of new sources of revenue for building owners by effectively managing all
aspects of rooftop and ground tower telecommunications including rooftop
infrastructure construction services

   our management contracts for these sites are generally for a period of five
years and contain automatic fiveyear renewal periods subject to termination
by either party before renewal under these contracts we are responsible for a
wide range of activities including marketing antennae sites on the tower
reviewing existing and negotiating future license agreements with tenant users
managing and enforcing those agreements supervising repairs and maintenance
and installation of equipment by tenants and site billing collections and
contract administration for such services we are entitled to a percentage of
lease payments which is higher for new tenants than for existing tenants

network development services

   through atc integrated services we provide comprehensive network
development services for both wireless service providers and broadcasters we
offer full turnkey network development solutions to our customers including
network design radio frequency engineering site acquisition zoning tower
construction component parts antennae and line installation maintenance and
tower monitoring we provide network development services to most of the major
wireless service providers and have constructed or are constructing towers for
a variety of wireless and broadcast companies we also construct towers for our
rental and management segment

   our ability to provide this full range of services is an important component
in our business model because these services

      enhance our overall returns as our costs for constructing towers for our
       rental and management segment are generally lower than those we acquire

      strengthen our existing customer relationships by increasing our
       knowledge of their network needs which we believe leads to greater
       customer satisfaction and the opportunity to offer them other services

      increase recurring revenues and cash flow from our towers and

      make us a more attractive choice for turnkey projects since we believe
       wireless carriers prefer to work with a national company rather than
       contract with multiple vendors to address their towerrelated needs

   construction and antennae and line installation  we are one of the leading
builders of wireless and broadcast towers our atc tower services unit has over
30 years of wireless tower construction and equipment installation experience
we also own and operate kline iron  steel an experienced steel fabricator and
builder of broadcast towers the following table shows the approximate number
of towers that we constructed utilizing various areas of expertise within our
network development services segment for our own account during 1999 2000
and 2001 and our projection for 2002



                                                number of towers
               year                               constructed

               2000       1600
               2001       1300
               2002projection     400500


   for third party construction we bill customers on a fixed price or time and
materials basis and we may negotiate fees on individual sites or for groups of
sites the cost of construction of a tower varies both by site location and
terrain tower type and height and any governmental or environmental
requirements nonbroadcast towers whether on a rooftop or the ground
generally cost between 200000 and 250000 broadcast towers are generally
much taller and are built to bear a greater load the costs of broadcast towers
are significantly greater than nonbroadcast towers and vary considerably based
on size location and terrain

   as part of our construction services and as a separate service offering we
provide antennae and line installation and maintenance services these services
use not only our constructionrelated skills but also our technical expertise
to ensure that new installations do not cause interference with other tenants
we believe that in 2002 our antennae and line installation services and
maintenance capabilities will provide us with a significant opportunity to
capture incremental revenue on existing and newly built sites as carriers
shift their focus from geographic network expansion to maximizing their
existing network capacity

   kline iron  steel also performs nontower related steel fabrication
including its current work on a large office project pursuant to a multiyear
agreement

   wireless components  we sell tower related parts and equipment to wireless
and broadcast companies including antennae fasteners and other mounting
components waveguide bridge products square support rail tower lighting
systems and tower safety products we also manufacture wireless components for
several large wireless communications equipment vendors who market these
products under their own brand names

   engineering consulting services and network design  we provide a number of
engineering services that enable our customers to plan new wireless networks
modify existing tower networks and improve the quality of their networks
these engineering services include design of wireless broadband and data and
radio frequency networks drive testing performance engineering and wireless
broadband and data network design and implementation upgrading networks to the
next generation of broadcast technology which is often referred to as 3g or
thirdgeneration technologies transport engineering and interconnection and
microwave services

   site acquisition and zoning services  we engage in site acquisition
services for our own account in connection with tower development projects and
other proprietary construction as well as for third parties the site
selection and acquisition process begins with the network design we identify
highway corridors population centers and topographical features within the
carriers existing or proposed network we then select the most suitable sites
based on demographics traffic patterns and signal characteristics upon
customer approval of the site we typically provide zoning related services
working with the local zoningplanning board to obtain the necessary approval
if we receive approval our customer typically engages us to supervise the
construction of the towers or to construct the towers ourselves

reducing infrastructure costs consolidating transponder space and
renegotiating certain transponder agreements these initiatives are designed to
improve verestars operating margins and position verestar for structural
independence

significant agreements

   we are a party to three agreements that we consider to be material to our
business

   alltel transaction  in december 2000 we entered into an agreement with
alltel to sublease up to 2193 communications towers through a 15year sublease
agreement for up to 6579 million in cash as of december 31 2001 we had
subleased 1748 towers and paid alltel 5244 million in cash during the first
quarter of 2002 we closed on 28 towers and paid alltel 84 million in cash
as permitted by the agreement we have decided not to sublease the remaining
417 towers the alltel towers are located primarily in the southeast and to a
lesser extent in the midwest region of the united states

   we are entitled to all income generated from leasing space on the towers and
are responsible for all expenses including ground rent alltel has reserved
space on the towers for its antennae for which it pays a site maintenance fee
of 1200 per tower per month escalating at a rate equal to the lower of 5
per annum or the increase in consumer price index plus 4 per annum

                                      8

   we have an option to purchase the 1776 towers subleased from alltel at the
end of the 15year sublease term the purchase price per tower will at
alltels option be 27500 plus interest accrued at 3 per annum payable in
cash or 769 shares of our class a common stock

   as part of the transaction we entered into a fiveyear exclusive
buildtosuit agreement that gives us the right but not the obligation to
develop towers for alltel we also entered into a separate master lease with
alltel for the buildtosuit towers the initial term is ten years except for
our sites that were not constructed pursuant to the buildtosuit agreement
for which it is for five years alltel has three fiveyear renewal options the

stock these towers are located in all of airtouchs major markets other than
los angeles and san diego including albuquerque atlanta cleveland denver
detroit minneapolis omaha phoenix portland sacramento and seattle

   we are entitled to all income generated from leasing space on the towers and
are responsible for all tower expenses including ground rent airtouch has
reserved space on the towers for its antennae for which it has agreed to pay
us a site maintenance charge equal to 1500 per month for each nonmicrowave
reserved space and 385 per month for each microwave reserved space with 3
annual increases

   we have also entered into an exclusive threeyear buildtosuit agreement
with airtouch expiring in 2002 under that agreement we have the right to
construct and own all of airtouchs towers in all markets covered by the
agreement airtouch entered into a separate master lease covering all towers to
be constructed pursuant to the buildtosuit agreement airtouch will lease
space for a period of ten years and has the option to extend each lease for
five fiveyear periods the rent is 1500 per month for each nonmicrowave
antenna site and 385 per month for each microwave antenna site with 3 annual
increases

   att transaction  pursuant to a september 1999 agreement we purchased
1931 towers from att for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2582
million in cash these towers are located throughout the united states and were
constructed by att for its microwave operations

   att entered into a master lease agreement with us covering 468 of these
towers on which it then conducted microwave operations the aggregate annual
base rent payment is approximately 10 million payable in january of each
lease year the master lease agreements provides that we will adjust but not
below the base rent the rent payable by att based on its actual usage of the
towers

   as part of this transaction we entered into a buildtosuit agreement that
gives us the right but not the obligation to develop towers for att wireless
services we entered into a separate master lease with att wireless services
for the buildtosuit towers the initial term is ten years and att wireless
services has three fiveyear renewal options the rent for lease supplements

7822 million related to the acquisition of tower assets 368 million
related to our purchase of network development services business and 82
million related to verestar this total purchase price includes approximately
8096 million in cash and 377394 shares of our class a common stock other
than the alltel transaction described above none of these acquisitions was
material

   in may 2001 we expanded our tower network into brazil as atc brazil our
brazilian subsidiary entered into arrangements with global village telecom
ltd gvt for the acquisition of the rights to approximately 156
communications towers from gvt for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
292 million as part of those arrangements we entered into a buildtosuit
agreement and a master lease agreement providing for the leasing of space to
gvt on the towers we own or control in brazil under the arrangements we are
entitled to all income generated by and responsible for all expenses of the
towers for a period of 35 years with an option to purchase the towers after
seven years

management organization

   our corporate headquarters is in boston massachusetts our rental and
management segment is organized on a regional basis with each region being
headed by a vice president who reports to our executive vice president of tower
operations who in turn reports to our president and chief operating officer
our current regional centers are based in boston atlanta chicago houston
the san francisco bay area and mexico city our regional centers are further
subdivided into 18 area operations centers we are currently in the process of
completing a reorganization of our regional centers to consolidate lease
administration accounting and various administrative and developmental
functions upon completion of this reorganization our regional centers will be
focused on sales operations customer service and tower development we
believe our regional and area operations centers are capable of responding
effectively to the opportunities and customer needs of their defined geographic
areas our area operations centers are staffed with skilled engineering
construction management and marketing personnel

   our network development services segment has its headquarters in waterbury
connecticut and is headed by president atc integrated services who reports to
our president and chief operating officer our satellite and fiber network
access services segment maintains its headquarters in washington dc and is
headed by its president who reports to our chairman and chief executive officer

history

   in early 1995 steven b dodge the then chairman of the board president
and chief executive officer of american radio systems corporation and other
members of its management recognized the opportunity in the communications
site industry as a consequence of its ownership and operation of broadcast
towers american radio formed our company to capitalize on this opportunity
american radio distributed its stock in our company to its securityholders in
connection with its merger with cbs in june 1998

regulatory matters

   towers  both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless
communications and radio and television broadcasting these regulations govern
the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors
such as height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new
antenna structures or modifications to existing antenna structures must be
reviewed by the faa prior to initiation to ensure that the structure will not
present a hazard to aircraft navigation after the faa issues a no hazard
determination the tower owner must register the antenna structure with the fcc
and paint and light the structure in accordance with the faa determination the
faa review and the fcc registration processes are prerequisites to fcc
authorization of communications devices placed on the antenna structure

   the fcc separately regulates and licenses wireless communications devices
operating on towers based upon the particular frequency used in addition the
fcc separately licenses and regulates television and radio

                                      10

page

stations broadcasting from towers tower owners bear the responsibility for
notifying the faa of any tower lighting failures and the repair of those
lighting failures tower owners also must notify the fcc when the ownership of
a tower changes we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to
comply with applicable standards failure to comply with applicable
towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties

   in january 2001 the fcc concluded investigations of several operators of
communications towers including us the fcc sent us a notice of apparent
liability for forfeiture nal preliminarily determining that we had failed
to file certain informational forms had failed to properly post certain
information at various tower sites and on one occasion had failed to properly
light a tower the fcc also ordered an additional review of our overall
procedures for and degree of compliance with the fccs regulations we reached
a settlement with the fcc regarding the compliance issues arising out of the
nal in the form of a consent decree as part of the consent decree the fcc has
rescinded the nal and terminated the further investigation ordered in the nal
in september 2001 we made a voluntary contribution of 03 million to the us
treasury and agreed to maintain an active compliance plan failure to comply
with the consent decree may lead to monetary penalties and loss of the right to
hold our various registrations and licenses

   the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by
limiting state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the
construction modification and placement of wireless communications towers the
law preserves local zoning authority but prohibits any action that would
discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether
the construction modification or placement of communications towers it also
prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of
radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with the fcc
regulations the 1996 telecom act also requires the federal government to help
licensees of wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites
for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments
work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower
facilities

   local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning
restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities these
regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners andor licensees
to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations
prior to tower construction or collocations on existing towers local zoning
authorities generally have been hostile to construction in their communities
and these regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction colocations
or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer
demand in addition those regulations increase costs associated with new tower
construction and colocation existing regulatory policies may adversely affect
the timing or cost of new tower construction and colocations and additional
regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs
to us these factors could adversely affect our construction program and
operations

   our tower operations in mexico and brazil are also subject to regulation if
we pursue additional international opportunities we will be subject to
regulations in additional foreign jurisdictions in addition our customers
both domestic and foreign also may be subject to new regulatory policies that
may adversely affect the demand for communications sites

   verestar  we are required to obtain authorization from the fcc for our use
of radio frequencies to provide satellite and wireless services in the united
states we are also required to obtain authorizations from foreign regulatory
agencies in connection with our provision of these services abroad we hold a
number of pointtopoint microwave radio licenses that are used to provide
telecommunications services additionally we hold a number of satellite earth
station licenses in connection with our operation of satellitebased networks
we are required to obtain consent from the fcc prior to assigning these
licenses or transferring control of any of our companies holding an fcc license

   we also provide maritime communications services pursuant to a special
temporary authority from the fcc but we have not been able to obtain a
permanent license from the fcc or any other sovereign nation holding the
registration of the vessels from which we operate the fcc has issued a notice
of inquiry which

                                      11

page

invites comments on possible licensing methods applicable to earth stations on
vessels operating within united states territory it is possible that this
proceeding could lead to other fcc actions including without limitation a
notice of proposed rulemaking that could result in regulations that are
restrictive and costly to our operations in addition the special temporary
authority currently being used may not be renewed for future terms

environmental matters

   our operations are subject to federal state and local and foreign laws
relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation
of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and
waste as the owner andor operator of real property and facilities we may
have liability under those laws for the costs of investigation removal or
remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or
wastes certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability
without regard to whether we as the owner or operator knew of or were
responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued
operations or sold the property we may also be subject to common law claims by
third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of
contamination

   in addition some environmental regulations affect the registration of
communications towers with the fcc the fccs decision to register a proposed
tower may be subject to environmental review under the national environmental
policy act of 1969 nepa which requires federal agencies to evaluate the
environmental impacts of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc
has issued regulations implementing nepa as well as the national historic
preservation act the endangered species act and the american indian religious
freedom act these regulations place responsibility on each applicant to
investigate potential environmental and other effects of operations and to
disclose any significant effects in an environmental assessment prior to
constructing a tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed tower would
have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has
developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact
statement this process could significantly delay the registration of a
particular tower in january 2002 the fccs wireless bureau dismissed for
lack of standing challenges to the registration of seven of our towers filed
by certain environmental groups the challenges alleged that we had failed to
comply with nepa and that the fccs rules implementing nepa are inadequate the
petitioners have appealed the bureaus decision to the fcc if the bureaus
decision is overturned we could be subject to monetary penalties or increased
compliance obligations

   as previously disclosed in october 2001 we entered into a settlement
agreement with a local district attorney in california the county had filed a
civil suit against us alleging that we had failed to make certain filings and
maintain certain records relating to environmental compliance and hazardous
materials as a result of the settlement agreement we paid the county 02
million and agreed to maintain an active compliance plan we have not received
any other written notice from any governmental authority or third party
asserting and we are not otherwise aware of any material environmental
noncompliance liability or claim

competition and new technologies

   rental and management segment competition  we compete for antennae site
customers with other national independent tower companies wireless carriers
that own and operate their own tower networks and lease tower space to other
carriers site development companies that acquire space on existing towers for
wireless service providers and manage new tower construction and traditional
local independent tower operators we believe that tower location and capacity
price and quality of service historically have been and will continue to be the
most significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers
of communications sites in january 2002 the united states supreme court
upheld the fccs determination that wireless carriers are entitled to mandatory
access on utility poles and regulated rates for those attachments while we do
not believe that utility poles are an adequate substitute for our towers we
are unable to predict whether the courts decision will cause a reduction in
our leasing business

                                      12

page

   network development services segment competition  our network development
services compete with a variety of companies offering individual or
combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site
acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway
consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio
frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which
provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and
carriers internal staffs we believe that carriers base their decisions on
network development services on various criteria including a companys
experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a
project various elements of our components business compete with numerous
other companies kline iron  steel competes with numerous other steel
fabricators many of which have substantially greater financial and other
resources

   satellite and fiber network access services segment competition  we compete
with other full service teleports in the united states satellite
communications companies and other communications service providers
competition is based primarily on reliability price transmission quality and
the ability to offer complete solutions some of verestars existing and
potential competitors consist of companies from whom verestar currently leases
satellite and fiber network access in connection with its providing services to
its customers increased competition could result in verestar being forced to
reduce its fees and may limit its ability to obtain on economical terms
services that are critical to its business verestars competitors may develop
or acquire services that provide functionality similar to that provided by
verestars services and that those competitive services may be offered at
significantly lower prices or bundled with other services many of verestars
existing and potential competitors have financial and other resources
significantly greater than those available to it in the maritime
telecommunications market verestar competes primarily with several companies
certain of which have fcc licenses that are similar to verestars and own their
own satellites

   we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors
relating to each of our business segments

   new technologies  the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need
for towerbased transmission and reception and may thereby have a negative
impact on our operations for example the development and implementation of
signal combining technologies which permit one antenna to service two
different frequencies of transmission and thereby two customers may reduce
the need for towerbased broadcast transmission and hence demand for tower
space technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or
smart antennas can increase the capacity at existing sites and can reduce the
number of additional sites a given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber
base in addition the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for
towerbased transmission and reception and have an adverse effect on our
operations similarly the growth in delivery of video services by direct
broadcast satellites could reduce the demand for tower space indoor
distribution systems relieve some capacity on existing networks and could have
an adverse effect on our operations capacity enhancing technologies such as
lowerrate vocoders and more spectrally efficient airlink standards potentially
relieve network capacity problems without adding sites and could adversely
effect our operations

   any increase in the use of network sharing or roaming or resale arrangements
by wireless service providers could adversely affect the demand for tower
space these arrangements enable a provider to serve customers outside its
license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements
to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to
enter the wireless marketplace wireless service providers might consider such
sharing or roaming and resale arrangements superior to constructing their own
facilities or leasing our antenna space conversely in some cases network
sharing arrangements may stimulate network development in areas where a single
carrier network is economically unattractive

construction manufacturing and raw materials

   we build maintain and install land based wireless communications and
broadcast transmitting and receiving facilities by obtaining sheet metal and
other raw material parts and components from a variety of vendors we

                                      13

page

also engage third party contract manufacturers to construct certain of these
facilities we have historically obtained the majority of our sheet metal and
other raw materials parts and components including for our components
business from a limited number of suppliers however substantially all of
these items are available from numerous other suppliers we have not to date
experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining the needed quantities of
materials from suppliers in a timely manner

employees

   as of december 31 2001 we employed approximately 3200 full time
individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

factors that may affect future results

   we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
risks some of which are beyond our control the following discussion
highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results

decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our
operating results and we cannot control that demand

   many of the factors affecting the demand for tower space and to a lesser
extent our services business materially affect our operating results those
factors include

      consumer demand for wireless services

      the financial condition of wireless service providers and their
       preference for owning rather than leasing antenna sites

      the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or
       increase their capital expenditures

      the growth rate of wireless communications or of a particular wireless
       segment

      the number of wireless service providers in a particular segment
       nationally or locally

      governmental licensing of broadcast rights

      mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers

      increased use of network sharing arrangements or roaming and resale
       arrangements by wireless service providers

      delays or changes in the deployment of 3g or other technologies

      zoning environmental health and other government regulations and

      technological changes

the demand for antenna space is dependent to a significantly lesser extent on
the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things
technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio
may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission we could also be
affected adversely should the development of digital television be delayed or
impaired or if demand for it were to be less than anticipated because of
delays disappointing technical performance or cost to the consumer

continuation of the current us economic slowdown could materially and
adversely affect our business

   the existing slowdown in the economy has negatively affected the factors
described under the prior heading influencing demand for tower space and tower
related services for example the slowdown coupled with the deterioration of
the capital markets has caused certain wireless service providers to delay
and in certain

                                      14

page

cases abandon expansion and upgrading of wireless networks implementation of
new systems or introduction of new technologies the economic slowdown has
also harmed and may continue to harm the financial condition of some wireless
service providers many wireless service providers operate with substantial
leverage and some wireless service providers including customers of ours have
filed for bankruptcy

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our
cash flow and our ability to make payments on our debt

   we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness as of december 31
2001 we had approximately 36 billion of consolidated debt we will be
required to borrow additional funds during 2002 to fund our construction
program even at the significantly reduced activity level that we anticipate
and other capital expenditures we anticipate aggregate incremental borrowing
needs for 2002 and 2003 of under 2000 million

   our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences
including

      our being unable to meet one or more of the financial ratios contained
       in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or
       principal including periodic principal amortization payments which
       events could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding
       debt as a result of crossdefault provisions

      increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
       conditions

      limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing

      requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from
       operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash
       flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures

      requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our
       core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations

      limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our
       business and the industries in which we compete and

      placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged
       competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital
       resources

   a significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating
rates as a result our interest payment obligations on that debt will increase
if interest rates increase

restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior notes could
adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and causing us to breach
our tower development obligations

   the indenture for our senior notes and our credit facilities contain
restrictive covenants and in the case of the credit facilities requirements
of complying with certain leverage and other financial tests these limit our
ability to take various actions including the incurrence of additional debt
and engage in various types of transactions including mergers and sales of
assets these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by
limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development
merger and acquisition or other opportunities

   we are a party to a number of buildtosuit agreements with wireless
carriers that obligate us to develop new tower sites at the direction of the
wireless carrier subject to previously agreed upon approval criteria we do
not expect to have the ability to fund our planned level of capital
expenditures with our operating cash flows until during 2003 and hence we will
need to borrow under our credit facilities until then to do so we must comply
with various financial tests if we are not able to fund our capital
expenditures through this borrowing under our credit

                                      15

facilities we might have to attempt to raise money in the debt or equity
capital markets alternatively we would be required to dispose of assets on
terms that might not be favorable to us or to curtail our construction
activities that curtailment could adversely affect us if it caused us to
breach any of our buildtosuit agreements because we could be subject to
penalties damage claims and contract terminations

if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other
to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to generate
positive cash flows could be adversely affected

   significant consolidation among our wireless service providers customers may
result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing
networks of many wireless carriers overlap as do their expansion plans
similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in
extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to
leasing our antennae space in december 2001 the fcc announced that the
spectrum cap which previously prohibited wireless carriers from owning more
than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area would be removed in
january 2003 some wireless carriers may be encouraged to consolidate with each
other as a result of this regulatory change and as a means to strengthen their
financial condition consolidation among wireless carriers would also increase
our risk that the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially
decrease revenues and cash flows

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower
industry is sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants

   due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the
tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our
tenants during the past two years several of our customers have filed for
bankruptcy although to date these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse
effect on our business or revenues many wireless service providers operate
with substantial leverage if one or more of our major lease customers
experienced financial difficulties it could result in uncollectable accounts
receivable and our loss of significant customers and anticipated lease revenues

increasing competition in the satellite and fiber network access services
market may adversely affect verestars business

   verestar competes with other satellite communications companies that provide
similar services as well as other communications service providers some of
its existing and potential competitors are companies from whom verestar
currently leases satellite and fiber network access in order to provide
services to its customers increased competition could force verestar to reduce
its fees and may limit its ability to obtain on economical terms services
that are critical to its business verestars competitors may develop or
acquire services that provide functionality similar to that provided by
verestars services and these competitive services may be offered at
significantly lower prices or bundled with other services many existing and
potential competitors have financial and other resources significantly greater
than those available to verestar

if our chief executive officer left we would be adversely affected because we
rely on his reputation and expertise

   the loss of our chief executive officer steven b dodge has a greater
likelihood of having a material adverse effect upon us than it would on most
other companies of our size because of our reliance on mr dodges expertise
our growth strategy is highly dependent on the efforts of mr dodge our
ability even when capital markets are more receptive than they presently are
to raise capital also depends significantly on the reputation of mr dodge you
should be aware that we do not have an employment agreement with mr dodge

our foreign operations could create expropriation governmental regulation
funds inaccessibility foreign exchange exposure and management problems

   our expansion into mexico and brazil and any other possible foreign
operations in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and
operational problems not experienced in the united states we have made

                                      16

page

a substantial loan to a mexican company own towers in mexico and are committed
to construct a sizable number of towers in that country we have also acquired
the rights to 156 communications towers in brazil and entered into a
buildtosuit agreement to construct towers in that country we may should
economic and capital market conditions improve also engage in comparable
transactions in other countries in the future among the risks of foreign
operations are governmental expropriation and regulation inability to
repatriate earnings or other funds currency fluctuations difficulty in
recruiting trained personnel and language and cultural differences all of
which could adversely affect our operations

new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable
to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues

   the development and implementation of signal combining technologies which
permit one antenna to service two different transmission frequencies and
thereby two customers may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast
transmission and hence demand for our antenna space technologies that enhance
spectral capacity such as beam forming or smart antennas can increase the
capacity at existing sites and can reduce the number of additional sites a
given carrier needs to serve any given subscriber base

   in addition the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for
towerbased transmission and reception and have an adverse effect on our
operations the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast
satellites could also adversely affect demand for our antenna space

   indoor distribution systems relieve some capacity on existing networks and
could have an adverse effect on our operations capacity enhancing technologies
such as lowerrate vocoders and more spectrally efficient airlink standards
potentially relieve network capacity problems without adding sites and could
adversely effect our operations

we could have liability under environmental laws

   under various federal state and local environmental laws we as an owner
lessee or operator of more than 14500 real estate sites may be liable for the
substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous
wastes for a discussion of our risks relating to environmental matters see
environmental matters above

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or
future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business
as we currently do

   we are subject to federal state and local and foreign regulation of our
business both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless
communications and radio and television antennae and the fcc separately
regulates wireless communication devices operating on towers similar
regulations exist in mexico brazil and other foreign countries regarding
wireless communications and the operation of communications towers local
zoning authorities generally have been hostile to construction in their
communities and these regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction
colocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond
to customer demand existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the
timing or cost of new tower construction and locations and additional
regulations may be adopted which increase delays or result in additional costs
to us these factors could adversely affect our construction program and
operations for a more complete discussion of the regulatory risks affecting
the various aspects of our business including the consent decree see
regulatory matters above

                                      17

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived
health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are
substantiated

   public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and
other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless
companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public
perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could
slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services

   if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health
effects including cancer were established our operations costs and revenues
would be materially and adversely affected we do not maintain any significant
insurance with respect to these matters









item 2  properties

   our corporate headquarters are at 116 huntington avenue boston
massachusetts where we occupy approximately 41000 square feet of office space
in a building that we own a description of the principal properties of each of
our business segments is as follows

      our rental and management segment owns an aggregate of approximately
       171000 square feet and leases an aggregate of approximately 82000
       square feet of office space in atlanta the chicago metropolitan area
       houston the san francisco bay area san paulo and mexico city

      our network development services segment owns approximately 876000
       square feet and leases approximately 330000 square feet of commercial
       property in several cities around the united states these properties
       include an aggregate of approximately 472000 square feet of space at
       five locations that we use in our component part business to manufacture
       and store inventory and a 240000 square foot steel fabrication
       facility and

      the primary properties of our satellite and fiber network access
       services segment are the parcels of land on which the satellite dishes
       and related facilities of our snaps are located in the aggregate our
       snaps occupy over 310 acres of land including 304 owned acres and six
       leased acres all of these properties are located throughout the united
       states except for one in switzerland the properties that the snaps
       occupy range in size from two to one hundredacre parcels

   our interests in communications sites are comprised of a variety of fee and
leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements
and easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities in
rural areas a communications site typically consists of a threetofiveacre
tract which supports towers equipment shelters and guy wires to stabilize the
structure less than 2500 square feet are required for a monopole or
selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan
areas land leases generally have 20 to 25year terms with three fiveyear
renewals or are for fiveyear terms with automatic renewals

   pursuant to our credit facilities the lenders have liens on among other
things all towers leasehold interests tenant leases contracts relating to
the management of towers for others cash accounts receivable the stock and
other equity interests of virtually all of our subsidiaries and all
intercompany debt fixtures inventory and other personal property including
intellectual property certain fee interests and the proceeds of the foregoing

   we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to
meet our anticipated needs

item 3  legal proceedings

   as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter
ended march 31 2001 on april 23 2001 the district attorney for the county of
santa clara california filed a civil complaint against us in the superior
court of california the complaint alleged record keeping registration
hazardous materials management and filing violations under california
environmental laws the complaint did not allege any contamination of the
environment occurred as a result of the alleged violations we have taken
measures to ensure that these sites are in compliance with applicable
california environmental laws and believe that we are currently in compliance
with such laws on december 5 2001 a judgment was entered ending the lawsuit
and incorporating the terms of an agreement we negotiated previously with the
district attorneys office under the judgment we paid civil penalties of
150000 reimbursed the county for more than 25000 in costs and attorneys
fees and agreed to operate our facilities in the county in compliance with the
relevant environmental requirements in the future

   in addition we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits
that are incidental to our business we believe that no matters currently
pending would in the event of an adverse outcome have a material impact on
our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial
statements actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions this discussion should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying
notes and the information set forth under the heading critical accounting
policies on page 37

   during the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 we acquired
various communications sites service businesses and satellite and fiber
network access related businesses for aggregate purchase prices of
approximately 8272 million 18 billion and 12 billion respectively our
results of operations only reflect the acquired towers and businesses in the
periods following their respective dates of acquisition as such our results
of operations for the year ended december 31 2001 are not comparable to the
year ended december 31 2000 and the results for the year ended december 31
2000 are not comparable to the year ended december 31 1999

rental and management revenue

   rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2001 was
4446 million an increase of 1664 million from the year ended december 31
2000 the increase is primarily attributable to several factors the leasing
activity on towers acquired and constructed during 2001 the leasing activity
on towers acquired and constructed in 2000 for a full year in 2001 and an
increase in same tower revenue on towers that existed as of january 1 2000
our acquisition construction and leasing activity in 2001 has significantly
increased revenue and the scope depth and strength of our national and
international tower footprint providing us with a much larger base of tower
revenue in 2001 as compared to 2000 specifically during 2001 we acquired
more than 2400 towers and constructed more than 1300 towers additionally
during 2001 we added more than 4600 broadband equivalent tenants to both
newly acquiredconstructed and existing towers we anticipate that the majority
of our leasing activity during 2002 will continue to come from broadband type
customers

                                      24

page

   we continue to believe that leasing revenues from the rental of space on our
towers which comprises our core business are likely to grow at a more rapid
rate than revenues from our other segments because of increasing utilization of
existing tower capacity

network development services revenue

   network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2001
was 4542 million an increase of 1423 million from revenue for the year
ended december 31 2000 the significant growth in revenues during 2001
resulted primarily from increased volume related to construction management
antennae and line installation and related colocation services and tower site
maintenance the increase was also driven by a full year of revenue in 2001
related to acquisitions consummated in 2000 these acquisitions helped increase
revenue in 2001 related to component part sales and steel fabrication these
increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue related to radio
frequency engineering services

satellite and fiber network access services revenue

   satellite and fiber network access services revenue for the year ended
december 31 2001 was 2354 million an increase of 902 million from revenue
for the year ended december 31 2000 the majority of the increase resulted
from the consummation of several key acquisitions that occurred in 2001 and
2000 including general telecom us electrodynamics publicom interpacket
networks and a snap facility in switzerland these acquisitions significantly
increased our service capabilities revenue base and geographical scope of
customers leading to significant incremental revenues in 2001 this increase
in revenue was partially offset by the loss of many of its second and third
tier telecom customers and a decrease in demand for services in latin america
which we believe are attributable at least in part to the general worldwide
economic slowdown and the significant decrease in the activity of international
isps

rental and management expense

   rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2001 was
2145 million an increase of 753 million from the year ended december 31
2000 the majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses
incurred in 2001 for the more than 3700 towers that were acquired or
constructed during 2001 as discussed above the remaining increase reflects
higher operating expenses related to towers that existed as of december 31
2000 due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2001

network development services expense

   network development services expense for the year ended december 31 2001
was 4056 million an increase of 1308 million from the year ended december
31 2000 the majority of the increase is due to overall increases in the
volume of services work performed incremental expenses related to the
consummation of strategic acquisitions and increases in the overhead costs
necessary to support both internal construction and external sales

satellite and fiber network access services expense

   satellite and fiber network access services expense for the year ended
december 31 2001 was 2280 million an increase of 1179 million from the
year ended december 31 2000 the majority of the increase is due to
incremental expenses related to the consummation of the strategic acquisitions
discussed above other components of the increase include increased personnel
and infrastructure costs to help manage the growth of this segment increased
overhead related to the development and marketing of new product lines and to
a lesser extent increased bad debt expense

   during the later stages of 2001 and into 2002 our satellite and fiber
network access services segment is focusing on implementing cost reduction
measures aimed at reducing infrastructure costs consolidating

transponder space and renegotiating certain transponder agreements these
inititives are designed to improve operating margins and position verestar for
structural independence such initiatives could result in us recording a
restructuring charge in 2002 of between 50 million and 150 million

depreciation and amortization

   depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2001 was
4404 million an increase of 1570 million from the year ended december 31
2000 the principal component of the increase is an increase in depreciation
expense of 1040 million this is primarily a result of our purchase
construction and acquisition of approximately 14 billion of property and
equipment during 2001 and a full year of depreciation on aquisitions and
additions made in 2000 the other component of the increase is increased
amortization of 530 million resulting from our recording and amortizing
approximately 1841 million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to
acquisitions consummated during 2001 and a full year of amortization on
goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions made in 2000

restructuring expense

   on november 6 2001 we announced a restructuring of the organization to
include a reduction in the scope of our tower development activities and the
centralization of certain operating functions as part of that operational
initiative we are applying more selective criteria for evaluating construction
and acquisitions of towers as a result we abandoned a number of tower
construction sites resulting in a noncash charge in the fourth quarter of
2001 of approximately 626 million in addition we implemented an initiative
to consolidate operations in each of our business segments and as a
consequence incurred employee separation and office closing costs as a result
of this initiative we recorded approximately 66 million of restructuring
charges in the fourth quarter of 2001 and expect we will record approximately
30 million of additional restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2002 no
similar charges were incurred in 2000

development expense

   development expense for the year ended december 31 2001 was 86 million a
decrease of 59 million from the year ended december 31 2000 this decrease
resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to tower site inspections
data gathering and acquisition integration in 2001

corporate general and administrative expense

   corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31
2001 was 265 million an increase of 115 million from the year ended
december 31 2000 the majority of the increase is a result of increased
personnel and information technology costs to support our overall growth
coupled with expenses incurred to implement a new companywide enterprise
resource planning erp system

interest expense

   interest expense for the year ended december 31 2001 was 2823 million an
increase of 1255 million from the year ended december 31 2000 the majority
of the increase 1130 million resulted primarily from increased borrowings
outstanding under our credit facilities and the issue of 10 billion of senior
notes in january 2001 offset by a decrease in interest rates under our credit
facilities the remaining component of the increase represents increases in
interest on capital leases and other notes payable and incremental deferred
financing amortization

interest income and other net

   interest income and other net for the year ended december 31 2001 was
267 million an increase of 112 million from the year ended december 31
2000 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on
invested cash on hand resulting principally from the sale of our senior notes
in january 2001 partially offset by losses on the fair value of certain
derivative instruments

interest incometv azteca net

   interest incometv azteca net for the year ended december 31 2001 was
144 million an increase of 17 million from the year ended december 31
2000 the increase resulted from interest earned on the entire principal amount
of the note 1198 million during 2001 as compared to 2000 when less than the
entire principal amount of the note was outstanding for the year

loss on investments

   loss on investments for the year ended december 31 2001 was 406 million
an increase of 380 million from the year ended december 31 2000 the
increase resulted primarily from the write off of our investment in us wireless
of 234 million coupled with additional investment impairment losses of 82
million and losses on equity investments of 90 million

note conversion expense

   during the year ended december 31 2001 we acquired a portion of our 225
convertible notes in exchange for shares of our class a common stock as a
consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders we
recorded a noncash charge of 263 million in similar transactions during the
year ended december 31 2000 we acquired a portion of our 625 and 225
convertible notes in exchange for shares of our class a common stock as a
result we recorded a noncash charge of 170 million during that year these
charges represent the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to
encourage them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled
redemption date

benefit for income taxes

   the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2001 was 1168
million an increase of 571 million from the year ended december 31 2000
the primary reason for the increase is a result of an increase in our loss
before income taxes and extraordinary losses partially offset by an increase
in amortization of nondeductible intangible assets arising from stock
acquisitions nondeductible note conversion expense and the valuation
allowance primarily related to our state net operating loss carryforwards the
effective tax rate differs in both periods from the statutory rate due to state
and international taxes the valuation allowance and the effect of
nondeductible items principally the amortization of goodwill on certain stock
acquisitions and nondeductible note conversion expense

   financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 109 accounting
for income taxes requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized at december 31 2001 we provided a valuation allowance
primarily related to our state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately 563 million we have not provided a valuation allowance for the
remaining deferred tax assets primarily our federal net operating loss
carryforwards as management believes that we will have sufficient time to
realize these assets during the carryforward period

extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt net

   we incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt net in 2000
of 43 million the losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and
restatement of our primary credit facilities 30 million net of a tax
benefit of 20 million and our early retirement of debt assumed in the
unisite inc merger 13 million net of a tax benefit of 09 million no
comparable losses were recorded in 2001

rental and management revenue

   rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2000 was
2782 million an increase of 1429 million from the year ended december 31
1999 the increase is primarily attributable to two factors the acquisition
and construction of towers in 2000 and the latter part of 1999 and increased
leaseups utilization of new and existing towers during 2000 we continued
to implement our growth strategy by aggressively acquiring and building new
towers with the consummation of the airtouch att and other transactions we
acquired more than 4600 towers in 2000 this coupled with the construction of
over 1600 towers in 2000 increased the scope depth and strength of our
national and international tower footprint providing us with a much larger base
of towers generating revenue in 2000 as compared to 1999

   during 2000 we also focused on implementing an area management structure
that enhances sales and marketing enabling us to increase the utilization of
both previously existing prior to january 2000 and newly acquiredconstructed
towers increased utilization resulted in increases in revenue in 2000 for
towers that were in our portfolio as of january 1 2000

network development services revenue

   network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2000
was 3119 million an increase of 2215 million from revenue for the year
ended december 31 1999 the significant growth in revenues during 2000
resulted from strategic acquisitions and increased demand for installation work
and component parts from major wireless carriers

   during 2000 we acquired several key services companies that added
additional revenue and expanded our inhouse services capabilities among the
acquisitions were galaxy engineering services which enables us to perform an
array of radio frequency engineering and network design services such as drive
testing voice quality analysis and transport engineering and kline iron 
steel co a steel fabrication company with expertise in broadcast towers in
addition increased demand for some of our network development services such
as equipment installation maintenance and sales of component parts also
created additional revenue in 2000 much of this increased demand was a result
of aggressive network expansion programs initiated by major wireless
communications carriers during the year in contrast our revenues from site
acquisition and construction work for others which are also part of our
network development services segment have declined this decline is
attributable to the trend in the wireless communications industry to outsource
tower infrastructure needs this trend means we are increasingly applying our
site acquisition and construction capabilities to our buildtosuit projects
and for other construction for our own account

satellite and fiber network access services revenue

   satellite and fiber network access services revenue for the year ended
december 31 2000 was 1452 million an increase of 1128 million from
revenue for the year ended december 31 1999 the majority of the increase can
be attributed to the consummation of several key acquisitions that occurred in
2000 and the fourth quarter of 1999 including icg satellite services general
telecom us electrodynamics and publicom these acquisitions significantly
increased our service capabilities revenue base and geographical scope of our
customers as well as providing significant incremental revenues in 2000 we
also experienced an increase in demand of the internet and data requirements of
our internet service provider customers in 2000

rental and management expense

   rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was
1392 million an increase of 768 million from the year ended december 31
1999 a significant portion of the increase is attributable to incremental
operating expenses incurred in 2000 for towers that were acquired or
constructed during 2000 and the latter part of 1999 as discussed above the
remaining component of the increase is primarily related to additional expenses
incurred by us in 2000 to implement our area management structure together
with to a lesser extent increases in operating expenses on towers that
existed prior to january 1 2000

network development services expense

   network development services expense for the year ended december 31 2000
was 2748 million an increase of 2055 million from the year ended december
31 1999 the significant increase in expense is primarily due to the strategic
acquisitions consummated in 2000 as discussed above in addition we incurred
expenses in 2000 to transition a portion of our construction services unit from
tower construction work to equipment installation and other services this
transition was related in part to an ongoing process to decentralize some of
our tower construction capabilities and develop some of those capabilities at
our regional and area locations remaining increases in expense are directly
related to a charge for a bad debt reserve of approximately 70 million
recorded in the fourth quarter and overall increases in the amount of services
and component sales to customers

satellite and fiber network access services expense

   satellite and fiber network access services expense for the year ended
december 31 2000 was 1101 million an increase of 860 million from the
year ended december 31 1999 substantially all of the increase can be
attributed to the strategic acquisitions discussed above together with
additional expenses related to integrating those acquisitions remaining
increases are related to the building of infrastructure to help manage the
growth of this segment and overall increases in volume

depreciation and amortization

   depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2000 was
2834 million an increase of 1508 million from the year ended december 31
1999 one component of the increase is attributable to an increase in
depreciation expense of 748 million this is a direct result of our purchase
construction and acquisition of approximately 13 billion of property and
equipment during 2000 and a full year of depreciation on acquisitions and
additions made in 1999 the remaining component of the increase is an increase
in amortization of 760 million resulting from our recording and amortizing
approximately 13 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets related to
acquisitions consummated during 2000 and a full year of amortizaton on
goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions made in 1999

development expense

   development expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was 145 million
an increase of 129 million from the year ended december 31 1999 the
majority of the increase represents costs related to tower site inspections
related data gathering and certain integration expenses related to acquisitions
consummated in 2000 the remaining component of the increase represents
expenses incurred in connection with abandoned acquisitions and other
acquisition related costs which are not capitalized in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles

corporate general and administrative expense

   corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31
2000 was 150 million an increase of 58 million from the year ended
december 31 1999 the majority of the increase is a result of higher
personnel marketing professional services and information technology costs
associated with supporting our increasing number of towers the growth of our
other businesses our expanding revenue base and our growth strategy

interest expense

   interest expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was 1568 million an
increase of 1293 million from the year ended december 31 1999 this increase
is primarily related to increased borrowings to finance acquisitions and
construction the net change specifically is attributable to increases in
interest incurred on our outstanding debt obligations of 1317 million and
deferred financing amortization of 56 million these interest increases were
offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to construction projects
of 80 million

interest income and other net

   interest income and other net for the year ended december 31 2000 was
156 million a decrease of 19 million from the year ended december 31
1999 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest earned
on invested cash on hand as a consequence of such cash being used to finance
acquisitions and construction

   interest incometv azteca net for the year ended december 31 2000 was
127 million an increase of 108 million for the year ended december 31
1999 amounts included within this caption at december 31 2000 represent
interest earned on our note receivable from tv azteca of 137 million offset
by interest expense of 10 million

loss gain on investments

   loss on investments for the year ended december 31 2000 was 25 million
an increase of 28 million from the year ended december 31 1999 the increase
resulted primarily from losses on equity investments made in 2000

note conversion expense

   during the year ended december 31 2000 we acquired a portion of our 625
and 225 convertible notes in exchange for shares of our class a common stock
as a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders
we recorded an expense of approximately 170 million during the second quarter
of 2000 which represents the fair value of incremental stock issued to
noteholders to encourage them to convert their holdings prior to the first
scheduled redemption date

benefit provision for income taxes

   the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2000 was 597
million an increase of 599 million from the year ended december 31 1999
the primary reason for the increase is a result of an increase in our loss
before income taxes and extraordinary losses partially offset by an increase
in amortization of nondeductible intangible assets arising from stock
acquisitions nondeductible note conversion expense and the valuation
allowance primarily related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards
the effective tax rate differs in both periods from the statutory rate due to
the effect of nondeductible items principally the amortization of goodwill on
certain stock acquisitions and for the year ended december 31 2000 the
nondeductible note conversion expense on which we have recorded no tax benefit

   fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes requires that we record
a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at december 31 2001 we
provided a valuation allowance of approximately 60 million we have not
provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily
our federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we
will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the twentyyear
carryforward period

extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt net

   we incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2000 of
43 million the losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and
restatement of our primary credit facilities 30 million net of a tax
benefit of 20 million and our early retirement of debt assumed in the
unisite inc merger 13 million net of a tax benefit of 09 million

liquidity and capital resources

  overview

   we plan to fund our current business plan with cash generated from our
operations and by borrowing under our credit facilities historically we have
met our operational liquidity needs and interest expense related to our debt
obligations primarily with internally generated funds we have financed our
tower acquisitions and construction activities with a combination of capital
funds from sales of our equity and debt securities and bank borrowings

                                      31

page

   in the latter half of 2001 major wireless carriers reduced their planned
capital expenditures for geographic network expansion we expect that wireless
carriers will make capital expenditures in 2002 primarily to increase the
density of their current network coverage and improve the quality of service to
existing subscribers while selectively investing to expand network coverage
during the later part of the year we began to reduce our tower construction
program and in november 2001 we announced new operational initiatives to
reduce significantly our tower development activities and to consolidate
operations in each of our business segments

   we expect that during 2003 we will become free cash flow positive meaning
that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our operational needs
interest expense and capital expenditures we believe we will have sufficient
liquidity and capital resources from our operating cash flows and borrowings
under our credit facilities to support our business plan until that occurs

  uses of liquidity

   our uses of liquidity include operational needs capital expenditures for
tower construction and acquisitions and debt service

   tower construction and acquisition needs we have significantly reduced our
planned level of tower construction and acquisitions for 2002 as a result we
anticipate that our liquidity needs for new tower development and acquisitions
in 2002 will be significantly less than in previous years

       tower construction our 2002 capital budget provides for total capital
        expenditures of approximately 2000 million to 2250 million which
        includes towers to be built under existing buildtosuit agreements in
        contrast we spent 5680 million on total capital expenditures in
        2001 we plan to build in 2002 between 400 and 500 towers including
        nine broadcast towers in contrast we built approximately 1300
        towers including five broadcast towers in 2001

       tower acquisitions as of december 31 2001 we were committed to make
        capital expenditures of approximately 300 million for pending
        acquisitions including 84 million for alltel which we closed in
        january and february 2002 we spent approximately 8096 million in
        cash in 2001 for acquisitions

   debt service we use a significant portion of our liquidity to service our
outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2001 we had outstanding total
longterm debt of about 36 billion consisting primarily of the following

       our credit facilities145 billion

       our senior notes10 billion and

       our convertible notes net of discount8669 million

   our credit facilities senior notes and convertible notes require us to make
significant principal payments at their respective maturity dates in addition
in the case of our credit facilities we must make scheduled amortization
payments of principal prior to maturity beginning march 31 2003 our credit
facilities require amortization of the term loans in increasing annual amounts
designed to repay the loans by maturity interest on our senior notes is
payable semiannually on february 1 and august 1 under our credit facilities
we are required to maintain an interest reserve for our senior notes through
the august 2002 interest payment these funds can only be used to make
scheduled interest payments on those notes as of december 31 2001 we had
approximately 941 million of restricted cash related to that interest
reserve interest on our convertible notes is payable semiannually prior to
maturity there are no mandatory redemption provisions for cash in the senior
notes or the convertible notes the holders of the convertible notes however
have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior
to maturity but we may pay the repurchase price by issuing shares of our class
a common stock for a more complete description of our outstanding
indebtedness see contractual commitments below and note 6 to our
consolidated financial statements

                                      32

  sources of liquidity

   our primary sources of liquidity historically have been internally generated
funds from operations borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from
equity and debt offerings and cash on hand

   internally generated funds  our operating revenues divisional cash flow
and ebitda for the year ended december 31 2001 were 11 billion 3005
million and 2740 million respectively our tower leasing activities generate
the highest profit margins we believe those activities are likely to grow more
rapidly than our other segments because of increased utilization of our
existing towers

   credit facilities as of december 31 2001 we had not drawn on the 6500
million revolving line of credit under our credit facilities as of december
31 2001 based on financial covenants and giving effect to the repayment of
our mexican credit facility described below we had the ability to draw 5550
million on this revolving line of credit because of existing cash on hand our
anticipated borrowing needs and the unused capacity in our credit facilities
in january 2002 we chose to cancel our incremental 2500 million term c loan
as a result our maximum borrowing capacity under the credit facilities was
reduced from 225 billion to 20 billion

   proceeds from equity and debt offerings historically we have been
successful at raising funds in the capital markets through equity and debt
offerings we have used these proceeds mostly to fund new tower development and
acquisitions for example in january 2001 we completed a public offering of
100 million shares of our class a common stock for total net proceeds of
approximately 3608 million we also completed in that month a private
placement of 10 billion of our senior notes for total net proceeds of 9690
million

   cash on hand as of december 31 2001 we had approximately 1300 million
in cash and cash equivalents approximately 941 million is restricted under
our credit facilities and can only be used to make scheduled interest payments
on the senior notes as of december 31 2001 we had approximately 1795
million of working capital

  plans to fund our liquidity needs

   we plan to fund our operational liquidity needs through internally generated
funds from operations we plan to fund our capital expenditures for new tower
construction and acquisitions and our interest expense through a combination of
internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities we
anticipate aggregate incremental borrowing needs for 2002 and 2003 of under
2000 million during 2003 we expect that our operating cash flows will
become sufficient to fund both our capital expenditures for new tower
construction and acquisitions and the interest expense on our outstanding debt

   we may in the future need to raise cash from external sources to meet our
debt service obligations and to pay the principal amounts of our indebtedness
when due

  contractual commitments

   below is a summary of our credit facilities senior notes convertible notes
and certain other contractual obligations it is qualified in its entirety by
the terms of the actual agreements which are summarized also see note 6 and
note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for more information about the
terms of our indebtedness and our commitments and contingencies

   credit facilities our credit facilities provide us with a borrowing
capacity of up to 20 billion with the option subject to lender approval to
increase the capacity up to an additional 5000 million our principal
operating subsidiaries are the borrowers under our credit facilities
borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to compliance with certain
financial ratios as described below our credit facilities currently include

                                      33

page

       a 6500 million revolving credit facility which was fully available
        subject to compliance with those financial ratios on december 31
        2001 maturing on june 30 2007

       an 8500 million multidraw term loan a which was fully drawn on
        december 31 2001 maturing on june 30 2007 and

       a 5000 million term loan b which was fully drawn on december 31
        2001 maturing on december 31 2007

   the credit facilities are scheduled to amortize quarterly commencing in
march 2003 in january 2002 we terminated a 2500 million multidraw term
loan c facility none of which facility had been drawn as a result of this
termination we will record a noncash charge of 75 million to other
expense in the first quarter of 2002 related to the writeoff of certain
deferred financing fees we believe the 6500 million revolving credit
facility remaining under the 20 billion of credit facilities will be
sufficient to finance our business plan

   our credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operational
covenants and other restrictions with which the borrower subsidiaries and the
restricted subsidiaries must comply any failure to comply with these covenants
would not only prevent us from being able to borrow more funds but would also
constitute a default for more information about these covenants see factors
affecting sources of liquidity  credit facilities they also restrict our
ability as the parent company of the borrower subsidiaries to incur any debt
other than that presently outstanding and refinancings of that debt we and our
restricted subsidiaries have guaranteed all of the loans we have secured the
loans by liens on substantially all assets of the borrower subsidiaries and the
restricted subsidiaries and substantially all outstanding capital stock and
other debt and equity interests of all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries

reserve for our senior notes through the august 2002 interest payment these
funds can only be used to make scheduled interest payments on those notes as
of december 31 2001 we had approximately 941 million of restricted cash
related to that interest reserve

consummated a loan agreement with a group of banks providing a credit facility
of an initial aggregate amount of 950 million as of december 31 2001 an
aggregate of 950 million was outstanding under this loan agreement in
february 2002 we repaid all of the loans with borrowings under our credit
facilities and our mexican subsidiaries became restricted subsidiaries under
our credit facilities as a result of such repayment we will recognize an
extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2002 of
approximately 13 million net of an income tax benefit of 07 million

   9  38 senior notes as of december 31 2001 we had outstanding an
aggregate principal amount of 10 billion of 9 38  senior notes the senior
notes mature on february 1 2009 interest on the senior notes is payable
semiannually on february 1 and august 1 the indenture governing the senior
notes contains certain restrictive covenants including restrictions on our
ability to incur more debt guarantee debt pay dividends and make certain
investments for more information about these covenants see factors affecting
sources of liquidity  senior notes

notes due 2009 in an aggregate principal amount of 3000 million and 225
convertible notes due 2009 at an issue price of 3001 million representing
7052 of their principal amount at maturity of 4255 million the difference
between the issue price and the principal amount at maturity of the 225

   in addition as of december 31 2001 we were party to various arrangements
relating to the construction of tower sites under existing buildtosuit
agreements we expect that for the foreseeable future we will have substantial
leverage from our bank borrowings other debt and capitalized leases

  factors affecting sources of liquidity

   internally generated funds  the key factors affecting our internally
generated funds are the demand for antennae space on wireless communication
towers and for related services our ability to maximize the utilization of our
existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully realize our
operating efficiencies

   credit facilities  our credit facilities contain borrowing ratio covenants
that limit our ability to borrow funds our credit facilities contain four
financial tests

       a leverage ratio total debt to annualized operating cash flow as of
        december 31 2001 we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater
        than 775 to 100 decreasing to 750 to 100 on january 1 2002 to
        700 to 100 on april 1 2002 to 675 to 100 on july 1 2002 to 650
        to 100 at october 1 2002 and with additional reductions every six
        months thereafter

       a pro forma debt service test annualized operating cash flow to pro
        forma debt service requires us to maintain a ratio of not greater than
        110 to 100

       an interest coverage test annualized operating cash flow to interest
        expense as of december 31 2001 we were required to maintain a ratio
        of not less than 150 to 100 through june 30 2002 increasing by 025
        on july 1 2002 and october 1 2002 and by 050 on january 1 2003 and
        january 1 2004 and

       a fixed charge coverage test annualized operating cash flow to fixed
        charges which begins in 2003 and requires us to maintain a ratio of
        not less than 10 to 10

   since our credit facilities are with certain of our subsidiaries our parent
company debt the senior notes and the convertible notes is not included in
the computations of any of the tests except in the case of the pro forma debt
service test in which case interest includes the amount of funds that we will
require to be distributed by our subsidiaries to pay interest on our senior
notes and our convertible notes annualized operating cash flow is based among
other things on four times the operating cash flow for the most recent quarter
of our tower rental and management business and trailing 12 months for our
other businesses and corporate general and administrative expenses in the case
of the leverage ratio we may include the operating cash flow from brazil and
mexico only to the extent of 10 of annualized operating cash flow and we
receive credit for only 75 of annualized operating cash flow from our services
and verestar businesses

                                      36

   as of december 31 2001 we were in compliance with these borrowing ratio
covenants

   senior notes our senior note indenture restricts us from incurring
additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our
consolidated debt is not greater than 75 times our adjusted consolidated cash
flow however we are permitted even if we are not in compliance with the
ratio to incur debt under our credit facilities or renewals refundings
replacements or refinancings of them up to the greater of 265 billion or a
formula based on the number of towers we own and our nontower cash flow even
if not in compliance with the ratio we are also permitted to among other
things have certain types of capital leases and to refund our convertible
notes for these purposes consolidated debt means all debt including
guarantees of our parent company and all of our restricted subsidiaries which
presently include all of them other than verestar and its subsidiaries and
the aggregate liquidation value of disqualified stock disqualified stock means
capital stock maturing mandatorily redeemable or redeemable at the holders
option prior to 91 days after the maturity of the senior notes adjusted
consolidated cash flow is substantially similar to the definition of annualized
operating cash flow as defined in the credit facilities except it applies to
our parent company and our restricted subsidiaries

   capital markets our ability to raise additional funds in the capital
markets depends on among other things general economic conditions the
condition of the wireless industry our financial performance and the state of
the capital markets

  cash flows summary

   for the year ended december 31 2001 cash flows provided by operating
activities were 261 million as compared to 371 million used for operating
activities for the year ended december 31 2000 this change is primarily
related to an overall reduction in our investment in working capital

   for the year ended december 31 2001 cash flows used for investing
activities were 14 billion as compared to 20 billion for the year ended
december 31 2000 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash expended
for mergers and acquisitions

   for the year ended december 31 2001 cash flows provided by financing
activities were 14 billion as compared to 21 billion for the year ended
december 31 2000 the decrease is primarily related to a reduction in the
aggregate net cash inflows from bank borrowings and equity offerings offset by
an increase in proceeds from the issue of debt securities

critical accounting policies

   in december 2001 the sec requested that all registrants disclose their most
critical accounting policies in managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations the sec indicated that a
critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of
the companys financial condition and results and requires managements most
difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to
make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain
further critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of
significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially
different results under different assumptions and conditions

   we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition
of critical accounting policies

      revenue recognition  a portion of our network development services
       revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that
       provide for billings on a fixed price basis revenues under these
       contracts are recognized using the percentageofcompletion methodology
       under the percentageofcompletion methodology revenues are recognized
       in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date
       compared to the estimated total contract costs due to uncertainties and
       estimates inherent within percentageofcompletion accounting it is
       possible that estimates will be

                                      37

page

       revised as project work progresses changes to total estimated contract
       costs or losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are
       determined

      income taxes  the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its
       net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more
       likely than not to be realized at december 31 2001 we provided a
       valuation allowance primarily related to our state operating loss
       carryforwards of approximately 563 million we have not provided a
       valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets primarily our
       federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we
       will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the
       carryforward period

       the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends on our
       ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future based on
       our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward
       period we believe our net deferred tax asset will be realized if we
       are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will
       be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to
       income tax expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in
       stockholders equity

      impairment of assets  we review longlived assets including
       intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
       indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we
       assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the
       related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash
       flows if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be
       recoverable we will measure any impairment based on the projected
       future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared
       to its carrying value we record any related impairment losses in the
       period in which we identify such impairment

       during the year ended december 31 2001 we recorded impairment charges
       relating to our longlived assets of approximately 116 million those
       charges are reflected in depreciation and amortization in our 2001
       consolidated statement of operations

      investment impairment charges  investments in those entities where we
       own less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual
       entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and
       financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost
       method investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent
       but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
       and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty
       percent of the voting stock of the individual entity but not in excess
       of fifty percent are accounted for using the equity method as of
       december 31 2001 all of our investments were in companies that are not
       publicly traded and therefore no established market for their
       securities exists we have a policy in place to review the fair value of
       our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the
       investments in these companies if we believe that the carrying value of
       an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value it is our
       policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to
       the market value

                                      38

page

       during the year ended december 31 2001 we recorded impairment charges
       on our investments of 316 million these charges are reflected in loss
       gain on investments in our consolidated statement of operations

   the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our
accounting policies see our audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto which begin on page f1 of this annual report where our
significant accounting policies are discussed

recent accounting pronouncements

   on january 1 2001 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial
accounting standard sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities as amended our 2001 consolidated financial statements
were prepared in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 133 the 2000 and
1999 consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the
applicable literature for derivatives and hedging instruments in effect at that
time the cumulative effect of adopting this statement resulted in a charge to
other comprehensive loss of 79 million net of a tax benefit of 42 million

   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas
no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 141 supersedes
accounting principles board apb opinion no 16 business combinations and
sfas no 38 accounting for preacquisition contingencies and eliminates
poolingofinterest accounting for business combinations sfas no 141 also
includes enhanced criteria for identifying intangible assets separately from
goodwill the requirements of sfas no 141 were effective for any business
combination consummated by us subsequent to june 30 2001 we did not
consummate any acquisitions subsequent to june 30 2001 that gave rise to
goodwill

   sfas no 142 supersedes apb opinion no 17 intangible assets and
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no
longer be amortized but reviewed for impairment at least annually intangible
assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives

   the adoption of sfas no 142 is expected to reduce our annual amortization
of goodwill by approximately 900 million we are in the process of assessing
the transitional impairment test and the related valuation of goodwill under
sfas no 142 for our company however upon completion of the transitional
impairment test it is likely we will record a noncash impairment charge in
our statement of operations related to verestar although the amount of the
charge has not been determined goodwill related to verestar was approximately
1850 million as of december 31 2001 we will reflect this charge if
necessary as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our
2002 statement of operations

   in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment
or disposal of longlived assets this statement supersedes sfas no 121
accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets
to be disposed of the statement retains the previously existing accounting
requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of
longlived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement
requirements of longlived assets to be disposed of by sale to include
discontinued operations it also expands the previously existing reporting
requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity
that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale we
implemented sfas no 144 on january 1 2002 the adoption of this statement was
not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

   we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on longterm
debt obligations we attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative
financial instruments namely interest rate caps swaps and collars pursuant
to our policies all derivative financial instruments are for purposes other
than trading for the year ended december 31 2001 we increased our borrowings
under our credit facilities by approximately 950 million in addition we
completed a private placement of 10 billion of our senior notes issued at
100 of their face amount the proceeds from the above were used to finance
capital expenditures and acquisitions in the shortterm we invested any
unused proceeds in marketable debt securities commercial paper and cash and
cash equivalents in june 2001 we entered into an interest rate collar
agreement with a total notional amount of 475 million expiring in june 2003
in august 2001 we acquired an aggregate of 825 million face amount 616
million carrying amount of our 225 convertible notes for shares of our class
a common stock lastly in november 2001 we terminated an interest rate collar
agreement with a total notional amount of 1850 million originally expiring in
may 2002 and simultaneously entered into an interest rate swap agreement with
a total notional amount of 1850 million expiring in november 2003

   the following tables provide information as of december 31 2001 and 2000

   we maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in shortterm
financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks due to the
relatively short duration of such instruments we believe fluctuations in
interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our
financial condition or results of operations

   our foreign operations in 2001 and 2000 were not significant accordingly
foreign currency risk has not been material for the years ended december 31

longlived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement
requirements of longlived assets to be disposed of by sale to include
discontinued operations it also expands the previously existing reporting
requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity

not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial position or

basis stepup from corporate restructuring represents the tax effects of
increasing the basis for tax purposes of certain of the companys assets in
conjunction with its spinoff from american radio

at december 31 2001 the company had net federal and state operating loss
carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income of 8160 million for
federal purposes these loss carryforwards if not utilized expire between
2008 and 2021 for state purposes carryforwards expire on varying dates from
2003 to 2021

sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes requires that companies record a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at december 31 2001 the
company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately 563 million
primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards the company has
not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining net deferred tax assets
primarily its federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes
the company will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the
twentyyear carryforward period

the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets depends on the
companys ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future based on
its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period
management believes that its net deferred tax asset will be realized if the
company is unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future it will
be required to reduce its net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax
expense which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity

accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the purchase prices have
been allocated to the net assets acquired principally tangible and intangible
assets and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition the company has recorded the excess of purchase price over
the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill and other
intangible assets for certain acquisitions the consolidated financial
statements reflect preliminary allocations of purchase price as appraisals of
the net assets acquired have not been finalized the company does not expect
any changes in depreciation and amortization from the finalization of these
appraisals to be material to its consolidated results of operations

primarily acquired its tower assets from third parties in one of three ways

property and equipment for the appraised value of the tower replacement cost
intangible assets for existing customer base and any other identifiable
intangibles if applicable any remaining purchase price is then recorded
within intangible assets as a networklocation intangible

allocation is similar to the above except that the remaining purchase price
after valuing all assets including towers and identifiable intangibles and
liabilities is recorded in accordance with apb no 16 business combinations

item 1 business

overview

  we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure
company operating in three business segments

    rental and management our primary business is renting antenna space to
     wireless and broadcast companies on multitenant communications towers
     we operate the largest network of wireless communications towers in
     north america and are the largest independent operator of broadcast
     towers in north america based on number of towers our growth strategy
     focuses on both the acquisition and construction of towers we use our
     own extensive tower network development capabilities which include site
     acquisition and tower construction services to construct our own build
     tosuit and other towers these capabilities enable us to construct
     towers at costs that are generally lower than the cost of acquiring
     towers

    network development services through atc integrated services we
     provide the fullrange of towerrelated services necessary to establish
     develop and maintain wireless and broadcast tower networks theses
     services include

        radio frequency engineering consulting
        site acquisition and network design
        zoning and other governmental approvals
        tower construction
        antenna installation
        tower component part sales and
        site monitoring and maintenance

    we provide these services to a variety of customers and actively market
    them as part of a turnkey solution to our existing and prospective
    rental customers we believe our full service capabilities enhance our
    core rental and management business by

        making us a more attractive choice for buildtosuit
         opportunities
        enabling us to construct towers at costs that are generally less
         than the costs of acquiring towers this costefficiency enables
         us to reduce our weighted average cost per tower thereby
         improving the overall return of our rental and management
         business
        strengthening our customer relationships and
        increasing recurring revenues and cash flow from our towers

    satellite and fiber network access services our verestar subsidiary is
     a leading provider of integrated satellite and fiber network access
     services based on the number of our teleport antennae and facilities
     we provide these services to telecommunications companies internet
     service providers isps broadcasters and maritime customers both
     domestic and international verestars teleports and other facilities
     enable its customers to transmit internet traffic voice video and
     other data through the integration of satellites highspeed fiber
     connections and communications switches

  our operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2000 were 7353
million our three business segments accounted for the following percentages

  the relative contributions of each of our segments to our total operating
revenues in 2000 may not be indicative of future periods for more financial
information about our business segments and geographic information about our
operating revenues and longlived assets see managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 13 to our
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

  we have a diversified base of customers for the year ended december 31
2000 none of our customers accounted for more than 10 of our operating
revenues and our five largest customers accounted for approximately 23 of
those revenues our customer base includes customers from various sectors
within the wireless communications industry including personal communication
services cellular and paging

growth strategy

  background our growth strategy is to capitalize on the rapid expansion
taking place in the wireless communications industry we believe the increase
in demand for wireless communications is attributable to a number of factors
including

    technological advances in communications equipment
    decreasing costs of wireless services
    the development of new applications for wireless services
    the increasing mobility of the us population
    the growing awareness of the benefits of mobile communications
    the auctioning of new communications spectrum and
    business and consumer preferences for higher quality wireless internet
     voice and data transmission

  we believe that as the wireless communications industry grows and becomes
more competitive many carriers seek to preserve capital and speed access to
their markets by

    focusing on activities that contribute directly to subscriber growth
    outsourcing infrastructure requirements such as owning constructing and
     maintaining towers and
    colocating transmission facilities which is likely to accelerate
     because of environmental and other regulatory restrictions resulting in
     the growing tendency of local authorities to slow the proliferation of
     towers in their communities

  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from these trends in wireless
communications and to play an increasing role in addressing the needs of the
wireless broadcast and internet infrastructure industries our belief is
based on the following reasons

    we operate the largest network of wireless communications towers in
     north america and are the largest independent operator of broadcast
     towers in north america based on number of towers we believe that
     national and other large wireless service providers prefer to deal with
     a company such as ours that can meet the majority of their tower needs
     within a particular market or region in addition we offer turnkey
     solutions to our customers including a broad range of network
     development services and related components and equipment
    we are both an experienced builder and acquirer of towers providing us
     the flexibility to choose the most costeffective means to expand our
     network of towers
    we are involved in a number of buildtosuit projects which generally
     reduce the financial risk of building new towers because these projects
     have anchor tenants which are often located in markets where we would
     like to expand our existing operations or in new markets where we would
     like to establish a presence
    through our verestar subsidiary we are addressing the expanding market
     for satellite and fiber network access services

                                       2

    we have a strong and experienced management team led by our chairman
     and chief executive officer steven b dodge

  we are seeking to enhance our position as a leader in each of our business
segments by

    expanding our leading national footprint of desirable communications
     towers in most major markets in the united states creating networks in
     mexico and canada and creating networks internationally to serve
     attractive foreign markets that we do not currently serve
    increasing the profitability of our tower operations by reducing average
     cost per tower through construction and attractive acquisitions
     reducing tower operating expenses and actively marketing unused space on
     our towers
    serving profitably selected infrastructure needs of our customers and
    expanding verestar as a leading provider of satellite and fiber network
     access services for telecommunications companies isps broadcasters and
     maritime customers

  internal growth through sales service and capacity utilization we believe
that a substantial opportunity for profitable growth exists by increasing the
utilization of our existing towers and towers that we may build or acquire in
the future because the costs of operating a site are largely fixed
increasing tower utilization significantly improves site operating margins
many of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antenna
space rental that we believe can be utilized at low incremental cost

  we intend to continue to use targeted sales and marketing techniques to
increase utilization of our towers we believe that the key to the success of
this strategy lies in our ability to develop and consistently deliver a high
level of customer service and to be widely recognized as a company that makes
realistic commitments and then delivers on them since speed to market and
reliable network performance are critical components to the success of
wireless service providers our ability to assist our customers in meeting
these goals will ultimately define our marketing success and capacity
utilization we target as customers wireless service providers that are
expanding or improving their existing network infrastructure as well as those
deploying new technologies

  we also intend to continue actively marketing and selling our network
development services and satellite and fiber network access services as
related sources of revenue from those earned through our rental and management
business we expect that a significant part of our growth may consist of
selling services and components to new customers on our existing towers or
towers that we may construct on a buildtosuit or other basis

  growth by buildtosuitconstruction we believe we can achieve attractive
investment returns for our company by constructing new tower clusters

    in and around markets in which we already have a presence
    along major highways and
    in targeted new markets particularly markets that have not been
     significantly built out by carriers or other communications site
     companies

  we often seek to work with one or more anchor tenants when we construct
towers when we do so we develop an overall master plan for a particular
network by locating new sites in areas identified by our customers as optimal
for their network expansion requirements we generally secure commitments for
leasing from the customer prior to commencing construction thereby reducing
the risks associated with the investment

  in some cases however we may invest in the zoning and permitting of sites
and even the construction of tower buildouts where we have no anchor tenant
we do this when based on radio frequency engineering studies our market
knowledge and our awareness of our customers buildout plans we believe
demand will exist in the near term

                                       3

  we intend to place a strong emphasis on new tower development for the
foreseeable future because we believe that this can produce relatively
attractive initial returns in addition we can design and build towers to
specifications that assure ample future capacity and minimize the need for
future capital expenditures we also intend to pursue new tower construction to
service the demand for digital television and for tower space for radio
antennae displaced by digital television requirements

  growth by acquisitions we have achieved a leading industry position through
acquisitions and construction we intend to continue to pursue strategic
mergers and acquisitions with independent tower operators consolidators and
wireless service providers our acquisition strategy is designed to

    achieve enhanced operating efficiencies
    take advantage of divestiture opportunities presented by wireless
     service providers
    broaden and strengthen our penetration of major markets
    facilitate entry into new geographic markets in the united states and
     abroad and
    complement our construction program

  among the potential acquisitions are tower networks still owned by major
wireless service providers we have entered into these types of transactions
with alltel airtouch and att as described elsewhere in this report these
transactions are usually substantial involving several thousand towers and
purchase prices in the hundreds of millions of dollars in addition they often
entail buildtosuit contracts involving thousands of towers

  we also intend to pursue on a selective basis the acquisition of companies
to enhance our satellite and fiber network access business

products and services

  we offer our products and services through three business segments

    rental and management
    network development services and
    satellite and fiber network access services provided by verestar

 rental and management segment

  leasing of antennae sites our primary business is renting antenna space to
wireless and broadcast companies on multitenant communications towers we
operate the largest network of wireless communications towers in north america
and are the largest independent operator of broadcast towers in north america
based on number of towers assuming the consummation of our pending
transactions we operate a tower network of approximately 13600 multiuser
sites in the united states canada and mexico including more than 300
broadcast tower sites approximately 12600 of these towers are owned or leased
sites and approximately 1000 are managed sites or leasesublease sites under
which we hold a position as lessee that is coterminous with a related
sublease our networks in the united states canada and mexico are national in
scope our us network spans 49 states and the district of columbia with
tower clusters in 43 of the 50 largest us metropolitan statistical areas our
developing mexican network includes sites in highly populated areas including
mexico city monterrey guadalajara and acapulco we plan for our canadian
operations to include sites in major metropolitan areas

  we lease antenna space on our towers to tenants in a diverse range of
wireless communications and broadcast industries wireless industries we serve
include personal communications services cellular enhanced specialized
mobile radio specialized mobile radio paging fixed microwave and fixed

    verizon                                          western wireless

  most major radio and television broadcasters rent antenna space on our
broadcast towers including

    abc                      cbs                     clear channel
    cox                      fox                     infinity
    nbc                      paxson                  paramount
    sinclair                 telemedia               tribune
    tv azteca                univision

  lease terms our leases like most of those in the industry generally vary
depending upon the region and the industry user television and radio
broadcasters prefer longterm leases while wireless communications providers
favor somewhat shorter lease terms in both cases the leases often have
multiple renewals at the option of the tenant

  tenants tend to renew their leases because of the complications associated
with moving antennae for example in the case of cellular personal
communications services and other wireless users moving one antennae might
necessitate moving several others because of the interlocking gridlike nature
of wireless systems moreover a move by a television or radio broadcaster
would necessitate fcc approval and could entail major dislocations and the
uncertainty associated with building antennae in new coverage areas in
addition the increasing difficulty of obtaining local zoning approvals the
increasing environmental concerns of communities and the restrictions imposed
by the federal aviation administration and fcc tend to reduce the number of
choices available to a tower user

  most of our leases have escalator provisions these automatic increases are
based on specified estimated cost measures or on increases in the consumer
price index

  annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon

    size of the transmission line and the number and weight of the antennae
     on the tower
    existing capacity of the tower
    the placement of the customers antenna on the tower
    the location and height of the tower on which antenna space is rented
     and
    the competitive environment

  because of the factors listed above we believe that it is not possible to
state with any degree of precision the vacancy or unused capacity of a
typical tower group of related towers or all of our towers

  buildtosuit projects historically cellular and other wireless service
providers have constructed and owned a majority of the towers for their
antennae needs rather than leasing space on towers from a third party
beginning a few years ago wireless service providers expressed a growing
interest in having independent companies own and operate the towers for their
antennae we believe this trend is the result of a need among such providers to
preserve capital and to speed access to their markets by focusing on activities
that contribute to subscriber growth and by outsourcing infrastructure
requirements this trend has resulted in our entering into

agreements with a number of wireless carriers for buildtosuit projects in
buildtosuit projects we develop and construct a tower network for a major
anchor tenant after the anchor tenant signs a lease agreement with us because
we own the constructed towers we are able to rent space on them to other
tenants as well as to the anchor tenant

  these buildtosuit projects constitute a major part of our rental business
and have the following benefits for us

    buildtosuit projects generally reduce the financial risk of
     constructing new towers because they have a preestablished anchor
     tenant
    buildtosuit projects are often located in markets where we would like
     to expand our existing operations or in a new market where we would like
     to establish a presence and
    by utilizing our experienced inhouse network development services
     buildtosuit projects enable us to construct towers at costs that are
     generally less than the costs of acquiring towers this costefficiency
     reduces our weighted average cost per tower thereby improving the
     overall return of our rental and management business

  we are currently engaged in buildtosuit projects for the following
companies

   alltel                    att wireless           cingular wireless
   nextel                    omnipoint               verizon

  we continue to seek additional major buildtosuit projects although we may
not enter into any of them

  communications site management business we are a leading manager of
communications sites these sites include rooftop sites and ground towers a
central aspect of this business is the development by us of new sources of
revenue for building owners by effectively managing all aspects of rooftop and
ground tower telecommunications including

   twoway radio systems     microwave               fiber optics
   wireless cable            paging                  rooftop
   personal                  cellular                 infrastructure
    communications                                      construction
    services                                            services

  our management contracts for these sites are generally for a period of five
years and contain automatic fiveyear renewal periods subject to termination
by either party before renewal under these contracts we are responsible for a
wide range of activities including

    marketing antennae sites on the tower
    reviewing existing and negotiating future license agreements with tenant
     users
    managing and enforcing those agreements
    supervising installation of equipment by tenants to ensure non
     interference with other users
    supervising repairs and maintenance to the towers and
    site billing collections and contract administration

  in addition we handle all service related calls and questions regarding the
site so that the building management team or owner is relieved of this
responsibility for such services we are entitled to a percentage of lease
payments which is higher for new tenants than for existing tenants upon
termination of a contract unless it is because of our default we are
generally entitled to our percentage with respect to then existing tenants so
long as they remain tenants

 network development services

  through atc integrated services we provide comprehensive network development
services for both wireless service providers and broadcasters we offer full
turnkey network development solutions to our customers including

   radio frequency          tower construction      tower component part
    engineering consulting   network design           sales
   site acquisition         antennae                tower monitoring
   zoning and other          installation
    regulatory
    approvals

  we provide network development services to most of the major wireless service
providers and have constructed or are constructing towers on a buildtosuit
basis for a variety of wireless and broadcast companies we are increasingly
applying our site acquisition and construction capabilities for our own account
as we engage in more builttosuit and other proprietary construction projects

our ability to provide this full range of services is critical to our business
model because these services

    enhance our overall returns as our costs for constructing towers are
     generally lower than those we acquire
    make us a more attractive choice for builttosuit projects since we
     believe wireless carriers prefer to work with a national company rather
     than contract with multiple vendors to address their towerrelated
     needs
    strengthens our existing customer relationships by increasing our
     knowledge of our customers network needs which we believe leads to
     greater customer satisfaction and the opportunity to offer our customers
     other services and
    increase recurring revenues and cash flow from our towers for example
     throughout a customers lease with us we often perform antenna
     installationrelated services and radio frequency engineering services
     as our customers needs change and as their network develops and as
     part of routine maintenance

  site acquisition services we engage in site acquisition services for our own
account in connection with buildtosuit projects and other proprietary
construction as well as for third parties we provided site acquisition
services for some of the first personal communications services projects in the
united states including the personal communication services network that at
the time of launch had the largest number of sites in the united states we
provide these services nationally through our field offices in several major
cities including atlanta chicago charlotte cleveland jacksonville new
orleans and seattle our site acquisition services include

   site identification      geographic analysis     custom mapping
   market analysis          zoning review           zoning and other
                                                       governmental
                                                       approval

  the site selection and acquisition process begins with the network design we
identify highway corridors population centers and topographical features
within the carriers existing or proposed network we then conduct drive tests
in the area to monitor all personal communication services cellular and
enhanced specialized mobile radio frequencies to locate any systems then
operating in that area this enables us to identify where any holes in coverage
may exist based on this data we and the carrier develop a search ring
generally of onemile radius within which our site acquisition department
identifies land available either for purchase or lease our personnel select
the most suitable sites based on demographics traffic patterns and signal
characteristics if the customer approves the site we then submit it to the
local zoningplanning board for approval if we receive approval our customer
typically engages us to supervise the construction of the towers or to
construct the towers ourselves

                                       7

  we will continue to provide site acquisition services to those customers
desiring only these services however we also intend to continue to actively
market these services as part of a turnkey solution including network design
tower construction tower site leasing equipment installation and maintenance
that we offer prospective rental customers we believe that wireless service
providers will select companies that demonstrate the ability to successfully
locate acquire and permit sites and finance and construct towers in a timely
manner for their builttosuit projects

  engineering consulting services and network design through galaxy

  we construct towers both for our own account in connection with buildtosuit
projects and other proprietary construction projects as well as for third
parties for third party construction we bill customers on a fixed price or
time and materials basis and we may negotiate fees on individual sites or for
groups of sites

                                       8

the cost of construction of a tower varies both by site location which will
determine among other things the required height of the tower and type of
tower nonbroadcast towers whether on a rooftop or the ground generally cost
between approximately 185000 and 225000 broadcast towers are generally
much taller and are built to bear a greater load  the costs per broadcast
tower are significantly greater than nonbroadcast towers and vary based on
size location and terrain

  as part of our construction service and as a separate service offering we
provide antennae installation services these services use not only our
constructionrelated skills but also our technical expertise to ensure that
new installations do not cause interference with other tenants

  the number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on
whether the tower is broadcast or nonbroadcast and on the towers location
height and the loaded capacity at certain wind speeds an antennas height on a
tower and the towers location determine the lineofsight of the antenna with
the horizon and consequently the distance a signal can be transmitted some
of our customers including paging companies and specialized mobile radio
providers in rural areas need higher elevations for broader coverage other
customers such as personal communications services enhanced specialized
mobile radio and cellular companies in metropolitan areas usually do not need
to place their equipment at the highest tower point in most cases well
engineered and well located towers built to serve the specifications of an
initial anchor tenant in the wireless communications sector will attract three
or more additional wireless tenants over time thereby increasing revenue and
enhancing margins

  wireless components through mts wireless components we sell tower related
parts and equipment to wireless and broadcast companies including

    antennae fasteners and other mounting components
    waveguide bridge products
    square support rail

sa de cv a wireless service provider in mexico to form a strategic
alliance to build and operate towers throughout mexico in december 2000 we
revised the initial agreement and paid unefon approximately 150 million in
cash for its agreement to terminate the strategic alliance in connection with
this termination we modified our buildtosuit agreement with unefon which
now provides for us to construct for it up to 1000 sites on a buildtosuit
basis

  canadian joint venture in march 2000 we entered into a joint venture with
telemedia a privately held canadian telecommunications company to form
canadian tower lp canadian tower which is canadian controlled and operated
will develop and acquire wireless and broadcast towers throughout canada we
have committed to invest 180 million canadian in exchange for which we will
own 450 of canadian tower the joint ventures initial assets will include
more than 20 broadcast towers to be contributed by telemedia we plan for our
canadian operations to include sites in major metropolitan areas

 pending transactions as of december 31 2000

  as of december 31 2000 we were a party to various pending transactions
involving the acquisition of more than 2500 communications sites and related
businesses with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 8700 million
these transactions remain subject to regulatory approvals in certain cases and
other closing conditions which we may not meet the most significant of these
pending transactions is our agreement with alltel which is described under
significant agreements above

management organization

  our corporate headquarters is in boston massachusetts we are organized on a
regional basis with each region being headed by a vice president who reports
to our chief operating officer our current regional centers are based in
boston atlanta chicago houston the san francisco bay area and mexico city
we may establish additional regional centers over time including in canada
our regional centers are further subdivided into 20 area operations centers
our regional centers are responsible for legal and accounting functions and
our area operations centers are responsible for service sales and marketing
we believe our regional and area operations centers are capable of responding
effectively to the opportunities and customer needs of their defined geographic
areas our area operations centers are staffed with skilled engineering
construction management and marketing personnel

  we believe that over time we can achieve enhanced customer service and
greater operating efficiencies by further centralizing certain operating
functions including accounting and lease administration we are designing this
centralization of functions to enable key information about each site tower
lease and customer to become part of a centralized database linked to regional
and area operations centers

  through our various acquisitions and organic growth we believe we have
obtained the services of key personnel with skills in areas such as

    site acquisition

    zoning and other governmental approvals

    radio frequency engineering

    lease administration and

    finance

  as we seek to expand our size and improve on the quality and consistency of
our services we believe we may need to supplement our current workforce in
certain areas develop new regional centers and intensify our dedication to
customer service accordingly we are actively recruiting key personnel to
complete the staffing of our regional operations centers and to strengthen and
deepen our corporate group we focus our efforts on recruiting people from the
industry sectors we serve in addition in some instances we recruit skilled
engineering marketing and other personnel from outside the communications
site wireless communications and broadcasting industries

history

  in early 1995 steven b dodge the then chairman of the board president
and chief executive officer of american radio systems corporation american
radio and other members of its management recognized the opportunity in the
communications site industry as a consequence of its ownership and operation
of broadcast towers american radio formed our company to capitalize on this
opportunity american radio distributed its stock in our company to its
securityholders in connection with its merger with cbs in june 1998

regulatory matters

  towers both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless
communications and radio and television antennae these regulations control
the siting lighting marking and maintenance of towers depending on factors
such as height and proximity to public airfields the construction of new
antenna structures or modifications to existing antenna structures must be
reviewed by the faa prior to initiation to ensure that the structure will not
present a hazard to aircraft navigation after the faa issues a no hazard
determination the tower owner must register the antenna structure with the
fcc and paint and light the structure in accordance with the faa
determination the faa review and the fcc registration processes are
prerequisites to fcc authorization of communications devices placed on the
antenna structure

  the fcc separately regulates and licenses wireless communications devices
operating on towers based upon the particular frequency used in addition the
fcc separately licenses and regulates television and radio stations
broadcasting from towers tower owners bear the responsibility for notifying
the faa of any tower lighting failures and the repair of those lighting
failures tower owners also must notify the fcc when the ownership of a tower
changes we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply
with applicable standards failure to comply with applicable towerrelated
requirements may lead to monetary penalties

  in january 2001 the fcc concluded investigations of several operators of
communications towers including us the fcc sent us a notice of apparent
liability for forfeiture preliminarily determining that we had failed to file
certain informational forms had failed to properly post certain information
at various tower sites and on one occasion had failed to properly light a
tower the fcc has proposed a fine of 212000 and intends to undertake an
additional review of our overall procedures for and degree of compliance with
the fccs regulations the proposed fine represents a significant increase
from the amount that otherwise might be

                                      14
page

imposed in similar situations because of the number of violations and the fccs
negative perception of our compliance depending on the outcome of the further
investigation the fcc could take additional adverse action against us we are
conducting our own internal investigation into our regulatory compliance
policies as permitted by the fccs regulations on march 1 2001 we filed a
response to the notice of apparent liability for forfeiture requesting that the
forfeiture be reduced we intend to cooperate further with the fcc in any
additional investigation to resolve these matters

  the introduction and development of digital television may affect us and some
of our broadcast customers the need to install additional antennae required to
deliver digital television service may necessitate the relocation of many
currently colocated fm antennae the need to secure state and local regulatory
approvals for the construction and reconstruction of this substantial number of
antennae and the structures on which they are mounted presents a potentially
significant regulatory obstacle to the communications site industry as a
result the fcc solicited comments on whether and in what circumstances the
fcc should preempt state and local zoning and land use laws and ordinances
regulating the placement and construction of communications sites federal
preemptive regulations may never be promulgated if adopted they may be more
or less restrictive than existing state and local regulations in addition
those regulations if challenged on constitutional grounds may not be upheld

  local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning
restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities these
regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval
from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower
construction local regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction or
site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer
demand in addition those regulations increase costs associated with new tower
construction existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the timing or
cost of new tower construction and additional regulations may be adopted which
increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could
materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or
liquidity

  our tower operations in mexico are also subject to regulation as we pursue
additional international opportunities we will be subject to regulations in
additional foreign jurisdictions in addition our customers both domestic and
foreign also may be subject to new regulatory policies that may adversely
affect the demand for communications sites

  verestar we are required to obtain authorization from the fcc for our use of
radio frequencies to provide satellite and wireless services in the united
states we are also required to obtain authorizations from foreign regulatory
agencies in connection with our provision of these services abroad we hold a
number of pointtopoint microwave radio licenses that are used to provide
telecommunications services additionally we hold a number of satellite earth
station licenses in connection with our operation of satellitebased networks
we are required to obtain consent from the fcc prior to assigning these
licenses or transferring control of any of our companies holding an fcc
license we also provide maritime communications services pursuant to an
experimental license and a grant of special temporary authority we also filed
32 applications for permanent fullterm fcc licenses to operate shipboard earth
stations in fixed ports those applications are pending we may not be granted
permanent licenses and the experimental license and special temporary
authority currently being used may not be renewed for future terms any license
granted by the fcc may require substantial payments by us

environmental matters

  our operations are subject to federal state and local and foreign laws
ordinances and regulations relating to the management use storage disposal
emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous
substances materials and waste as the owner andor operator of real property
and facilities these laws ordinances and regulations may impose liability on
us for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and
groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes certain of these
laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the
owner or operator of the real estate or

                                       15
page

facility knew of or was responsible for the contamination and whether or not
operations at the property have been discontinued or title to the property has
been transferred the owner or operator of contaminated real estate also may be
subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs
resulting from offsite migration of the contamination in connection with our
former and current ownership or operation of our properties we may be
potentially liable for those types of environmental costs

  we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws we have not received any written notice from any
governmental authority or third party asserting and we are not otherwise aware
of any material environmental noncompliance liability or claim however we
might be liable in the future for existing environmental conditions we also
may incur costs for future regulatory action as well as compliance with
existing and future environmental laws the foregoing could have a material
adverse affect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

competition and new technologies

  rental and management segment competition we compete for antennae site
customers with other national independent tower companies wireless carriers
that own and operate their own tower networks and lease tower space to other
carriers site development companies that acquire space on existing towers for
wireless service providers and manage new tower construction and traditional
local independent tower operators we believe that tower location and capacity
price quality of service and density within a geographic market historically
have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors
affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites

  we face strong competition for buildtosuit opportunities particularly
those with the remaining wireless service providers seeking to divest their
tower ownership principally from other independent tower companies and site
developers

  we compete for tower and site acquisitions principally with other independent
tower owners and operators competition may intensify and result in
substantially higher prices particularly for towers being divested by wireless
service providers we may not therefore be able to complete acquisitions on
as favorable terms as in the past under certain circumstances we may also be
required to pay higher prices or agree to less favorable terms than we would
otherwise have desired we may also be impeded in our future acquisition
activities by antitrust constraints either in local markets or on a regional
or national basis

  network development services segment competition we compete as to network
development services with a variety of companies offering individual or
combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site
acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway
consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio
frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which
provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and
carriers internal staffs we believe that carriers base their decisions on
network development services on various criteria including a companys
experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a
project various elements of our components business compete with numerous
other companies

  satellite and fiber network access services segment competition in the
delivery of domestic and international satellite services we compete with
other full service teleports in the united states and satellite communications
companies the bases of competition are primarily reliability price and
transmission quality competition is expected principally from a number of
domestic and foreign telecommunications carriers and satellite owners many of
which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do in
the maritime telecommunications market we compete primarily with several other
companies that provide similar telecommunications services several of these
companies have fcc licenses that are similar to ours and own their own
satellites

                                       16
page

  we believe that we compete favorably as to the key competitive factors
relating to each of our business segments

  new technologies the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for
towerbased transmission and reception and may thereby have a negative impact
on our operations for example the fcc has granted license applications for
several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide
mobile voice andor data services in addition the emergence of new
technologies could reduce the need for towerbased transmission and reception
and have an adverse effect on our operations additionally the growth in
delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites and the development
and implementation of signal combining technologies which permit one antenna
to service two different frequencies of transmission and thereby two
customers may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission and hence
demand for tower space

  finally any increase in the use of roaming or resale arrangements by
wireless service providers would adversely affect the demand for tower space
these arrangements enable a provider to serve customers outside its license
area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve
overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the
wireless marketplace wireless service providers might consider such roaming
and resale arrangements as superior to constructing their own facilities or
leasing antenna space from us

construction manufacturing and raw materials

  we build maintain and install land based wireless communications and
broadcast transmitting and receiving facilities by obtaining sheet metal and
other raw material parts and components from a variety of vendors we also
engage third party contract manufacturers to construct certain of these
wireless transmitting and receiving and broadcast facilities we have
historically obtained the majority of our sheet metal and other raw materials
parts and components including for our components business from a limited
number of suppliers however substantially all of these items are available
from numerous other suppliers we have not to date experienced any
significant difficulties in obtaining the needed quantities of materials from
suppliers in a timely manner

employees

  as of december 31 2000 we employed approximately 3300 full time
individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

factors that may affect future results

  we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks
some of which are beyond our control the following discussion highlights some
of the risks that may affect future operating results

 decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our
operating results and we cannot control that demand

  many of the factors affecting the demand for tower space and to a lesser
extent our services business affect our operating results those factors
include

    consumer demand for wireless services
    the financial condition of wireless service providers and their
     preference for owning rather than leasing antenna sites
    the growth rate of wireless communications or of a particular wireless
     segment
    the number of wireless service providers in a particular segment
     nationally or locally

                                       17
page

    governmental licensing of broadcast rights
    increased use of roaming and resale arrangements by wireless service
     providers these arrangements enable a provider to serve customers
     outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter
     into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit
     nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace wireless
     service providers might consider such roaming and resale arrangements as
     superior to constructing their own facilities or leasing antenna space
     from us
    zoning environmental and other government regulations and
    technological changes

  the demand for antenna space is dependent to a significantly lesser extent
on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things
technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio
may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission we could also be
affected adversely should the development of digital television be delayed or
impaired or if demand for it were to be less than anticipated because of
delays disappointing technical performance or cost to the consumer

  a significant general slow down in the economy in 2001 or beyond could
negatively affect the foregoing factors influencing demand for tower space and
tower related services for example such a slow down could reduce consumer
demand for wireless services thereby causing providers to delay implementation
of new systems and the introduction of new technologies we also believe that
the economic slow down in 2001 has already harmed and may continue to harm
the financial condition of some wireless service providers

 our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our
cash flow and our ability to make payments on our senior notes

  we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness after giving effect
to our sale of 100 million shares of class a common stock in january 2001 our
sale of 10 billion of 9 38 senior notes due 2009 in january 2001 and
borrowings that we assume we would have made to close acquisitions that were
pending as of december 31 2000 we would have had at december 31 2000
approximately 34 billion of consolidated debt our substantial level of
indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash
sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due
in respect of our indebtedness we may also obtain additional longterm debt
and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs this would
have the effect of increasing our total leverage

  our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences
 including

    increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
     conditions
    limiting our ability to obtain additional financing
    requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from
     operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of
     our cash flow available for other purposes including capital
     expenditures
    requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our
     core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations
    limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our
     business and the industries in which we compete and
    placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged
     competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital
     resources

  a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at
floating rates as a result our interest payment obligations on such
indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase

 restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior notes could
adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility

                                       18
page

  the indenture for our senior notes due 2009 and our credit facilities contain
restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take various actions and engage
in various types of transactions these restrictions include

    paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments
    incurring more debt guaranteeing indebtedness and issuing preferred
     stock
    issuing stock of certain subsidiaries
    making certain investments
    creating liens
    entering into transactions with affiliates
    entering into saleleaseback transactions and
    merging consolidating or selling assets

  these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our
ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition or other
corporate opportunities

 buildtosuit construction projects and major acquisitions from wireless
service providers increase our dependence on a limited number of customers the
loss of which could materially decrease revenues and may also involve less
favorable terms

  our focus on major buildtosuit projects for wireless service providers and
related acquisitions entail several unique risks first is our greater
dependence on a limited number of customers and the risk that customer losses
could materially decrease revenues another risk is that our agreements with
these wireless service providers have lease and control terms that are more
favorable to them than the terms we give our tenants generally in addition
although we have the benefit of an anchor tenant in buildtosuit projects we
may not be able to find a sufficient number of additional tenants in fact one
reason wireless service providers may prefer buildtosuit arrangements is to
share or escape the costs of an undesirable site a site may be undesirable
because it has high construction costs or may be considered a poor location by
other providers

 our expanded construction program increases our exposure to risks that could
increase costs and adversely affect our earnings and growth

  our expanded construction activities involve substantial risks these risks
include

    increasing our debt and the amount of payments on that debt
    increasing competition for construction sites and experienced tower
     construction companies resulting in significantly higher costs and
     failure to meet time schedules
    failing to meet time schedules which could result in our paying
     significant penalties to prospective tenants particularly in buildto
     suit situations and
    possible lack of sufficient experienced personnel to manage an expanded
     construction program

 if we are unable to construct or acquire new towers at the pace in the
locations and at the costs that we desire our business would be adversely
affected

  our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to construct and acquire
towers in locations and on a time schedule that meets the requirements of our
customers if our tower construction and acquisition projects fail to meet the
requirements of our customers or fail to meet their requirements at our
projected costs our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to
build new towers where and when our customers require them or where and when
we believe the best opportunity to add tenants exists we could fail to meet
our contractual obligations under buildtosuit agreements and we could lose
opportunities to lease space on our towers our ability to construct a tower at
a location on a schedule and at a cost we project can be affected by a number
of factors beyond our control including

    zoning and local permitting requirements and national regulatory
     approvals
    environmental opposition

                                       19
page

    availability of skilled construction personnel and construction
     equipment
    adverse weather conditions and
    increased competition for tower sites construction materials and labor

 increasing competition in the satellite and fiber network access services
market may slow verestars growth and adversely affect its business

  in the satellite and fiber network access services market verestar competes
with other satellite communications companies that provide similar services as
well as other communications service providers some of verestars existing and
potential competitors consist of companies from whom verestar currently leases
satellite and fiber network access in connection with the provision of
verestars services to its customers increased competition could result in
verestar being forced to reduce the fees it charges for its services and may
limit verestars ability to obtain on economical terms services that are
critical to its business we anticipate that verestars competitors may develop
or acquire services that provide functionality that is similar to that provided
by verestars services and that those competitive services may be offered at
significantly lower prices or bundled with other services many of the existing
and potential competitors have financial and other resources significantly
greater than those available to verestar

 if we cannot keep raising capital our growth will be impeded

  without additional capital we would need to curtail our acquisition and
construction programs that are essential for our longterm success we expect
to use borrowed funds to satisfy a substantial portion of our capital needs
however we must continue to satisfy financial ratios and to comply with
financial and other covenants in order to do so if our revenues and cash flow
do not meet expectations we may lose our ability to borrow money or to do so
on terms we consider to be favorable conditions in the capital markets also
will affect our ability to borrow as well as the terms of those borrowings
all of these factors could also make it difficult or impossible for us
otherwise to raise capital particularly on terms we would consider favorable

 if we cannot successfully integrate acquired sites or businesses or manage our
operations as we grow our business will be adversely affected and our growth
may slow or stop

  a significant part of our growth strategy is the continued pursuit of
strategic acquisitions of independent tower operators and consolidators
wireless service providers and service and satellite and fiber network access
services businesses we cannot assure you however that we will be able to
integrate successfully acquired businesses and assets into our existing
business during 2000 we have consummated more than 60 transactions involving
the acquisition of more than 4600 communications sites and related businesses
and several satellite and fiber network access services businesses and related
businesses our growth has placed and will continue to place a significant
strain on our management and operating and financial systems successful
integration of these and any future acquisitions will depend primarily on our
ability to manage these assets and combined operations and with respect to the
services and satellite and fiber network access services businesses to
integrate new management and employees into our existing operations

 if our chief executive officer left we would be adversely affected because we
rely on his reputation and expertise and because of our relatively small
senior management team

  the loss of our chief executive officer steven b dodge has a greater
likelihood of having a material adverse effect upon us than it would on most
other companies of our size because of our comparatively smaller executive
group and our reliance on mr dodges expertise our growth strategy is highly
dependent on the efforts of mr dodge our ability to raise capital also
depends significantly on the reputation of mr dodge you should be aware that
we have not entered into an employment agreement with mr dodge the tower
industry is relatively new and does not have a large group of seasoned
executives from which we could recruit a replacement for mr dodge

 expanding operations into foreign countries could create expropriation
governmental regulation funds inaccessibility foreign exchange exposure and
management problems

  our recent expansion into canada and mexico and other possible foreign
operations in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and
operational problems not experienced in the united states we have made a
substantial loan to a mexican company and are committed to construct a sizable
number of towers in that country we have also invested in a canadian joint
venture that intends to acquire and construct towers in that country we may
also engage in comparable transactions in other countries in the future among
the risks of foreign operations are governmental expropriation and regulation
inability to repatriate earnings or other funds currency fluctuations
difficulty in recruiting trained personnel and language and cultural
differences all of which could adversely affect operations

 new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable
to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues

  the development and implementation of signal combining technologies which
permit one antenna to service two different transmission frequencies and
thereby two customers may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast
transmission and hence demand for our antenna space

  mobile satellite systems and other new technologies could compete with land
based wireless communications systems thereby reducing the demand for tower
lease space and other services we provide the federal communication commission
has granted license applications for several lowearth orbiting satellite
systems that are intended to provide mobile voice or data services in
addition the emergence of new technologies could reduce the need for tower
based transmission and reception and have an adverse effect on our operations
the growth in delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites could
also adversely affect demand for our antenna space

 we could have liability under environmental laws

  under various federal state and local environmental laws we as an owner
lessee or operator of more than 13600 real estate sites after giving effect
to our pending transactions may be liable for the substantial costs of
remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous wastes for a
discussion of our risks relating to environmental matters see environmental
matters above

 our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or
future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business
as we currently do

  we are subject to federal state and local and foreign regulation of our
business both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless
communications and radio and television antennae in addition the fcc
separately regulates wireless communication devices operating on towers and
licenses and regulates television and radio stations broadcasting from towers
similar regulations exist in mexico canada and other foreign countries
regarding wireless communications and the operation of communications towers
failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to monetary penalties
and may require us to indemnify our customers against any such failure to
comply new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may
affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth

  on january 16 2001 the fcc issued a notice of apparent liability for
forfeiture against us for apparent violations of some fcc rules regarding the
registration of communication towers and in one instance the lighting
requirements for communication towers this action involves a proposed fine of
212000 in addition the fcc has ordered its enforcement division to conduct
a further investigation of our administrative compliance at this time we are
unable to predict the outcome of the notice of apparent liability for
forfeiture or any further investigation for a more complete discussion of the
regulatory risks affecting the various aspects of our business and a recent
fcc investigation of our towers see regulatory matters above


                                       21

 our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived
health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are
substantiated

  public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other
wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies
which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception
of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the
market acceptance of wireless communications services

  if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects
including cancer were established our operations costs and revenues would be
materially and adversely affected we do not maintain any significant insurance
with respect to these matters

 control by our principal stockholders could deter mergers where you could get
more than current market price for your stock

  steven b dodge together with his affiliates owned approximately 260 of
our total voting power as of february 28 2001 control by mr dodge and others
may discourage a merger or other takeover of our company in which holders of
common stock may be paid a premium for their shares over thencurrent market
prices mr dodge together with a limited number of our directors may be able
to control or block the vote on mergers and other matters submitted to the
common stockholders

     our snaps occupy over 180 acres of land including 164 acres that we own
     and 19 acres that we lease all but one of these properties are located
     throughout the united states and range in size from two to seventyacre
     parcels we also own one property in switzerland

  our interests in communications sites are comprised of a variety of fee and
leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements
and easements licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities in
rural areas a communications site typically consists of a threetofiveacre
tract which supports towers equipment shelters and guy wires to stabilize the
structure less than 2500 square feet are required for a monopole or self
supporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas
land leases generally have 20 to 25year terms with three fiveyear renewals
or are for fiveyear terms with automatic renewals unless we otherwise specify

  pursuant to our credit facilities the lenders have liens on among other
things all tenant leases contracts relating to the management of towers for
others cash accounts receivable the stock and other equity interests of
virtually all of our subsidiaries and all intercompany debt inventory and
other personal property fixtures including towers intellectual property as
well as certain fee and leasehold interests and the proceeds of the foregoing

  we believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to
meet our anticipated needs



item 3 legal proceedings

  we periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are
incidental to our business we believe that no matters currently pending would

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

general

  in early 1995 steven b dodge the then chairman of the board president and
chief executive officer of american radio and other members of american
radios management recognized the opportunity in the communications site
industry as a consequence of american radios ownership and operation of
broadcast towers our company was formed to capitalize on this opportunity
american radio distributed its stock in our company to its securityholders in
connection with its merger with cbs in june 1998 as a result our consolidated
financial statements may not reflect our results of operations or financial
position had we been an independent public company during the period prior to
june 1998

  we are a leading wireless and broadcast communications infrastructure company
operating in three business segments

    rental and management we operate the largest network of wireless
     communications towers in north america and are the largest independent
     operator of broadcast towers in north america based on number of
     towers

    network development services we provide comprehensive network
     development services and components for wireless service providers and
     broadcasters

    satellite and fiber network access services our verestar subsidiary is
     a leading provider of integrated satellite and fiber network access
     services based upon the number of teleport antennae and facilities we
     provide these services to telecommunications companies isps
     broadcasters and maritime customers both domestic and international we
     previously referred to our satellite and fiber network access services
     segment as internet voice data and video transmission or ivdv

  during the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 we acquired various
communications sites service businesses and satellite and fiber network access
related businesses for aggregate purchase prices of approximately 18 billion
12 billion and 8538 million respectively we expect that acquisitions
consummated to date will have a material impact on future revenues expenses
and income from operations in addition certain historical financial
information presented below and elsewhere in this document does not reflect the
impact of our construction program to any significant extent because most of
that activity is of a more recent origin and is expected to continue during
2001 and thereafter

communications sites as compared to approximately 5100 communications sites
as of december 31 1999 the acquisitions and construction completed in 2000
and 1999 have significantly affected operations for the year ended december 31

 rental and management revenue

  rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2000 was 2782
million an increase of 1429 million from the year ended december 31 1999
the increase can be primarily attributed to two factors the acquisition and
construction of towers in 2000 and the latter part of 1999 and increased lease
ups utilization of new and existing towers during 2000 we continued to
implement our growth strategy by aggressively acquiring and building new
towers with the consummation of the airtouch att and other transactions we
acquired more than 4600 towers in 2000 this coupled with the construction of
over 1600 towers in 2000 increased the scope depth and strength of our
national and international tower footprint providing us with a much larger base
of towers generating revenue in 2000 as compared to 1999

in the longterm we believe that our leasing revenues are likely to grow at a
more rapid rate than revenues from other segments of our business because of
increasing utilization of existing tower capacity recent and pending
acquisitions and buildtosuit and other construction activities

                                       29
page

  additionally during 2000 we also focused on implementing an area management
structure that enhances sales and marketing enabling us to increase the
utilization of both previously existing prior to january 2000 and newly
acquiredconstructed towers increased utilization resulted in increases in
revenue in 2000 for towers that were in our portfolio as of january 1 2000

 network development services revenue

  network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 2000 was
3119 million an increase of 2215 million from revenue for the year ended
december 31 1999 the significant growth in revenues during 2000 resulted from
strategic acquisitions and increased demand for installation work and component
parts from major wireless carriers

  during 2000 we acquired several key services companies that added additional
revenue and expanded our inhouse services capabilities among the acquisitions
were galaxy engineering services which enables us to perform an array of radio
frequency engineering and network design services such as drive testing voice
quality analysis and transport engineering and kline iron  steel co a steel
fabrication company with expertise in broadcast towers in addition increased
demand for some of our network development services such as equipment
installation maintenance and sales of component parts also created additional
revenue in 2000 much of this increased demand was a result of aggressive
network expansion programs initiated by major wireless communications carriers
during the year in contrast our revenues from site acquisition and
construction work for others which are also part of our network development
services segment have declined and we believe will continue to decline as a
percentage of our total revenues this decline is attributable to the trend in
the wireless communications industry to outsource tower infrastructure needs
this trend means we are increasingly applying our site acquisition and
construction capabilities to our buildtosuit projects and for other
construction for our own account

 satellite and fiber network access services revenue

  satellite and fiber network access services revenue for the year ended
december 31 2000 was 1452 million an increase of 1128 million from
revenue for the year ended december 31 1999 the majority of the increase can
be attributed to the consummation of several key acquisitions that occurred in
2000 and the fourth quarter of 1999 including icg satellite services general
telecom us electrodynamics and publicom these acquisitions significantly
increased our service capabilities revenue base and geographical scope of our
customers as well as providing significant incremental revenues in 2000 we
also experienced an increase in demand of the internet and data requirements of
our internet service provider customers in 2000

 rental and management expense

  rental and management expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was 1392
million an increase of 768 million from the year ended december 31 1999 a
significant portion of the increase is attributable to incremental operating
expenses incurred in 2000 for towers that were acquired or constructed during
2000 and the latter part of 1999 as discussed above the remaining component of
the increase is primarily related to additional expenses incurred by us in 2000
to implement our area management structure together with to a lesser extent
increases in operating expenses on certain towers that existed in 1999

 network development services expense

  network development services expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was
2748 million an increase of 2055 million from the year ended december 31
1999 the significant increase in expense is primarily due to the strategic
acquisitions consummated in 2000 as discussed above in addition we incurred
expenses in 2000 to transition a portion of our specialty constructors unit
from tower construction work to equipment installation and other services in
part this transition is related to an ongoing process to decentralize some of
our tower construction capabilities and develop some of those capabilities at
our regional and area

                                       30
page

locations remaining increases in expense are directly related to a charge for
a bad debt reserve of approximately 70 million recorded in the fourth quarter
and overall increases in the amount of services and component sales to
customers

 satellite and fiber network access services expense

  satellite and fiber network access services expense for the year ended
december 31 2000 was 1101 million an increase of 860 million from the
year ended december 31 1999 substantially all of the increase can be
attributed to the strategic acquisitions discussed above together with
additional expenses related to integrating those acquisitions remaining
increases are related to the building of infrastructure to help manage the
growth of this segment and overall increases in volume

 depreciation and amortization

  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2000 was 2834
million an increase of 1508 million from the year ended december 31 1999 a
component of the increase is attributable to an increase in depreciation
expense of 748 million this is a direct result of our purchase construction
and acquisition of approximately 13 billion of property and equipment during
2000 the remaining component of the increase is an increase in amortization of
760 million resulting from our recording and amortizing approximately 13
billion of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions
consummated during 2000

 development expense

  development expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was 145 million
an increase of 129 million from the year ended december 31 1999 the
majority of the increase represents costs related to tower site inspections
related data gathering and certain integration expenses related to acquisitions
consummated in 2000 the remaining component of the increase represents
expenses incurred in connection with abandoned acquisitions and other
acquisition related costs which are not capitalized in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles

 corporate general and administrative expense

  corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31
2000 was 150 million an increase of 58 million from the year ended
december 31 1999 the majority of the increase is a result of higher
personnel marketing professional services and information technology costs
associated with supporting our increasing number of towers the growth of our
other businesses our expanding revenue base and our growth strategy

 interest expense

  interest expense for the year ended december 31 2000 was 1568 million an
increase of 1293 million from the year ended december 31 1999 this increase
is primarily related to increased borrowings to finance acquisitions and
construction the net change specifically is attributable to increases in
interest incurred on our outstanding debt obligations of 1317 million and
deferred financing amortization of 56 million these interest increases were
offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to construction projects
of 80 million

 interest income and other net

  interest income and other net for the year ended december 31 2000 was 130
million a decrease of 47 million from the year ended december 31 1999 the
decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest earned on invested
cash on hand of 46 million as a consequence of such cash being used to
finance acquisitions and construction

 interest incometv azteca net

  interest incometv azteca net for the year ended december 31 2000 was
127 million an increase of 108 million for the year ended december 31
1999 amounts included within this caption at december 31 2000 represent
interest earned on our note receivable from tv azteca of 137 million offset
by interest expense of 10 million

 premium on note conversion

  during the year ended december 31 2000 we acquired a portion of our 625
and 225 convertible notes in exchange for shares of our class a common stock
as a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders
we recorded an expense related to the premium on note conversion of
approximately 170 million during the second quarter of 2000 which represents
the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to induce them to
convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date

 income taxes

  the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2000 was 597
million an increase of 599 million from the year ended december 31 1999
the primary reason for the increase is a result of an increase in our loss
before income taxes and extraordinary losses partially offset by an increase
in amortization of nondeductible intangible assets arising from stock
acquisitions consummated in the years ended december 31 2000 and 1999 the
effective tax rate differs in both periods from the statutory rate due to the
effect of nondeductible items principally the amortization of goodwill on
certain stock acquisitions and for the year ended december 31 2000 the non
deductible note conversion expense on which we have recorded no tax benefit

  in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax asset we analyzed our
forecast of future taxable income and concluded that after recording a
valuation allowance of 60 million related to a portion of our state net
operating loss carryforwards recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax
asset is more likely than not the realization of the deferred tax asset is not
dependent upon significant changes in the current relationship between income
reported for financial and tax purposes or material asset sales or other
transactions not in the ordinary course of business

 extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt

  we have incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt in 2000
of 43 million the losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and
restatement of our primary credit facilities 30 million net of a tax
benefit of 20 million and our early retirement of debt assumed in the
unisite inc merger 13 million net of a tax benefit of 09 million

 rental and management revenue

  rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 1999 was 1353
million an increase of 748 million from the year ended december 31 1998
the majority of the increase 564 million is attributable to revenue
generated from acquisitions consummated andor towers constructed subsequent to
december 31 1998 the remaining factor contributing to the additional revenue
is an increase in comparable tower revenue of 184 million during 1999 for
towers that existed during 1998

 network development services revenue

  network development services revenue for the year ended december 31 1999 was
904 million an increase of 671 million from the year ended december 31
1998 the primary reason for the increase is due to the 667 million of
revenue earned after the merger with omniamerica inc the remaining component
of the increase is attributable to revenue generated from our existing services
business of approximately 04 million

 satellite and fiber network access services revenue

  satellite and fiber network access services revenue for the year ended
december 31 1999 was 324 million an increase of 126 million from the year
ended december 31 1998 the primary reason for the increase is the
approximately 99 million of revenue earned during 1999 as a result of
acquisitions consummated in 1999 the remaining component of the increase 27
million is an increase in revenue from the satellite and fiber network access
services business that existed at december 31 1998

 rental and management network development services and satellite and fiber
network access services expenses

  rental and management network development services and satellite and fiber
network access services expenses for the year ended december 31 1999 were
624 million 693 million and 241 million respectively an increase of
330 million 498 million and 113 million respectively from the year
ended december 31 1998 the primary reasons for the increase in these expenses
are essentially the same as those discussed above under each respective revenue
segment

 depreciation and amortization

  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 1999 was 1325
million an increase of 805 million from the year ended december 31 1998 a
component of the increase is attributable to an increase in depreciation
expense of 305 million resulting from our purchase construction andor
acquisition of approximately 6934 million of property and equipment during
1999 the remaining component of the increase is an increase in amortization
expense of 500 million resulting from our amortization of approximately
7517 million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions
consummated during 1999

 tower separation expense

  we completed our separation from american radio in 1998 no additional
expenses related to the separation were incurred in 1999 nor are any expected
to occur in the future see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for
a description of tower separation expense

 corporate general and administrative expense

  corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31
1999 was 91 million an increase of 40 million from the year ended december
31 1998 the majority of this increase resulted from higher personnel and
marketing costs associated with our growing revenue base and market position
the remaining component of the increase is the overall increases in other
administrative expenses incurred in supporting our growth

 development expense

  development expense for the year ended december 31 1999 was 16 million
these expenses include abandoned acquisition costs costs to integrate
acquisitions and costs associated with new business initiatives

 interest expense

  interest expense for the year ended december 31 1999 was 275 million an
increase of 43 million from the year ended december 31 1998 the increase is
primarily attributable to an increase of interest on our outstanding debt
obligations 94 million and amortization of deferred financing costs 07
million these interest increases were offset by a decrease of 31 million in
interest incurred during 1998 on our outstanding redeemable preferred stock
which was redeemed in july 1998 as well as an increase in interest
capitalized during the year ended december 31 1999

 interest income and other net

  interest income and other net for the year ended december 31 1999 was 177
million an increase of 85 million from the year ended december 31 1998 the
increase is primarily related to an increase in interest earned on invested
cash on hand 49 million interest earned on notes receivable 14 million
and interest earned on securityescrow deposits 22 million

 interest incometv azteca

  interest incometv azteca for the year ended december 31 1999 was 19
million amounts included within this caption represent interest earned on our
notes receivable from tv azteca

 income taxes

  the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 1999 was 02
million a decrease of 47 million from the income tax benefit recorded for
the year ended december 31 1998 the decrease in the tax benefit is due to an
increase in nondeductible permanent items principally goodwill amortization
the increase in nondeductible permanent items occurred as a result of the
consummation of several mergers and acquisitions in 1999

  as of december 31 1999 we had a net deferred tax asset of 1160 million
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax asset we analyzed our
forecast of future taxable income and concluded that recoverability of the net
deferred tax asset is more likely than not the realization of the deferred tax
asset is not dependent upon significant changes in the current relationship
between income reported for financial and tax purposes or material asset sales
or other transactions not in the ordinary course of business

 extraordinary losses

  we incurred an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt in 1999 of
14 million due to the early repayment of one of our term loans we recorded
an extraordinary loss of 14 million in 1998 due to the refinancing of our
then existing credit facility we also recorded an extraordinary loss of 75
million in 1998 due to the redemption of our interim preferred stock

liquidity and capital resources

  our liquidity needs arise from our acquisitionrelated activities debt
service working capital and capital expenditures associated principally with
our construction program as of december 31 2000 we had approximately 820
million in cash and cash equivalents working capital of approximately 1734
million and had approximately 3000 million of available borrowings under our
credit facilities

  historically we have met our operational liquidity needs primarily with
internally generated funds and have financed our acquisitions and our
construction program including related working capital needs with a
combination of capital funds from sales of our equity and debt securities and
bank borrowings we expect that this trend will continue in 2001

  our 2001 capital budget provides for expenditures of approximately 6000
million which includes towers to be built under existing buildtosuit
agreements in addition based on the transactions executed to date we expect
to close on pending transactions of approximately 8000 million in 2001
lastly we believe that debt service requirements will be significant in 2001
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents which include proceeds from
our equity and senior note offerings in 2001 and existing borrowing capacity
under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet these above cash
requirements if we were to effect more than one or possibly two major new
acquisitions in the next twelve months we would likely require additional
funds from external sources

  for the year ended december 31 2000 cash flows used for operating
activities were 250 million as compared to cash flows provided by operating
activities of 970 million for the year ended december 31 1999 the primary
reasons for the decrease are increased interest payments the paydown of
current liabilities assumed through acquisitions and an increase in current
assets

  for the year ended december 31 2000 cash flows used for investing
activities were 20 billion as compared to 11 billion for the year ended
december 31 1999 the increase in 2000 is primarily due to a net increase in
cash expended for mergers and acquisitions coupled with an increase in
property and equipment expenditures

  for the year ended december 31 2000 cash flows provided by financing
activities were 21 billion as compared to 8797 million for the year ended
december 31 1999 the increase is primarily related to increased net
borrowings under our credit facilities offset by a decrease in proceeds from
the issuance of debt and equity securities

  as of december 31 2000 we had outstanding the indebtedness as described
below under credit facilities and equity offerings and note placements
in addition as of december 31 2000 we had outstanding 2127 million
principal amount of our 625 convertible notes due october 15 2009 and 2582
million principal amount of our 225 convertible notes due october 15 2009
and other debt of approximately 1973 million see note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements we may need to raise cash from external sources to meet
our debt service obligations and to pay the principal amounts of our
indebtedness when due

  credit facilities our credit facilities provide us with a borrowing capacity
of up to 20 billion with the option to increase the capacity up to an
additional 5000 million subject to lender approval borrowings under the
credit facilities are subject to certain borrowing base restrictions such as
operating cash flow and construction cost levels our credit facilities
currently include a 6500 million revolving credit facility which was fully
available subject to the borrowing base restrictions on december 31 2000
maturing on june 30 2007 an 8500 million multidraw term loan a which was
fully drawn on december 31 2000 maturing on june 30 2007 and a 5000
million term loan b which was fully drawn on december 31 2000 maturing on
december 31 2007 the credit facilities are scheduled to amortize quarterly
commencing in march 2003

  our credit facilities contain certain financial and operational covenants and
other restrictions with which the borrower subsidiaries and the restricted
subsidiaries must comply whether or not there are any borrowings outstanding
we and the restricted subsidiaries have guaranteed all of the loans we have
secured the loans by liens on substantially all assets of the borrower
subsidiaries and the restricted subsidiaries and substantially all outstanding
capital stock and other debt and equity interests of all of our direct and
indirect subsidiaries

  under our credit facilities we are also required to maintain an interest
reserve for our convertible notes and our senior notes these funds can only be
used to make scheduled interest payments on our outstanding convertible notes
and senior notes as of december 31 2000 we had approximately 460 million of
restricted cash related to such interest reserve

  atc mexico loan agreement in february 2001 our mexican subsidiary american
tower corporation de mexico s de rl de cv which we refer to as atc
mexico and two of its subsidiaries consummated a loan agreement with a group
of banks providing a credit facility of an initial aggregate amount of 950
million if additional lenders are made party to the agreement the size of the
facility may increase to 1400 million we have committed to atc mexico to
loan up to 450 million if additional lenders are not made party to the
agreement our committment will be reduced on a dollarfordollar basis if
additional lenders join the atc mexico loan agreement this credit facility
requires maintenance of various financial covenants and ratios and is
guaranteed and collateralized by substantially all of the assets of atc mexico
and the assets of its subsidiaries all amounts borrowed under this loan
agreement are due on september 30 2003 the lenders commitment to make loans
under the loan agreement expires on march 31 2002 as of march 2001 an
aggregate of 950 million was outstanding under this loan agreement

  equity offerings and note placements during 2000 we consummated a public
offering of 125 million shares of our class a common stock for total net
proceeds of approximately 5139 million in addition we consummated a private
placement of 4500 million of 50 convertible notes issued at 100 of their
face amount the convertible notes mature in february 2010 and require interest
payments semiannually we used the proceeds from these two transactions to
reduce borrowings under our credit facilities to finance acquisitions and
tower construction and for general working capital purposes

  in january 2001 we completed a public offering of 100 million shares of our
class a common stock for total net proceeds of approximately 3608 million we
also completed a private placement of 10 billion of 9 38 senior notes that
mature in february 2009 for total net proceeds of 9690 million these notes
require interest payments semiannually and contain certain financial and
operational covenants and other restrictions similar to those in our credit
facilities we expect to use the proceeds from these two transactions to
finance the construction of towers fund pending and future acquisitions and
for general corporate purposes

  atc separation we continue to be obligated under the atc separation
agreement for certain tax liabilities to cbs and american radio as of december
31 2000 no material matters covered under this indemnification have been
brought to our attention

  acquisitions and construction we expect that the consummated acquisitions
and current and future construction activities will have a material impact on
liquidity we believe that the acquisitions once integrated will have a
favorable impact on liquidity and will offset the initial effects of the
funding requirements we also believe that the construction activities may
initially have an adverse effect on our future liquidity as newly constructed
towers will initially decrease overall liquidity however as such sites become
fully operational and achieve higher utilization we expect that they will
generate tower cash flow and in the longterm increase liquidity as of
december 31 2000 we were a party to various agreements relating to
acquisitions of assets or businesses from various third parties and were
involved in the construction of numerous towers pursuant to buildtosuit
agreements and for other purposes

  economic conditions a significant general slow down in the economy in 2001
or beyond could reduce consumer demand for wireless services thereby causing
providers to delay implementation of new systems and technologies and has
harmed and may continue to harm the financial condition of some wireless
service providers as referred to elsewhere herein

recent accounting pronouncements

  on january 1 2001 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities this statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments specifically it
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in
the fair value of a derivative that is unrealized gains or losses will be
recorded as a component of an entitys net income or other comprehensive
income depending upon designation as defined in the statement as a result
of adopting sfas no 133 we expect to record a pretax noncash loss from a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of approximately 120
million to 140 million in the first quarter of 2001

  during 2000 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff
accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition which provides the
sec staffs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to
revenue recognition sab no 101 was effective for the company on october 1
2000 the adoption of sab no 101 was not material to our consolidated
financial statements

  in march 2000 the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation
no 44 fin 44 accounting for certain transactions involving stock
compensation an interpretation of apb no 25 fin 44 was effective july 1
2000 the adoption of fin 44 was not material to our consolidated financial

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

  as of and for the years ended december 31 2000 and 1999 we were exposed to
market risk from changes in interest rates on longterm debt obligations we
attempted to reduce those risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments
namely interest rate caps swaps collars and swaptions all derivative
financial instruments are for purposes other than trading

  during 2000 we increased our borrowings under our credit facilities by
approximately 126 billion in addition we completed a private placement of
4500 million of 50 convertible notes issued at 100 of their face amount
we also entered into several interest rate cap swap collar and swaption
agreements to reduce our risk with respect to the variable rate debt under our
credit facilities lastly during 2000 we had interest rate caps with a total
notional amount of 669 million expire

  the following tables provide information as of december 31 2000 and 1999
about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates for
longterm debt obligations the tables present principal cash flows by maturity
date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations for
interest rate caps swaps collars and swaptions the tables present notional
principal amounts and weightedaverage interest rates by contractual maturity

                   notes to consolidated financial statements

1 business and summary of significant accounting policies

business and corporate structureamerican tower corporation and subsidiaries
collectively atc or the company is an independent owner operator and
developer of broadcast and wireless communications sites in north america and
mexico the companys primary businesses are the leasing of antenna space to a
diverse range of wireless communications and broadcast industries providing
network development services and components to wireless service providers and
broadcasters and providing satellite and fiber network access services to
telecommunication companies internet service providers broadcasters and
maritime customers worldwide the company was a whollyowned subsidiary of
american radio systems corporation ars american radio or the former parent
until consummation of the spinoff of the company from american radio on june
4 1998 the atc separation

atc separationon june 4 1998 the merger of american radio and a subsidiary
of cbs corporation cbs was consummated as a result of the merger all of the
outstanding shares of the companys common stock owned by american radio were
distributed to american radio common stockholders and the company ceased to be
a subsidiary of or to be otherwise affiliated with american radio
furthermore from that day forward the company began operating as an
independent publicly traded company

as part of the atc separation the company was required to reimburse cbs for
certain tax liabilities incurred by american radio as a result of the
transaction upon completion of the final american radio tax filings a
calculation of the total tax payments due to cbs was performed and approved by
both the company and cbs the company continues to be obligated to indemnify
cbs and american radio for certain tax matters affecting american radio prior
to the atc separation as of december 31 2000 no material matters covered
under this indemnification have been brought to the companys attention

principles of consolidation and basis of presentationthe accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its
subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated investments in those entities where the company owns less than
twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and does not
exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the
entity are accounted for using the cost method investments in entities where
the company owns less than twenty percent but has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or
where the company owns more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the
individual entity but not in excess of fifty percent are accounted for using
the equity method the company consolidates those entities in which it owns
greater than fifty percent of the entitys voting stock

for the period from january 1 1998 to june 4 1998 the company effectively
operated as a standalone entity with its own corporate staff and
headquarters and received minimal assistance from personnel of american radio
accordingly the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the period
discussed above do not include any corporate general and administrative cost
allocations from american radio the consolidated financial statements may not
reflect the results of operations or financial position of the company had it
been an independent public company during the periods presented prior to june
4 1998

use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes actual results may differ from those estimates and
such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements

revenue recognitionrental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly
basis under lease or management agreements when earned escalation clauses
excluding those tied to the consumer price index cpi and other incentives
present in lease agreements with the companys customers are recognized on a
straightline basis over the term of the lease amounts billed or received
prior to being earned are deferred until such time as the earnings process is
complete

income taxesthe consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for
federal state local and foreign income taxes however the tax costs of
repatriating foreign subsidiary business earnings to the companys domestic
subsidiaries have not been reflected in the tax provision as the company
intends to permanently reinvest the profits of its foreign subsidiaries within
those entities

the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the company
measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date the company provides
valuation allowances if based on the weight of available evidence it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized see note 9

loss per common sharebasic and diluted income or loss per common share has
been computed by dividing the companys net loss by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted per share
amounts are computed by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares
for dilutive potential common shares during the period if any in computing
diluted per share amounts the company uses the treasury stock method whereby
unexercised options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning
of the period or at issuance if later the assumed proceeds are then used
to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period for
the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 dilutive potential common
shares including options warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of the
companys convertible notes have been excluded from the computation of
diluted loss per common share as the effect is antidilutive had these
dilutive potential common shares been included in the computation shares for
the diluted computation would have increased by approximately 398 million
115 million and 39 million for the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and
1998 respectively

for purposes of calculating earnings per share for the year ended december 31
1998 shares outstanding upon consummation of the atc separation are assumed
to be outstanding for the entire period prior to june 4 1998

impairment of longlived assetsthe company reviews longterm assets
including identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable the company assesses recoverability by determining whether the
net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected
undiscounted future cash flows the company records any related impairment
losses in the period in which it identifies such impairment

employees officers and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed
