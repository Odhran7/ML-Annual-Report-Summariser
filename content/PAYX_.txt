our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results thirdparties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason including internet or systems failure or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption hardware applications and services including cloudbased services that we develop or procure from thirdparty vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services any delays or failures caused by network outages software or hardware failures or other data processing disruptions could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all the speed to closure of significant cyber security incidents may be influenced by the cooperation of governmental or law enforcement agencies we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or act of war public health emergency pandemic or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations climaterelated weather disasters including hurricanes flooding snowstorms and severe rainstorms could also threaten the business continuity of our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods snowstorms and rain storms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees and information technology vendors servicing cloudbased platforms we use failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

 

 

 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business 

many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship within our peo business state and federal positions regarding coemployment relationships are in a constant state of flux and changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations we cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws incurring additional liabilities related to our peo business may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends 

within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms if at all also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

 

we made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations successful integration involves many challenges including the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the loss of key employees of an acquired business the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process in addition an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows andor operating results and dilute stockholder interests for many reasons including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders if the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 

 

financial risks 

 

our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf resulting in financial loss to us 

as part of our payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed resulting in loss to us if a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted 

 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance 

we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

 

 

 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the note purchase and guarantee agreement the “agreement” that we entered into in january 2019 in connection with our acquisition of oasis outsourcing group holdings lp “oasis” contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business these covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries taken as a whole certain merger transactions certain sales of assets and other matters all subject to certain exceptions the agreement also contains financial covenants which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3510 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2010 in addition certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20 of our consolidated stockholders’ equity if we do not comply with these covenants it could result in material adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition 

 

legal regulatory and political risks 

our business services and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies 

many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services employee benefit plan administration services and peo services are designed according to government regulations that often change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue the addition of complex added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business 

 

our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with us and foreign laws and regulations 

our services are subject to various laws and regulations including but not limited to the aca and antimoney laundering rules the growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations modifications of existing laws and regulations or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the areas of payment networks health care reform and retirement plans as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base failure to comply with antimoney laundering laws and regulations which require us to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs and maintain transaction records could result in civil and criminal penalties and adversely impact our business reputation 

in addition there has been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal state local and foreign governments following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic we have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients these regulations may be unclear difficult to interpret or in conflict with other applicable regulations failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

as a us company we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control “ofac” and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide and the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” ofac places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons including most recently to russia belarus and portions of ukraine a violation of a sanction or embargo program or of the fcpa or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials could subject us and individual employees to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations 

 

our reputation results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations 

our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy in the us we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission 

 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification and data privacy laws such as the california consumer protection act in the european union we are subject to the european union’s general data privacy regulation failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we could be subject to litigation or reputational risk if we or our thirdparty providers fail to utilize data practices sufficient to safeguard proprietary confidential or personal or identifying information the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or thirdparties to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks copyrights patents or other means other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property including former employees may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights to the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights with litigation we could incur significant expenses andor be required to pay substantial damages we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or vendors in connection with claims or litigation the litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming 

 

we are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and as such we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees or other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other thirdparties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct and employment and labor law matters the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

general risk factors 

 

our business results of operations and financial condition may continue to be impacted by covid19 and other macroeconomic events and such impact could be materially adverse 

the global spread of covid19 created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of covid19 disrupted economic activity resulting in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending increased unemployment closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses volatility in the global capital markets instability in the credit and financial markets labor shortages regulatory relief for impacted consumers disruption in supply chains and restrictions on many hospitality and travel industry operations inflationary pressure caused in part by the pandemic is ongoing and may be compounded by the russian invasion of ukraine and the resulting impact on commodity prices and supply chains 

 

 

we are subject to the impacts related to the covid19 pandemic and inflationary pressure for so long as our clients are exposed to those heightened risks and uncertainties our business is substantially dependent on our clients’ continued use of our solutions and services and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions if they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection we may not be paid for services we already provided and our client base will shrink which will lower our revenue if under financial pressure our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the services and solutions we provide which would reduce our revenue our clients may decrease their workforce which would decrease their demand for our services because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry we may face pricing pressure on our services and face challenges in onboarding new clients which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations furthermore if the thirdparty service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients our operations could be materially disrupted and we could face significant penalties or liabilities 

 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business further rising inflation may negatively impact our business raise costs and reduce profitability current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 

we invest our funds held for clients in high quality investmentgrade marketable availableforsale “afs” securities money markets and other cash equivalents we also invest our corporate funds in short to intermediateterm instruments funds held for clients and corporate investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility and inflationary pressure the interest we earn on funds held for clients and corporate investments may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest or lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds if we are unable to reinvest our afs securities when they mature our interest income earned and investment portfolio would be reduced if we sell afs securities to satisfy shortterm funding requirements we may recognize losses which would further reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments 

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited in addition our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction 

our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified and diverse personnel at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

in the event we receive negative publicity our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed and clients may not use our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are committed to good corporate citizenship which is reflected in our company culture and core values disclosure of our corporate governance practices including our environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives may draw negative publicity from stakeholders 

 

 

negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us our policies our corporate employees or others associated with us whether or not justified may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand if we are unable to maintain quality hcm and employee benefitrelated solutions and peo and insurance solutions our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish in addition if our brand is negatively impacted it may have a material adverse effect on our business including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and recruiting talent and retaining employees

operating income fiscal 2022 operating income was 18 billion an increase of 26 compared to fiscal 2021 adjusted operating income 1 of 18 billion which excludes the impact of onetime costs reflects an increase of 23 and higher adjusted operating margin 1  operating margin and adjusted operating margin are as follows 

 

  

fluctuations in these metrics were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 237 and 235 for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 respectively the effective income tax rates in both periods were impacted by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to the volume of stock option exercises and the associated employee stockbased compensation payments the current fiscal year effective tax rate was also impacted by the recording of a tax benefit related to prior and current years research and development expenses incurred in the production of customerfacing software  refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income was 14 billion and 11 billion for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively diluted earnings per share was 384 per diluted share for fiscal 2022 and 303 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 refer to note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for information on dilutive shares outstanding 

adjusted net income 1 was 14 billion and 11 billion for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively reflecting an increase of 24 adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 was 377 per diluted share and 304 per diluted share for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively reflecting an increase of 24 

1 adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not us gaap measures refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section below for a discussion of these nongaap measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measure of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share 

 

 

nongaap financial measures adjusted operating income adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda are summarized as follows 

 

  

1 percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers 

2 onetime costs and corresponding tax benefit recognized related to the acceleration of costsaving initiatives including the longterm strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization these events are not expected to recur 

3 net tax windfall benefits related to employee stockbased compensation payments recognized in income taxes this item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price neither of which is within the control of management 

4 nonrecurring tax benefit derived from prior years research and development costs incurred in the production of customerfacing software 

5 the calculation of the impact of nongaap adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently the table may not add down by  001 due to rounding 

in addition to reporting operating income net income and diluted earnings per share which are us gaap measures we present adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are nongaap measures we believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated through the application of us gaap and are not required forms of disclosure by the sec as such they should not be considered a substitute for the us gaap measures of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share and therefore they should not be used in isolation but in 

 

conjunction with the us gaap measures the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the us gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of may 31 2022 remained strong with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments of 13 billion total shortterm and longterm borrowings net of debt issuance costs were 8064 million as of may 31 2022 our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flows from operations were 15 billion for fiscal 2022 our positive cash flows for fiscal 2022 allowed us to support our business and pay dividends of approximately 10 billion we currently anticipate that cash restricted cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2022 along with projected operating cash flows and available shortterm financing will support our business operations capital purchases share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

we believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2022 were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in our assessment 

financing 

shortterm financing we maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations the purpose of these credit facilities is to meet shortterm funding requirements finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes we typically borrow on an overnight or shortterm basis on our credit facilities refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on our credit facilities 

details of our credit facilities are as follows 

 

  

amounts outstanding under the pnc credit facility as of may 31 2022 remain outstanding as of the date of this report 

details of borrowings under each credit facility during the fiscal years ended 2022 and 2021 were as follows 

 

  

  

 

 

shortterm borrowings are primarily used for the settlement of client fund obligations rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have been invested in afs securities allocated to our longterm portfolio 

we expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities to meet our ongoing financial needs however if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in but not limited to item 1a in this form 10k and other sec filings we may need to adjust our capital operating and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us furthermore if we determine the need for additional shortterm liquidity there is no assurance that such financing if pursued and obtained would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us 

letters of credit as of may 31 2022 we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling 1402 million required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between june 8 2022 and may 26 2023 no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 or as of may 31 2022 and may 31 2021 subsequent to may 31 2022 letters of credit expiring on june 8 2022 june 15 2022 june 26 2022 and july 15 2022 were renewed for one year terms 

longterm financing we have borrowed 8000 million through the issuance of longterm private placement debt “senior notes” certain information related to the senior notes is as follows 

 

  

refer to note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on our longterm financing 

other commitments the company has various longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2022 which include 

• operating leases for 1052 million 

• purchase obligations for 1894 million 

• workers’ compensation estimated obligations for 1897 million and 

• longterm senior notes debt obligations for 8000 million plus interest payments of 1842 million 

refer to notes h m and p of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on these areas 

the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 482 million as of may 31 2022 refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability 

we are involved in three limited partnership agreements and committed to contribute a maximum amount of 300 million to venture capital funds in the financial technology sector as of may 31 2022 we have contributed approximately 181 million of the total funding commitment the timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined our investments in venture capital funds are not considered part of our ongoing operations are accounted for under the equity method and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of may 31 2022 

 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and peo employee health and medical benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of may 31 2022 we also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

operating investing and financing cash flow activities 

 

  

the changes in our cash flows for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were primarily the result of the following key drivers 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

• higher net income attributable to the reasons discussed in the “results of operations” section of this item 7 

• changes in income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions and a decrease in income tax payments higher payments in fiscal 2021 resulted from the deferral of payments normally due in fiscal 2020 under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act and normalized in fiscal 2022 and 

• changes in receivables due to funding of temporary staffing clients offset by 

• increase in costs to obtain and fulfill customer contracts as a result of growth in our client base 

• net cash outflow for corporate payroll due to payments of deferred federal payroll taxes and higher incentive compensation payments offset by higher payroll accruals due to the timing of payroll cutoff and 

• increase in net cash outflow for worksite employee compensation 

investing cash flow activities 

 

• the increase in cash used was primarily related to an increase in purchases of vrdns and 

• additional investment in enhancements to our internaluse software 

fluctuations in the net purchases and salesmaturities of afs securities are also due to timing within the client funds portfolio and market conditions specific timing items impacting cash flows for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations amounts will vary based upon the timing of collection from clients and the related remittance to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services 

discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

• increase in net cash outflows from changes in client fund obligations due to the timing of collections and remittances of client funds 

• dividends paid increased 909 million compared to the prior year period due to an increase in our aggregate annual dividends from 252 per share to 277 per share the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and 

• decrease in cash inflows from equitybased plans primarily due to less stock options exercised during fiscal 2022 when compared with fiscal 2021 offset by 

• decrease in cash outflows from repurchases of common shares as we repurchased 12 million shares during fiscal 2022 compared to 17 million during fiscal year 2021 the impact of the repurchased share decrease was partially offset by higher average stock purchase price paid during fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021 

 

the client fund obligations liability will also vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed insurance solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected fees earned for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry via the purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract these fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 46 to 48 days the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients advance payments received for certain of our service offerings for setup fees are considered a material right therefore we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists 

peo solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain passthrough costs billed and incurred which include payroll wages payroll taxes including federal and state unemployment insurance and certain health insurance benefit premiums primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services 

assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained we do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal the company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses including related fringe benefits meet the capitalization criteria under accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 34040 “other assets and deferred costs contracts with customers” “asc 34040” we also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered we determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under asc 34040 these capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations 

the assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eightyear life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship we regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended may 31 2022 or may 31 2021 

 

peo insurance reserves as part of our peo solution we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits these reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims in establishing the peo workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims the determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions the estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends each reporting period changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where we retain risk a reserve for insurance arrangements where we retain risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability includes estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and independent actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2022 or 2021 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter during fiscal 2022 a qualitative assessment was performed for our paychex inc excluding purchased receivables reporting unit and a quantitative assessment was performed on the purchased receivable reporting unit to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below their carrying value a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2021 the qualitative assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2022 or 2021 subsequent to the latest review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company’s goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2022 or 2021 as a result of the qualitative analyses performed 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease rightofuse “rou” assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for fiscal 2022 or as of may 31 2022 

 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model we will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period 

we estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of the exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and afs securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of afs securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm afs securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of aa or higher and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds corporate bonds us government agency securities and vrdns we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the afs securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2022 our primary shortterm investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and vrdns we have no exposure to highrisk or nonliquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2022 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios was 11 compared to 12 for fiscal 2021 when interest rates are rising the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a rising interest rate environment earnings will increase from our shortterm investments and over time will increase from our longerterm afs securities earnings from the afs securities which as of may 31 2022 had an average duration of 32 years would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of afs securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2022 are shown below by expected maturity 

 

  

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

as of may 31 2022 and 2021 the federal funds rate was in the range of 075 to 100 and in the range of 000 to 025 respectively effective june 16 2022 the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate 075 to a range of 150 to 175 there continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the federal reserve and other government agencies related to the concerns over inflation risk we will continue to monitor market conditions 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

• governmental action to address inflation 

• daily interest rate changes 

• seasonal variations in investment balances 

 

• actual duration of shortterm and afs securities 

• the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

• changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

• financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 45 million to 50 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments averaged approximately 57 billion for fiscal 2022 our anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected net unrealized losses of 1363 million and net unrealized gains of 793 million as of may 31 2022 and 2021 respectively refer to note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2022 the net unrealized loss or gain on our investment portfolios ranged from a 1563 million net unrealized loss to a 892 million net unrealized gain during fiscal 2021 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 627 million to 1219 million the net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios was approximately 1537 million as of july 13 2022 

as of may 31 2022 and 2021 we had 40 billion and 30 billion respectively invested in afs securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 19 as of may 31 2022 and 2021 the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes afs securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of afs securities as of may 31 2022 would be in the range of 200 million to 250 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on our results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns and we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2022 were not impaired as a result of the previously discussed reasons while 23 billion of our afs securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the gross unrealized losses of 1390 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns most of the afs securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2022 and 2021 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns could change in the future due to new developments including changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

 

we have some credit risk exposure relating to the purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry there is also credit risk exposure relating to the company’s trade accounts receivable these credit risk exposures are diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

data security and privacy leaks  we collect use and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients employees of our clients and our employees including bank account  credit card  and social security numbers tax return information health care information retirement account information payroll information system and network passwords and other sensitive personal and business information at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile cyber and ransomware attacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security we may be particularly targeted for cyberattack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect use and retain vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data furthermore if any of our products contains a software vulnerability the vulnerability may be exploited to obtain access to our data or our clients’ data 

our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise s or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results thirdparties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason including internet or systems failure or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption hardware  applications and services including cloudbased services that we develop or procure from thirdparty vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services any delays or failures caused by network outages software or hardware failures or other data processing disruptions could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations 

our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack public health emergency pandemic or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations climaterelated weather disasters including hurricanes flooding snowstorms and severe rainstorms could also threaten the business continuity of our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods snowstorms and rain storms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions 

as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks  banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees  and information technology vendors servicing cloudbased platforms we use  failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business 

many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship within our peo business state and federal positions regarding coemployment relationships are in a constant state of flux and changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations we cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws incurring additional liabilities related to our peo business may adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends 

within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

we made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations successful integration involves many challenges including the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the loss of key employees of an acquired business the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process in addition an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows andor operating results and dilute stockholder interests for many reasons including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders if the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 

financial risks 

our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf resulting in financial loss to us 

as part of our payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed resulting in loss to us if a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance 

we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the note purchase and guarantee agreement the “agreement” that we entered into in january 2019 in connection with our acquisition of oasis outsourcing group holdings lp “oasis”  contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business these covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries taken as a whole certain merger transactions certain sales 

of assets and other matters all subject to certain exceptions the agreement also contains financial covenants which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 3510 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2010 in addition certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20 of our consolidated stockholders’ equity if we do not comply with these covenants it could result in material adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition 

legal regulatory and political risks 

our business services and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies 

many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that often change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business 

our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with us and foreign laws and regulations 

our services are subject to various laws and regulations including but not limited to the aca and antimoney laundering rules the growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations modifications of existing laws and regulations or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base failure to comply with antimoney laundering laws and regulations which require us to develop and implement riskbased antimoney laundering programs and maintain transaction records could result in civil and criminal penalties and adversely impact our business reputation 

in addition there has been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal state local and foreign governments following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic we have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients these regulations may be unclear difficult to interpret or in conflict with other applicable regulations failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

a s a us company we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide and the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” a violation of a sanction or embargo program or of the fcpa or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials could subject us and individual employees to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations 

our reputation results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations 

our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy in the us we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification and data privacy laws such as the california consumer protection act in the european union  we are subject to the european union’s general data privacy regulation failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we could be subject to litigation or reputational risk if we or our thirdparty providers fail to utilize data practices sufficient to safeguard proprietary confidential or personal or identifying information the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or thirdparties to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks copyrights patents or other means other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property including former employees may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights to the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights with litigation we could incur significant expenses andor be required to pay substantial damages we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or vendors in connection with claims or litigation the litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming 

we are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and as such we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees or other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other thirdparties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct and employment and labor law matters the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general risk factors 

our business  results of operations  and financial condition may continue to be impacted by the outbreak of covid19 and such impact could be materially adverse 

the global spread of covid19 created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption the restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of covid19 disrupted economic activity resulting in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending increased unemployment closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses volatility in the global capital markets instability in the credit and financial markets labor shortages regulatory relief for impacted consumers disruption in supply chains and restrictions on many hospitality and travel industry operations while economic conditions have begun improving as vaccine distribution has accelerated in the united states there can be no assurance that the economic recovery will occur or offset the uncertainty and instability triggered by the pandemic 

we are subject to the impacts related to the covid19 pandemic for so long as our clients are exposed to those heightened risks and uncertainties our business is substantially dependent on our clients ’ continued use of our solutions and services and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions if they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection we may not be paid for services we already provided and our client base will shrink which will lower our revenue if under financial pressure our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the services and solutions we provide which would reduce our revenue our clients may decrease their workforce which would decrease their demand for our services because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry we may face pricing pressure on our services and face challenges in onboarding new clients which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations furthermore if the thirdparty service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients our operations could be materially disrupted and we could face significant penalties or liabilities 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment 

trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 

we invest our funds held for clients in high quality investmentgrade marketable availableforsale “afs” securities money markets and other cash equivalents we also invest our corporate funds in short to intermediateterm instruments funds held for clients and corporate investments are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility the interest we earn on funds held for clients and corporate investments may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods 

of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds if we are unable to reinvest our afs securities when they mature our interest income earned and investment portfolio would be reduced if we sell afs securities to satisfy shortterm funding requirements we may recognize losses which would further reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments  

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited in addition our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction 

our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified people at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

in the event we receive negative publicity our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed and clients may not use our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business 

negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us our corporate employees or others associated with us whether or not justified may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand if we are unable to maintain quality hcm and employee benefitrelated solutions and peo and insurance solutions our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish in addition if our brand is negatively impacted it may have a material adverse effect on our business including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and recruiting talent and retaining employees

nm – not meaningful 

the changes in revenue as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the following factors 

 management solutions revenue 30 billion for fiscal 2021 reflecting an increase of 2 

o payroll client base growth of approximately 4 due to solid sales performance and record client retention and 

‎ 

o increased penetration of our suite of solutions including hr solutions retirement services and time and attendance and growth in ancillary products and services due to higher transaction volumes offset by 

o decline in check volumes experienced during the first three quarters of our fiscal year from an overall reduction in the number of clients processing payrolls due to lower employment levels during the pandemic 

 peo and insurance solutions revenue 9741 million for fiscal 2021 reflecting a decrease of 2 

o decrease in the number of worksite employees at our clients in the first three quarters offset by growth in the fourth quarter and

o increase in the number of health and benefit clients 

 interest on funds held for clients 593 million for fiscal 2021 reflecting a decrease of 32 

o lower average interest rates due to historically low federal funds rates and 

o lower realized gains which primarily resulted from our decision to strategically reposition our client fund portfolio at the end of fiscal 2020 to enhance liquidity in response to the economic uncertainties caused by covid19 

o average investment balances were consistent 

we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2021 we had no exposure to highrisk or nonliquid investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios are as follows 





1 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 774 million as of july 14 2021

total expenses the following table summarizes total combined cost of service revenue and selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 



1 percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers 

the changes in total expenses as compared to the prior year period were primarily driven by the following factors 

 compensationrelated expenses 15 billion for fiscal 2021 reflecting a 3 increase 

o higher performancebased compensation due to stronger than anticipated performance in fiscal 2021 and unusually low performancebased compensation in 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic offset by

 other expenses 4980 million in fiscal 2021 reflecting a 10 decrease 

o lower discretionary and facilities spend due to office closures and restrictions due to the pandemic 

operating income fiscal 2021 operating income was 15 billion and comparable to fiscal 2020 adjusted operating income 1 of 15 billion which excludes the impact of onetime costs reflects an increase of 2 and higher adjusted operating margin 1  operating margin and adjusted operating margin are as follows 



fluctuations in these metrics were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 235 and 236 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively the effective income tax rates in both periods were impacted by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to the volume of stock option exercises and the associated employee stockbased compensation payments refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and diluted earnings per share   net income was 11 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share was 303 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 and 304 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 refer to note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for information on dilutive shares outstanding 

adjusted net income 1 was 11 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 reflecting an increase of 2 adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 was 304 per diluted share and 300 per diluted share for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively reflecting an increase of 1 

1 adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not us gaap measures refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section below for a discussion of these nongaap measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measure of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share

nongaap financial measures a djusted operating income adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda are summarized as follows 



1 percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers 

2 onetime costs and corresponding tax benefit recognized related to the acceleration of costsaving initiatives including the longterm strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization these events are not expected to recur 

3 net tax windfall benefits related to employee stockbased compensation payments recognized in income taxes this item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price neither of which is within the control of management 

4 the calculation of the impact of nongaap adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently the table may not add down by  001 due to rounding 

in addition to reporting operating income net income and diluted earnings per share which are us gaap measures we present adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” and adjusted ebitda which are nongaap measures we believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated through the application of us gaap and are not required forms of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such they should not be considered a substitute for the us gaap measures of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share and therefore they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the us gaap measures the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the us gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of may 31 2021 remained strong with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments of 11 billion total shortterm and longterm borrowings net of debt issuance costs were 8047 million as of may 31 2021 our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations cash flows from operations were 13 billion for fiscal 2021 our positive cash flows for fiscal 2021 allowed us to support our business and pay dividends of approximately 9090 million we currently anticipate that cash restricted cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2021 along with projected operating cash flows and available shortterm financing will support our business operations capital purchases share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

we believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2021 were not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any change in our assessment 

financing 

shortterm financing we maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations the purpose of these credit facilities is to meet shortterm funding requirements finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes we typically borrow on an overnight or shortterm basis on our credit facilities refer to note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on our credit facilities 

details of our credit facilities are as follows 



amounts outstanding under the pnc credit facility as of may 31 2021 remain outstanding as of the date of this report 

details of borrowings under each credit facility during the fiscal years ended 2021 and 2020 were as follows 





shortterm borrowings are primarily used for the settlement of client fund obligations rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have been invested in afs securities allocated to our longterm portfolio 

we expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities to meet our ongoing financial needs however if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in but not limited to item 1a in this form 10k and other sec filings we may need to adjust our capital operating and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us furthermore if we determined the need for additional shortterm liquidity there is no assurance that such financing if pursued and obtained would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us 

letters of credit as of may 31 2021 we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling 1804 million required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between june 2021 and july 2022 no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2021 or as of may 31 2021 subsequent to may 31 2021 letters of credit expiring in june 2021 were renewed through june 2022  

longterm financing we have borrowed 8000 million through the issuance of longterm private placement debt “senior notes” certain information related to the senior notes are as follows 



refer to note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on our longterm financing 

other commitments the company has various longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2021 which include 

 operating leases for 1274 million 

 purchase obligations for 1627 million 

 workers’ compensation estimated obligations for 1831 million and 

 longterm senior notes debt obligations for 8000 million plus interest payments of 2175 million 

refer to notes i n and q of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on these areas   

the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 204 million as of may 31 2021 refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability 

we are involved in two limited partnership agreements and committed to contribute a maximum amount of 200 million to venture capital funds in the financial technology sector as of may 31 2021 we have contributed approximately 120 million of the total funding commitment the timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined our investments in venture capital funds are not considered part of our ongoing operations are accounted for under the equity method and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of may 31 2021 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and peo employee health and medical benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and were not material as of may 31 2021 we also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

operating investing and financing cash flow activities 



the changes in our cash flows for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were primarily the result of the following key drivers 

operating cash flow activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 1806 million 

 increases in purchased receivable balances in fiscal 2021 due to our clients’ continued recovery from the covid19 pandemic and growth in our business and 

 timing of estimated income tax payments payments normally due in fiscal 2020 were deferred until fiscal 2021 under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act offset by   

 increases in accrued worksite employee compensation as peo clients’ employees returned to work and 

 increases in accrued corporate compensation due to higher performancebased compensation in fiscal 2021 

investing cash flow activities 

cash used in investing activities increased 12 billion 

 increases in client fund assets as clients continue to recover from the covid19 pandemic 

 at the end of fiscal 2020 we increased our liquidity by selling afs securities due to the uncertainties of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the market and our business as economic conditions improved throughout fiscal 2021 we started to opportunistically reposition back into afs securities and 

 reduced availability of targeted high quality vrdns in the market led to fewer afs securities held and more cash equivalent balances during fiscal 2021 

fluctuations in the net purchases and salesmaturities of afs securities are also due to timing within the client funds portfolio and market conditions specific timing items impacting cash flows for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations amounts will vary based upon the timing of collection from clients and the related remittance to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services 

discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

financing cash flow activities 

cash used in financing activities decreased 8518 million 

 increases in client fund obligations in fiscal 2021 was due to our clients’ continued recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the timing of the federal holiday funds collected on friday may 28 2021 were not remitted to client employees or tax and regulatory agencies until june 2021 

 cash flows from equitybased plans increased largely due to higher proceeds from the exercise or vesting of stock awards 27 million shares of our common stock were exercised or vested in fiscal 2021 compared to 15 million shares in fiscal 2020 

 during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we repurchased 17 million shares and 20 million shares respectively as of may 31 2021 724 million remains available under the common stock repurchase program refer to market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities contained in item 5 of this form 10k for further discussion on our common stock repurchase programs and 

 dividend payments increased in fiscal 2021 due to a 6 increase in our dividend rate beginning in may 2021 the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flows and is subject to the discretion of our board 

the client fund obligations liability will also vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days

critical accounting policies and estimates 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed insurance solutions revenues are recognized when commissions are earned on premiums billed and collected fees earned for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry via the purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract these fees are then recognized over the average collection period of 35 to 45 days the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for the delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients advance payments received for certain of our service offerings for setup fees are considered a material right therefore we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the material right exists 

peo solutions revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain passthrough costs billed and incurred which include payroll wages payroll taxes including federal and state unemployment insurance and certain health insurance benefit premiums primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services 

assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained we do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal the company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses including related fringe benefits meet the capitalization criteria under accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 34040 “other assets and deferred costs contracts with customers” “asc 34040” we also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered we determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under asc 34040 these capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations 

the assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eightyear life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship we regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended may 31 2021 or may 31 2020 

  peo insurance reserves as part of our peo solution we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits these reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims in establishing the peo workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims the determination of estimated ultimate losses by our independent actuary are based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions the estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon loss development factors and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends each reporting period changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans or fully insured insurance arrangements where we retain risk a reserve for insurance arrangements where we retain risk is established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability includes estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and independent actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for fiscal 2021 or 2020 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2021 and 2020 to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value the qualitative assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2021 or 2020 subsequent to the latest review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company’s goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2021 or 2020 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease rightofuse assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for fiscal 2021 or 2020 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model we will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period 

we estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of the exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and afs securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of afs securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm afs securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of aa or higher and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds – including general obligation bonds and revenue bonds us government agency and treasury securities and corporate bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the afs securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2021 our primary shortterm investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and vrdns we have no exposure to highrisk or nonliquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2021 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investment portfolios was 12 compared to 18 for fiscal 2020 when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment earnings decrease from our shortterm investments and over time earnings will decrease from our longerterm afs securities earnings from the afs securities which as of may 31 2021 had an average duration of 33 years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of afs securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2021 are shown below by expected maturity 



vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate a total of 225 basis points during fiscal 2020 of which 150 basis points was in response to the covid19 pandemic as of may 31 2021 and may 31 2020 the federal funds rate was in the range of 000 to 025 there continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the federal reserve and other government agencies related to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to monitor market conditions 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 governmental action resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

 daily interest rate changes 

 seasonal variations in investment balances 

 actual duration of shortterm and afs securities 

 the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

‎ 

 changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

 financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 30 million to 35 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments averaged approximately 50 billion for fiscal 2021 our anticipated allocation is approximately 40 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 60 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected net unrealized gains of 793 million and 1000 million as of may 31 2021 and may 31 2020 respectively refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2021 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 627 million to 1219 million during fiscal 2020 the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of 1063 million to an unrealized loss of 270 million the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 774 million as of july 14 2021 

as of may 31 2021 and 2020 we had 30 billion and 28 billion respectively invested in afs securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 19 as of may 31 2021 and 21 as of may 31 2020 the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes afs securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of afs securities as of may 31 2021 would be approximately 250 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on our results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns and we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2021 were not impaired as a result of the previously discussed reasons while 4199 million of our afs securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the gross unrealized losses of 40 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns most of the afs securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2021 and 2020 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not impaired due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns could change in the future due to new developments including changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

we have some credit risk exposure relating to the purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry there is also credit risk exposure relating to the company’s trade accounts receivable these credit risk exposures are diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new worksite employees associated with our hr solutions aso and peo businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses clients requesting additional yearend services and the preparation and delivery of endof year reporting requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the following risk factors represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business these are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition refer to the cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our business and results of operations have been and our financial condition may be impacted by the outbreak of covid19 and such impact could be materially adverse the global spread of covid19 created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption in the united states and globally governmental authorities instituted certain preventative measures including border closures travel restrictions operational restrictions on certain businesses shelterinplace orders quarantines and recommendations to practice social distancing these restrictions disrupted and may continue to disrupt economic activity resulting in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending increased unemployment closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses volatility in the global capital markets instability in the credit and financial markets labor shortages regulatory recommendations to provide relief for impacted consumers disruption in supply chains and restrictions on many hospitality and travel industry operations 

the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business operations and financial results is uncertain and will depend on future developments including the duration or recurrence of the pandemic the related length and severity of its impact on the us and global economy and the continued governmental business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and economic disruption impacts related to the covid19 pandemic are expected to continue to pose risks to our business for the foreseeable future heightened many of the risks and uncertainties identified below and could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is substantially dependent on our clients continued use of our solutions and services and our results of operations will decline if our clients are no longer willing or able to use them our clients are sensitive to negative changes in economic conditions if they cease operations or file for bankruptcy protection we may not be paid for services we already provided and our client base will shrink which will lower our revenue if under financial pressure our clients may determine that they are no longer willing to pay for the services and solutions we provide which would reduce our revenue our clients may decrease their workforce which would decrease their demand for our services because of spending constraints on our clients and competition in the industry we may face pricing pressure on our services and face challenges in onboarding new clients which would reduce revenue and ultimately impact our results of operations if the thirdparty service providers we rely on are unable to perform their services for us and our clients our operations could be materially disrupted and we could face significant penalties or liabilities 

our operational risk including data security risk has increased during the pandemic as a majority of our employees are working remotely and cybercriminal activity increases in an attempt to profit from the disruption to typical operations 

there has been and may continue to be a significant number of new laws and regulations promulgated by federal state local and foreign governments following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic we have expended additional resources and incurred additional costs in addressing regulatory requirements applicable to us and our clients these regulations may be unclear difficult to interpret or in conflict with other applicable regulations the failure to comply with these new laws and regulations could result in financial penalties legal proceedings and reputational harm 

our business services and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies  many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that often change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business 

our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with us and foreign laws and regulations  our services are subject to various laws and regulations including but not limited to the aca and antimoney laundering rules the growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations modifications of existing laws and regulations or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition in addition as a us company we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide and the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” a violation of a sanction or embargo program or of the fcpa or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials could subject us and individual employees to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services  the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changing industry standards to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality time to market cost and innovation relative to our competitors the failure to provide more efficient and userfriendly customerfacing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations the failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools natural language processing and artificial intelligencemachine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities 

we could be subject to reduced revenues increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks security vulnerabilities or internet disruptions we rely upon information technology “it” networks cloudbased platforms and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes some of which are provided by thirdparty vendors cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation a cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption or outage corruption of data or theft of personal or other sensitive information could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients result in liability or regulatory sanction or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business the rapid speed of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks security vulnerabilities and internet disruptions enabled by new and emerging technologies may outpace our organizations ability to compete andor manage the risk appropriately in addition cybercriminals may seek to exploit the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic by attempting to engage in paymentrelated fraud or by more frequently attempting to gain access to our systems through phishing or other means that may be more successful when most of our employees are working remotely 

data security and privacy leaks  we collect use and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients employees of our clients and our employees including bank account numbers credit card numbers social security numbers tax return information health care information retirement account information payroll information system and network passwords and other sensitive personal and business information at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile cyberattacks and data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security we may be particularly targeted for cyberattack because of the amount and type of personal and business information that we collect use and retain vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data 

our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results thirdparties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption  if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason including internet or systems failure or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption hardware applications and services including cloudbased services that we develop or procure from thirdparty vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services any delays or failures caused by network outages software or hardware failures or other data processing disruptions could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our reputation results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy in the us we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification and data privacy laws such as the california consumer protection act which became effective on january 1 2020 in addition the european union’s general data privacy regulation became fully effective in may 2018 failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack public health emergency or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship within our peo business state and federal positions regarding coemployment relationships are in a constant state of flux and changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations we cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws incurring additional liabilities related to our peo business may adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we made on their behalf resulting in financial loss to us as part of our payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed resulting in loss to us if a significant number of our clients are unable to cover payments we make on their behalf our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 

we invest our funds held for clients in high quality investmentgrade marketable securities money markets and other cash equivalents however these funds held for clients are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds if we sell availableforsale securities to satisfy shortterm funding requirements we may recognize losses which would reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients 

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited in addition our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations successful integration involves many challenges including the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the loss of key employees of an acquired business the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process in addition an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows andor operating results and dilute stockholder interests for many reasons including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders if the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price 

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  the note purchase and guarantee agreement the “agreement” that we entered into in january 2019 in connection with our acquisition of oasis contains covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business these covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries taken as a whole certain merger transactions certain sales of assets and other matters all subject to certain exceptions the agreement also contains financial covenants which are reviewed for compliance on a quarterly basis that require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 350100 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 200100 in addition certain of our indebtedness may not exceed 20 of our consolidated stockholders’ equity if we do not comply with these covenants it could result in material adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified people at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or thirdparties to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks copyrights patents or other means other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property including former employees may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete thirdparties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights to the extent we seek to enforce or must defend our intellectual property rights with litigation we could incur significant expenses andor be required to pay substantial damages we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or vendors in connection with claims or litigation the litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could be costly and timeconsuming 

in the event we receive negative publicity our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed and clients may not use our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us our corporate employees or others associated with us whether or not justified may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand if we are unable to maintain quality hcm and employee benefitrelated solutions and peo and insurance solutions our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish in addition if our brand is negatively impacted it may have a material adverse effect on our business including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and recruiting talent and retaining employees 

we are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and as such we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees or other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other thirdparties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct and employment and labor law matters the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

as our clients continue to manage through the covid19 pandemic our priority remains helping them keep their businesses open and return to more normal operations our blend of technology and service provides valuable tools and resources to assist our clients and their employees during this critical time the technology investments we made to our paychex flex payroll and human resources suite of products positioned us to service our clients and support them in managing a remote workforce

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients increased 8 for fiscal 2020 and 27 for fiscal 2019 to 869 million and 806 million respectively for fiscal 2020 the increase was due to higher realized gains offset by lower average investment balances and average interest rates the realized gains primarily resulted from the strategic repositioning of our client fund portfolio to enhance liquidity in response to the uncertainty caused by covid19 for fiscal 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned 

average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1 and 2 for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively for fiscal 2020 funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by lower client fund collections due to covid19 and changes in client base mix offset by wage inflation and timing of collections and remittances for fiscal 2019 the decrease in average investment balances for funds held for clients was primarily driven by the impact of lower client withholdings as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” and changes in client base mix partially offset by the impact of wage inflation

total expenses total expenses increased 7 and 15 for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively compared to the prior fiscal year periods the following table summarizes total combined cost of service revenue and selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 



1 percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers 

compensationrelated expenses increased 6 for fiscal 2020 and 13 for fiscal 2019 for fiscal 2020 the increases in compensationrelated expenses were driven by the acquisition of oasis increased headcount and higher wages offset by a decrease in performancebased pay for fiscal 2019 the increases in compensationrelated expenses were driven by the acquisition of oasis increased headcount higher wages and an increase in performancebased pay as of may 31 2020 we had approximately 15800 employees compared with 15600 employees as of may 31 2019 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and both purchased and internally developed software amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions the growth in depreciation and amortization for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by the amortization of acquired oasis intangible assets 

peo insurance costs include workers’ compensation minimum premium medical insurance plan arrangements and selfinsured dental and vision plans where we retain risk the acquisition of oasis along with the growth in our peo business contributed to the increase in peo insurance costs for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 in addition the acquisition of hr outsourcing holdings inc “ hroi” contributed to the increase in peo insurance costs for fiscal 2019 

other expenses include items such as noncapital equipment delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business other expense growth for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the acquisition of oasis and by continued investment in product development and supporting technology tempered by the impact of covid19 in the fourth quarter which drove decreases in other selling general and administrative expenses including travel and entertainment the increase in other expenses for fiscal 2019 was impacted by the acquisitions of oasis and hroi and continued investment in product development and supporting technology other expenses for fiscal 2018 included a onetime expense of 326 million related to the termination of certain license agreements 

operating income operating income increased 7 to 15 billion for fiscal 2020 and 6 to 14 billion for fiscal 2019 operating margin operating income as a percentage of total revenue was 361 363 and 382 for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively adjusted operating income 1 increased 7 to 15 billion for fiscal 2020 and 4 to 14 billion for fiscal 2019 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” 1 increased 8 to 17 billion for fiscal 2020 and 9 to 16 billion for fiscal 2019 ebitda margin 1 was 414 412 and 423 for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively  

1 adjusted operating income ebitda and ebitda margin are not us gaap measures refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section within the “results of operations” section of this item 7 for a discussion of these nongaap measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable us gaap measures of operating income and net income 

other expenseincome net other expenseincome net primarily represents interest expense incurred on our debt instruments netted against earnings from our corporate cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities we recognized 234 million and 33 million of other expense net in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively which was driven by interest expense related to our longterm borrowings other expense net included 333 million and 137 million of interest expense related to our longterm borrowings in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 236 for fiscal 2020 244 for fiscal 2019 and 235 for fiscal 2018 the effective income tax rates in all periods were impacted by recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to employee stockbased compensation payments in fiscal 2019 the effective income tax rate included discrete tax expense for changes in tax reserves and the revaluation of deferred tax balances for legislative updates in fiscal 2018 as a result of the tax act we recorded a nonrecurring net tax benefit for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities this amount impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 023 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and diluted earnings per share   net income increased 6 to 11 billion for fiscal 2020 and 4 to 10 billion for fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share increased 6 to 304 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 and 4 to 286 per diluted share for fiscal 2019 adjusted net income increased 5 to 11 billion for fiscal 2020 and increased 11 to 10 billion for fiscal 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 300 per diluted share for fiscal 2020 and 284 per diluted share for fiscal 2019 reflecting increases of 6 and 11 respectively refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section that follows for a discussion of these nongaap measures 

‎ 

nongaap financial measures a djusted operating income adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share and ebitda are summarized as follows 



1 additional expense and corresponding tax benefit recognized as a result of the termination of certain license agreements this event is not expected to recur 

2 net tax windfall benefits related to employee stockbased compensation payments recognized in income taxes this item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price neither of which is within the control of management 

3 for fiscal 2019 this line item represents a onetime tax charge that was recognized during the three months ended august 31 2018 as a result of updated guidance on internal revenue code section 162m this event is not expected to recur for fiscal 2018 this line item represents nonrecurring tax benefits recognized as a result of the tax act related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities 

in addition to reporting operating income net income and diluted earnings per share which are us gaap measures we present adjusted operating income adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share ebitda and ebitda margin ebitda as a percentage of total revenue which are nongaap measures we believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations’ performance period over period adjusted operating income adjusted net income adjusted diluted earnings per share ebitda and ebitda margin are not calculated through the application of us gaap and are not required forms of disclosure by the sec as such they should not be considered as a substitute for the us gaap measures of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the us gaap measures the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the us gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of may 31 2020 remained strong with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments of 10 billion total shortterm and longterm borrowings net of debt issuance costs were 8019 million as of may 31 2020 our primary source of cash is generated by our ongoing operations cash flows from operations were 14 billion for fiscal 2020 our positive cash flows for fiscal 2020 allowed us to support our business and pay substantial dividends we currently anticipate that cash restricted cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2020 along with projected operating cash flows and available shortterm financing will support our business operations capital purchases share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

we believe that our investments in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2020 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any otherthantemporary impairment 

financing 

shortterm financing we maintain committed and unsecured credit facilities and irrevocable letters of credit as part of our normal and recurring business operations the purpose of these credit facilities is to meet shortterm funding requirements finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes we typically borrow on an overnight or shortterm basis on our credit facilities refer to note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on our credit facilities 

details of our credit facilities are as follows 



details of borrowings under each credit facility during the fiscal years ended 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 









shortterm borrowings are primarily used for the settlement of client fund obligations rather than liquidating previouslycollected client funds that have been invested in availableforsale securities allocated to our longterm portfolio 

subsequent to may 31 2020 we borrowed twice on an overnight basis 895 million on a weightedaverage basis under our pnc credit facility 

we expect to have access to the amounts available under our current credit facilities as needed to meet our ongoing financial needs however if we experience reductions in our operating cash flows due to any of the risk factors outlined in but not limited to item 1a in this form 10k and other sec filings including any impacts related to covid19 we may need to adjust our capital operating and other discretionary spending to realign our working capital requirements with the capital resources available to us additionally if we determined the need for additional shortterm liquidity there is no assurance that such financing if pursued and obtained would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us 

letters of credit as of may 31 2020 we had irrevocable standby letters of credit available totaling 1479 million required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between june 2020 and january 2022 no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2020 or as of may 31 2020 subsequent to may 31 2020 letters of credit expiring in june and july 2020 were renewed through june and july 2021 respectively 

longterm financing on march 13 2019 we borrowed 8000 million through the issuance of longterm private placement debt certain information related to the senior notes are as follows

2 purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding commitments under purchase orders to buy goods and services and legally binding contractual arrangements with future payment obligations included in the total purchase obligations is 50 million of commitments to purchase capital assets amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be different due to variable components of these agreements 

3 includes principal and interest payments on our senior notes refer to note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information 

  

the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 265 million as of may 31 2020 refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

we are involved in two limited partnership agreements to contribute a maximum amount of 200 million to venture capital funds in the financial technology sector as of may 31 2020 we have contributed approximately 84 million of the total funding commitment the timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate and peo employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of may 31 2020 we also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

﻿ offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in both lowincome housing projects and venture capital funds focused on the financial technology sector these are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of may 31 2020 

operating investing and financing cash flow activities 



operating cash flow activities 

the changes in our operating cash flows for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year periods were due to higher net income higher noncash adjustments and fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities 

the increase in noncash adjustments for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by larger adjustments for the amortization of intangible assets 

in fiscal 2020 the smaller outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior fiscal year period was due to changes in accounts receivable and peo unbilled receivables which were adversely impacted by covid19 we experienced an increase in the number of nonprocessing clients and a reduction in the number of employees and worksite employees paid as businesses suspended operations due to the pandemic in addition accounts payable and other current liabilities were impacted by a decrease in accrued compensation related to worksite employees and timing of accruals and cash settlement in fiscal 2019 the larger outflow was due to higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients 

investing cash flow activities 

the changes in our investing cash flows for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to prior year periods were primarily attributable to fluctuations in the net purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities changes in net cash outflows related to acquisitions of businesses and purchases of other assets 

fluctuations in the net change in purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio the amount will vary based upon the timing of collection from clients and the related remittance to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations in addition to timing fluctuations the net change in purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to prior year periods were due to changes in investment mix 

the changes in net cash outflows related to acquisition of businesses reflect our acquisitions of oasis in december 2018 lessor group “lessor” in february 2018 and hroi in august 2017 we paid cash for the oasis and lessor acquisitions while we paid a combination of cash and common stock for the hroi acquisition 

the net cash outflow for purchases of other assets during fiscal 2018 was impacted by the resolution of a contractual dispute with certain licensees and the acquisition of rights to certain client lists for approximately 300 million 

discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

financing cash flow activities 

the changes in our financing cash flows for both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to prior fiscal year periods were impacted by net proceeds from longterm borrowings the net change in client fund obligations repurchases of common shares and dividends paid 

in fiscal 2019 we borrowed 8000 million under our jpm credit facilities to fund the acquisition of oasis which was replaced by the issuance of longterm private placement debt in march 2019 refer to note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our longterm financing 

the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days may 31 2020 fell on a sunday and may 31 2019 fell on a friday which is a significant disbursement day for direct pay funds and as such only created minor timing differences in this liability when comparing fiscal 2020 with fiscal 2019 however may 31 2020 balances were impacted by lower client fund collections due to covid19 in contrast may 31 2018 fell on a thursday which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds these funds were then paid out on friday june 1 2018 

the increase in dividend payments for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods is primarily due to an 11 and 12 increase in our dividend rate beginning in may 2019 and april 2018 respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

during fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 we repurchased 20 million shares 07 million shares and 25 million shares respectively as of may 31 2020 2281 million remains available under the common stock repurchase program refer to note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion on our common stock repurchase program

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients’ payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in cost of service revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we receive advance payments for setup fees on some of our service offerings from our clients advance payments received for certain of our service offerings are considered a material right we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the right exists 

peo solutions revenue is reported net of certain direct passthrough costs billed and incurred which include payroll wages payroll taxes including federal and state unemployment insurance and certain health insurance benefit premiums primarily costs related to our guaranteed cost benefit plans direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as cost of service revenue rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services 

assets recognized from the costs to obtain and fulfill contracts we recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization period will be longer than one year incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new contracts and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained we do not incur incremental costs to obtain a contract renewal the company determined that certain sales commissions and bonuses including related fringe benefits meet the capitalization criteria under accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 34040 “other assets and deferred costs contracts with customers” “asc 34040” we also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a client if the costs are specifically identifiable generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered we determined that substantially all costs related to implementation activities are administrative in nature and meet the capitalization criteria under asc 34040 these capitalized costs to fulfill a contract principally relate to upfront direct costs that are expected to be recovered and enhance our ability to satisfy future performance obligations 

the assets related to both costs to obtain and costs to fulfill contracts with clients are capitalized and amortized using an accelerated method over an eightyear life to closely align with the pattern of client attrition over the estimated life of the client relationship we regularly review our deferred costs for potential impairment and did not recognize an impairment loss during the fiscal years ended may 31 2020 or may 31 2019 

  peo insurance reserves as part of the peo solution we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees workers’ compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits these reserves include estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling these claims in establishing the peo workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle claims the evaluation review and determination of estimated ultimate losses by our appointed actuary are based on actuarial methods and assumptions the estimated ultimate losses are primarily based upon estimated loss development factors and other factors such as the nature of employees’ job responsibilities the historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims and an estimate of future cost trends each reporting period changes in actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers’ compensation claims cost estimates 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier in addition we also provide selfinsured dental and vision plans to certain peo clients under the minimum medical premium insurance arrangement and selfinsured dental and vision plans our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability includes estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and independent actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly with workers’ compensation insurance where those payments may not occur until well into the future we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for the fiscal years 2020 2019 or 2018 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value the qualitative assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 subsequent to the latest review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company’s goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances change in a way that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives and operating lease rightofuse assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life volatility is estimated based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model we will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period 

we estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any material change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of the exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of aa or higher and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds – including general obligation bonds and revenue bonds us government agency and treasury securities and corporate bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2020 our primary shortterm investment vehicles were us government agency and treasury securities vrdns and bank demand deposit accounts we have no exposure to highrisk or nonliquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2020 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 18 compared to 19 and 15 for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment earnings decrease from our shortterm investments and over time earnings will decrease from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2020 had an average duration of 29 years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2020 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 



vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate by 25 basis points three times in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 after periodically raising the rate from december 2015 through may 2019 then in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate a total of 150 basis points as of may 31 2020 the federal funds rate was in the range of 00 to 025 as compared to a range of 225 to 250 as of may 31 2019 and in the range of 150 to 175 as of may 31 2018 there continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the federal reserve and other government agencies related to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to monitor market conditions 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 governmental action resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

 daily interest rate changes 

 seasonal variations in investment balances 

 actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale securities 

 the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

 changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

 financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 30 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate cash equivalents and investments averaged approximately 48 billion for fiscal 2020 our anticipated allocation is approximately 40 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 60 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected net unrealized gains of 1000 million and 197 million as of may 31 2020 and may 31 2019 respectively refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2020 the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of 1063 million to an unrealized loss of 270 million during fiscal 2019 the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of 197 million to an unrealized loss of 607 million the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 1124 million as of july 15 2020 

as of may 31 2020 and 2019 we had 28 billion and 36 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 21 as of may 31 2020 and may 31 2019 the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2020 would be in the range of 200 million to 250 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2020 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 668 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that unrealized losses of 17 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns most of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2020 and 2019 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

we have some credit risk exposure relating to the purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry this credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve our internal database source indicates that there are over 10 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve 

the market for hcm services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national international regional local and online service providers in addition to traditional payroll processing and hr service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments payroll and hr systems and software are sold by many vendors our products also compete with a variety of providers of hr services such as retirement services companies insurance companies hr and benefits consulting firms and national and regional peos 

competition in the payroll processing and hr services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offerings and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas we believe that our leadingedge technology and mobility applications combined with personalized service provided by industry professionals distinguishes us from our competitors 

software maintenance and development

employees 

we believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is important to our future success and growth as of may 31 2019 we employed approximately 15600 people of which approximately 15300 people were employed on a fulltime basis none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new worksite employees associated with our hr solutions aso and peo businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses clients requesting additional yearend services and the preparation and delivery of endof year reporting requirements

 item 1 a  risk factors 

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our business services and financial condition may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies  many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that often change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with us and foreign laws and regulations  our services are subject to various laws and regulations including but not limited to the aca and antimoney laundering rules the growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations the enactment of new laws and regulations modifications of existing laws and regulations or the adverse application or interpretation of new or existing laws or regulations can adversely affect our business there is uncertainty regarding the potential future evolution and modification of the aca failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition   in addition as a us company we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control and similar multinational bodies and governmental agencies worldwide and the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” a violation of a sanction or embargo program or of the fcpa or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials could subject us and individual employees to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations 

 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services  the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changing industry standards to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality time to market cost and innovation relative to our competitors   the failure to provide more efficient and userfriendly customerfacing digital experience across internet and mobile platforms as well as in physical locations may adversely impact our business and operating results there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations the failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools natural language processing and artificial intelligencemachine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities 

our reputation results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy in the us we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws in addition the european union’s general data privacy regulation became fully effective in may 2018 failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we could be subject to reduced revenues increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks security vulnerabilities or internet disruptions we rely upon information technology “it” networks cloudbased platforms and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes some of which are provided by third party vendors cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation a cyberattack unauthorized intrusion malicious software infiltration network disruption or outage corruption of data or theft of personal or other sensitive information could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients result in liability or regulatory sanction or cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss in confidence in our ability to serve clients all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business the rapid speed of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks security vulnerabilities and internet disruptions enabled by new and emerging technologies may outpace our organizations ability to compete andor manage the risk appropriately 

data security and privacy leaks  we collect use and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients employees of our clients and our employees including bank account numbers credit card numbers social security numbers tax return information health care information retirement account information payroll information system and network passwords and other sensitive personal and business information at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data 

 

our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption  if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason including internet or systems failure or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption hardware applications and services including cloudbased services that we develop or procure from third party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could compromise the integrity and availability of our services any delays or failures caused by network outages software or hardware failures or other data processing disruptions could result in our inability to provide services in a timely fashion or at all we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner   and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business our acquisition of oasis in december 2018 strengthened our presence in the peo industry many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship within our peo business state and federal positions regarding coemployment relationships are in a constant state of flux and have changed with varying degrees of impact on our operations we cannot predict when changes will occur or forecast whether any particular future changes will be favorable or unfavorable to our operations   there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws incurring additional liabilities related to our peo business may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on their behalf resulting in financial loss to us as part of the payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed resulting in loss to us 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease or become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 

we invest our funds held for clients in high quality investmentgrade marketable securities money markets and other cash equivalents however these funds held for clients are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds 

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited in addition our ability to grow through significant acquisitions may be limited see also “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have made and may continue to make acquisitions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties acquisitions subject us to risks including increased debt assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations successful integration involves many challenges including the difficulty of developing and marketing new products and services our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the loss of key employees of an acquired business the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process in addition an acquisition could adversely impact cash flows andor operating results and dilute stockholder interests for many reasons including charges to our income to reflect the impairment of acquired intangible assets including goodwill interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred in connection with an acquisition and any issuance of securities in connection with an acquisition or new business venture that dilutes or lessens the rights of our current stockholders if the integration of any or all of our acquisitions or future acquisitions is not successful it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and stock price

certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that may constrain the operation of our business and our failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  the note purchase and guarantee agreement that we entered into in january 2019 in connection with our acquisition of oasis contains restrictive covenants which may restrict our flexibility to operate our business these covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness substantial changes in the general nature of our business and our subsidiaries taken as a whole certain merger transactions certain sales of assets and other matters all subject to certain exceptions the financial covenants which are based on quarterly financial tests require us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 350100 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 200100 in addition we will not permit certain of our indebtedness to exceed 20 of our consolidated stockholders’ equity if we do not comply with these covenants it could result in material and adverse effects on our operating results and our financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified people at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks copyrights patents or other means other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property including former employees may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete 

in the event we receive negative publicity our reputation and the value of our brand could be harmed and clients may not use our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business negative publicity relating to events or activities attributed to us our corporate employees or others associated with us whether or not justified may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand if we are unable to maintain quality hcm solutions and peo services our reputation with our clients may be harmed and the value of our brand may diminish in addition if our brand is negatively impacted it may have a material adverse effect on our business including challenges retaining clients or attracting new clients and recruiting talent and retaining employees 

we are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and as such we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees or other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct and employment and labor law matters the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

﻿ 

in addition to reporting operating income net income and diluted earnings per share which are us gaap measures we present adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are nongaap measures we believe adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of us gaap and are not required forms of disclosure by the sec as such they should not be considered as a substitute for the us gaap measures of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the us gaap measures the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the us gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies

the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 216 million as of may 31 2019  refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

during fiscal 2017 we entered into a limited partnership agreement to contribute a maximum amount of 100 million to a venture capital fund in the financial technology sector of which approximately 61 million has been contributed as of may 31 2019  in late fiscal 2019 we entered into a second limited partnership agreement to contribute a maximum amount of 100 million to a venture capital fund in the financial technology sector of which 01 million has been contributed as of may 31 2019 the timing of future contributions to be made to these venture capital funds cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain corporate employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date we also maintain corporate insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company

﻿ offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in both lowincome housing projects and venture capital funds focused on the financial technology sector these are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and represented less than one percent of our total assets as of may 31 2019

﻿ 

the changes in our operating cash flows for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 compared to the prior fiscal year periods were due to higher net income net income in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 benefited from the enactment of the tax act the change in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2019 was also due to higher adjustments for noncash items offset by fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in noncash adjustments for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a higher provision for deferred income taxes and higher amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through the acquisitions of oasis and lessor the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between all periods were impacted by the timing of collections from peo clients and payments peo payroll income tax and other liabilities in addition the larger outflows in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 were impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients

fluctuations in the net change in purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio t he amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations for fiscal 2019 in addition to timing fluctuations the net change in funds held for clients was impacted by changes in investment mix fiscal 2018 experienced greater sales of investments to fund client remittances than   purchases of investments  whereas fiscal 2017 reflected greater   purchases of investments than sales

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

client fund obligation balances are significantly impacted by the timing of the period end fluctuations in the net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances may 31 2019 fell on a friday which is a significant disbursement day for direct pay funds may 31 2018 fell on a thursday which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds these funds were then paid out on friday june 1 2018 may 31 2017 fell on a wednesday which is not a significant collection day for payroll tax funds but the federal semiweekly tax payment was delayed until thursday june 1 2017 due to the memorial day holiday weekend as such a higher than expected client fund obligation existed on may 31 2017 

net proceeds from longterm borrowings in fiscal 2019 we financed 8000 million related to the acquisition of oasis through the issuance of lon gterm private placement debt refer to note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our longterm financing 

dividends paid   in may 2019 and april 2018 our board increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders by 11 to 062 per share from 056 per share and by 12 to 056 per share from 050 per share respectively the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 80 79 and 81 for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

 

repurchases of common shares in july 2016 our board approved a program to repurchase up to 3500 million of our common stock authorized   through may 31 2019   during fiscal 2019  we repurchased 07 million shares for a total of 569 million  during fiscal 2018  we repurchased 25 million shares for a total of 1431 million   during fiscal 2017  we repurchased 29 million shares for a total of 1662 million of which 597 million was repurchased under a previously authorized common stock repurchase program all shares repurchased were retired in may 2019 our board approved a program to repurchase up to 4000 million of our common stock with authorization running from june 1 2019 through may 31 2022 the purpose of these programs is to manage common stock dilution 

activity related to equitybased plans the increase in cash flows related to stockbased awards for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and the decrease for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 were largely driven by changes in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options shares of common stock issued through the exercise of stock options were 09 million shares 06 million shares and 14 million shares for fiscal years 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation plans

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients’ payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we receive advance p ayments for setup fees on some of our service offerings from our clients advance payments received   for certain of our service offerings are considered a material right we defer the revenue associated with these advance payments recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected period to which the right exists 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain passthrough costs billed and incurred which primarily include payroll wages payroll taxes including federal and state unemployment insurance and certain guaranteed cost benefit premiums direct costs related to workers’ compensation and certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services 

  peo insurance reserves as part of the peo service we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to clients for the benefit of client employees workers compensation insurance is primarily provided under fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policies workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits in establishing the peo workers compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured guaranteed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier under the minimum premium insurance arrangement our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability includes estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends   adjustments to previously established reserves were not material for the fiscal years 2019 2018 or 2017 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter for fiscal 2019  it was determined that the company has three reporting units a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2019  to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value the qualitative assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2019  2018  or 2017  subsequent to the latest review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company’s goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable   we have determined that there is no impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for fiscal 2019  2018  or 2017  

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period 

we estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of the exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

 

the tax act enacted in december 2017 was the most comprehensive tax reform legislation approved in more than two decades and made broad and complex changes to the us federal corporate income taxation including but not limited to i reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a blended statutory tax rate of 292 for fiscal 2018 ii creating new or furthering limitations to the deductibility of officer compensation interest meals entertainment and other expenses and iii changing from a worldwide to a territorial taxation system as a result of the tax act we made a onetime revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities and made a change in the company’s annual effective income tax rate applied to income before income taxes for the first six months of fiscal 2018   refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further details 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios are invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of aa or higher and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds – including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds which are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds – along with us government agency and treasury securities and corporate bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2019  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were government agency discount notes vrdns and bank demand deposit accounts we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2019  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 19  compared to 15 and 12 for fiscal years 2018 and 2017  respectively when interest rates are rising the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a rising interest rate environment earnings increase from our shortterm investments and over time earnings increase from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2019 had an average duration of 29 years would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2019 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal reserve has periodically raised the federal funds rate in each of fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 as of may 31 2019  the federal funds rate was in the range of 225 to 250 as compared to a range of 150 to 175 as of may 31 2018  and in the range of 075 to 100 as of may 31 2017  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

• daily interest rate changes 

• seasonal variations in investment balances 

• actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale securities 

• the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

• changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

 

• financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 30 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately  48 billion for fiscal 2019  our anticipated allocation is approximately 45 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 55 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 197 million as of may 31 2019  compared with a net unrealized loss of 383 million as of may 31 2018  refer to note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2019  the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of 197 million to an unrealized loss of  607 million during fiscal 2018  the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of  414 million to an unrealized loss of  545 million the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 316 million as of july 17 2019  

as of may 31 2019 and 2018  we had 36 billion and 31 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 21 and 19 as of may 31 2019 and may 31 2018 respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2019  would be in the range of 150 million to 200 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2019 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 5679 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that unrealized losses of 27 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns a majority of these securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2019 and 2018 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

﻿ 

we have some credit risk exposure in connection with our purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry this credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 11 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those businesses approximately 99 have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market we believe that there is opportunity for us in the hcm market as the demand is moving downmarket to smaller businesses 

the market for hcm services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national regional local and online service providers in addition to traditional payroll processing and hr service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments payroll and hr systems and software are sold by many vendors human resource services “hrs” products also compete with a variety of providers of hr services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and hr and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and hr services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offerings and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas we believe that our excellent customer service together with our leadingedge technology and mobility applications distinguishes us from our competitors 

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and hr services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace we continue to enhance our saas solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success 

employees 

we believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is important to our future success and growth as of may 31 2018 we employed approximately 14300 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

intellectual property 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services

 it em 1a risk factors 

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change for example the ambiguity surrounding the department of labor’s fiduciary rule for retirement plan service changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business and reputation may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with us and foreign laws and regulations  our services are subject to various laws and regulations including but not limited to the aca and antimoney laundering rules the growth of our international operations via acquisition also subjects us to additional risks such as compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and united kingdom bribery act as of this fiscal year the financial impact of our international operations to our overall business has been insignificant however over time our international operations may grow and increase their significance to our business uncertainty regarding the potential future modifications of existing laws and regulations can also adversely affect our business there is uncertainty regarding the potential future evolution and modification of the aca failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have policies and procedures to monitor our compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations throughout the business and our acquisitions 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services  the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changing industry standards to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

 

our reputation results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy in the us we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws in addition the european union’s general data privacy regulation became fully effective in may 2018 failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we could be subject to reduced revenues increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks security vulnerabilities or internet disruptions we rely upon information technology “it” networks cloudbased platforms and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation a privacy or it security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business 

data security and privacy leaks  we collect use and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients employees of our clients and our employees including bank account numbers credit card numbers social security numbers tax return information health care information retirement account information payroll information system and network passwords and other sensitive personal and business information at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data 

our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventative or responsive measures as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information we may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption  if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason including internet or systems failure or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on their behalf resulting in financial loss to us as part of the payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed resulting in loss to us 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease or become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 

we invest our funds held for clients in high quality investmentgrade marketable securities money markets and other cash equivalents however these funds held for clients are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds 

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

﻿ 

 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified people at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks copyrights patents or other means other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property including former employees may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete 

we are involved in litigation from time to time arising from the operation of our business and as such we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees or other costs we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions from time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct and employment and labor law matters the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue was 18 billion for fiscal 2018 and 18 billion for fiscal 2017 reflecting growth of 2 and 3 respectively compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from increases in revenue per check which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts the impact of the acquisition of lessor on payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2018 was insignificant the acquisition of paychex advance contributed approximately 1 to payroll service revenue growth for fiscal 2017 

as of may 31 2018 including the lessor acquisition we served over 650000 payroll clients for fiscal 2017 our total payroll client base of 605000 was comparable to fiscal 2016 client retention was approximately 81 of the beginning client base for fiscal 2018 consistent with fiscal 2017 client retention was approximately 82 of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2016 

human resource services revenue hrs revenue was 15 billion for fiscal 2018 and 13 billion for fiscal 2017 reflecting growth of 14 and 12 respectively compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods hroi contributed approximately 6 to the growth in hrs revenue for fiscal 2018 and paychex advance contributed approximately 1 to the growth in hrs revenue for fiscal 2017 

for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 hrs revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across all major hcm services including comprehensive hr outsourcing services including hroi retirement services time and attendance and insurance services   hrs product key statistics are as follows 

﻿ 



1 the total number of worksite employees and clients for fiscal 2018 include hroi 

we continue to experience strong demand for our paychex hr services our largest hrs revenue stream as evidenced by the continued strong growth in client worksite employees for both our aso and peo retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participant funds along with an increase in the number of plans served insurance services revenue growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 benefited from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants in addition for fiscal 2017 revenue was positively impacted by higher average premiums in our workers’ compensation insurance product 

﻿ 

total service revenue total service revenue increased 7 for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 attributable to the factors previously discussed 

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients increased 26 for fiscal 2018 and 10 for fiscal 2017 to 635 million and 506 million respectively for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 the increases were primarily due to higher average interest rates earned 

average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1 for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the impact of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” on employee withholdings and changes in client mix which offset the impact of wage inflation average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased approximately 1 for fiscal 2017 primarily due to the impacts of timing of certain remittances due to taxing authorities and client mix

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

total expenses increased 10 for fiscal 2018 and 6 for fiscal 2017 for fiscal 2018 compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher headcount reflecting accelerated investment in technology sales teams and the impact of the acquisitions of lessor and hroi in addition compensationrelated expenses in fiscal 2018 included a onetime bonus paid to nonmanagement employees for fiscal 2017 compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher headcount in operations partially offset by lower variable selling costs as of may 31 2018 we had approximately 14300 employees including lessor compared with 13700 employees as of may 31 2017 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods the increase in depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in internally developed software that was placed in service over the past two years as well as changes to the useful life of certain assets which accelerated depreciation expense recognition 

expense growth for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our peo other expenses include items such as noncapital equipment delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business continued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 for fiscal 2018 other expenses also reflect a onetime expense of 326 million related to the termination of certain license agreements in addition the combined acquisitions of hroi and lessor contributed approximately 5 to the total expense growth for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 the acquisition of paychex advance contributed approximately 1 to the growth in total expenses for fiscal 2017 

operating income operating income increased 4 to 13 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8 to 12 billion for fiscal 2017 the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed operating income as a percent of total revenue was 381 393 and 388 for the fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively adjusted operating income increased 6 to 13 billion for fiscal 2018 and 8 to 12 billion for fiscal 2017 see th e “nongaap financial measures” section of this item 7 for further discussion of this nongaap measure 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue investment income net increased 66 for fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned the increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2018 was the result of higher net income partially offset by share repurchases business acquisitions and an increase in the rate for quarterly dividend payments investment income net increased 13 for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned partially offset by a 2 decrease in average investment balances 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 280 for fiscal 2018 and was 343 for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was significantly impacted by the tax act as a result of the tax act we recorded a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 255 million for fiscal 2018 for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities this amount impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 007 per share for fiscal 2018 in addition as it relates to the tax act our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 benefited from a reduced statutory tax rate applied to our current year taxable income the effective income tax rates were impacted by additional discrete tax items recognized during fiscal 2018 fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 effective june 1 2016 we earlyadopted new accounting guidance related to employee stockbased compensation payments which resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized in income tax expense this discrete tax benefit impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 004 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 and 005 per diluted share for fiscal 2017 during fiscal 2018 we recognized a tax benefit as a result of the termination of certain license agreements which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 002 per diluted share during fiscal 2016 we recognized a net tax benefit on income derived in prior tax years related to customerfacing software that we produced which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 006 per diluted share additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes

in addition to reporting operating income net income and diluted earnings per share which are us gaap measures we present adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are nongaap measures we believe adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period adjusted operating income adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of gaap and are not a required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such they should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measures of operating income net income and diluted earnings per share and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measures the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 848 million as of may 31 2018 are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments in addition during fiscal 2017 we entered into a limited partnership agreement to contribute a maximum amount of 100 million to a venture capital fund in the financial technology sector of which approximately 42 million has been contributed as of may 31 2018  the timing of future contributions to be made to the venture capital fund cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above

operating cash flow activities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 is the result of higher net income and adjustments for noncash items and an increase in cash provided by fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in net income in fiscal 2018 was impacted by the enactment of the tax act the decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of net cash outflows from fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for noncash items the increase in noncash adjustments for fiscal 2018 and for fiscal 2017 was largely due to higher depreciation expense related to an increase in internally developed software placed in service over the last three years the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between all periods were impacted by the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities in addition the larger outflows in fiscal 2017 were impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients 

investing cash flow activities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 had greater purchases of shortterm or availableforsale investments of client collections than sales of investments to fund client fund remittances whereas fiscal 2016 reflected more sales of investments than purchases for fiscal 2016  the client fund timing impacts reflected in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments were somewhat offset by a change in mix of investments fiscal 2016 had more funds invested in vrdn securities and less in cash equivalents 

in general fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

client fund obligation balances are significantly impacted by the timing of the period end fluctuations in the net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances may 31 2018 fell on a thursday which is a significant collection day for direct pay funds these funds were then paid out on friday june 1 2018 may 31 2017 fell on a wednesday compared to may 31 2016 which was a tuesday payroll tax funds continued to be collected on wednesday may 31 2017 yet the federal semiweekly tax payment was delayed until thursday june 1 2017 due to the memorial day holiday weekend as such a higher client fund obligation existed on may 31 2017 than may 31 2016 the timing of the memorial day holiday in may 2016 prompted many clients to remit their payrolls before the holiday weekend resulting in lower direct deposit funds as of may 31 2016 in addition may 31 2016 was a tuesday a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of readychex and tax payments 

dividends paid   in april 2018 and july 2017 our board increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders by 12 to 056 per share from 050 per share and by 9 to 050 per share from 046 per share respectively the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 79 81 and 80 for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

repurchases of common shares in july 2016 our board approved a program to repurchase up to 3500 million of our common stock authorized through may 31 2019 the “july 2016 program” the purpose of the july 2016 program is to manage common stock dilution during fiscal 2018  we repurchased 25 million shares for a total of 1431 million  during fiscal 2017  we repurchased 29 million shares for a total of 1662 million of the shares repurchased during fiscal 2017  597 million was repurchased under a previously authorized common stock repurchase program during fiscal 2016  we purchased 22 million shares for a total of 1079 million all under the previously authorized common stock repurchase program shares repurchased were retired 

activity related to equitybased plans the decrease in cash flows related to stockbased awards for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and the increase for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 were largely driven by changes in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options shares of common stock issued through the exercise of stock options were 06 million shares 14 million shares and 09 million shares for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively refer to note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation plans

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients’ payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

for certain of our service offerings we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients we defer revenue associated with these advance payments recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of clients 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct passthrough costs billed and incurred which primarily include payroll wages payroll taxes and certain benefit premiums direct costs related to certain benefit plans where we retain risk are recognized as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

  peo insurance reserves as part of the peo service we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees workers compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policy with a national insurance carrier workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits in establishing the peo workers compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier under the minimum premium insurance arrangement our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly workers compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter for fiscal 2018 it was determined that the company has three reporting units a qualitative analysis was performed for all reporting units in fiscal 2018 to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting units had declined below its carrying value the qualitative assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 subsequent to the latest review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company’s goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset we have determined that there is no impairment of longlived assets for the fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period 

we estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards with the earlyadoption of accounting standards update no 201609 a t the time of the exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income previously we accounted for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paidin capital in the consolidated balance sheets 

 

the tax act enacted in december 2017 was the most comprehensive tax reform legislation approved in more than two decades and makes broad and complex changes to the us federal corporate income taxation including but not limited to i reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a blended statutory tax rate of 292 for fiscal 2018 ii creating new or furthering limitations to the deductibility of officer compensation interest meals entertainment and other expenses and iii changing from a worldwide to a territorial taxation system as a result of the tax act we made a onetime revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities and made a change in the company’s annual effective income tax rate applied to income before income taxes for the first six months of fiscal 2018 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions 

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of aa or higher and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds – including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds which are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds – along with us government agency securities and corporate bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2018  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were vrdns and bank demand deposit accounts we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2018  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 15  compared to 12 and 11 for fiscal years 2017 and 2016  respectively when interest rates are rising the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a rising interest rate environment earnings increase from our shortterm investments and over time increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2018 had an average duration of 31 years would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2018 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

after almost seven years of no movement in the federal funds rate the federal reserve has raised the rate by 25 basis points six times since december 2015 as of may 31 2018  the federal funds rate was in the range of 150 to 175 as compared to in the range of 075 to 100 as of may 31 2017  and in the range of 025 to 050 as of may 31 2016  on june 13 2018 the federal funds rate was raised an additional 25 basis points to a range of 175 to 20 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

• daily interest rate changes 

• seasonal variations in investment balances 

• actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale securities 

• the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

 

• changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

• financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 30 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately  50 billion for fiscal 2018  our anticipated allocation is approximately 40 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 60 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of 383 million as of may 31 2018  compared with a net unrealized gain of 320 million as of may 31 2017  refer to note g of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2018  the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized gain of 414 million to an unrealized loss of  545 million during fiscal 2017  the net unrealized loss or gain on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized loss of  305 million to an unrealized gain of  695 million the net unrealized loss on our investment portfolios was approximately  330 million as of july 18 2018  

as of may 31 2018 and 2017  we had 31 billion and 46 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 19 and 17 as of may 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2018  would be in the range of 200 million to 250 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2018 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 22 billion of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized losses of 407 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns a significant portion of these securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2018 and 2017 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

﻿ 

we have some credit risk exposure in connection with our purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry this credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 12 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those businesses approximately 99 have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market the average client size within our existing client base is approximately 160 employees we believe that there is opportunity for us in the hcm market as the demand is moving downmarket to smaller businesses 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany revenue from operations in germany and longlived assets in germany are not material we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for th e fiscal year ended may 31 2017 “fiscal 2017 ” client retention was approximately 81  of our beginning of the year client base  a slight decrease from the prior fiscal year’s nearrecordhigh level  no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the market for hcm services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly fewer clients than us in addition to traditional payroll processing and hr service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and hr systems and departments payroll and hr systems and software are sold by many vendors hrs products also compete with a variety of providers of hr services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and hr and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and hr services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offerings and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas we believe that our excellent customer service together with our leadingedge technology and mobility applications distinguishes us from our competitors 

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of f ederal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and hr services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace we continue to enhance our saas solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success 

employees 

as of may 31 2017 we employed approximately 137 00 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

intellectual property 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

 

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in that quarter

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change for example the department of labor’s recently adopted fiduciary rule for retirement plan service changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business may be adversely impacted if the aca is repealed in its entirety or certain aspects of aca are repealed or modified as a result of recent political changes on january 20 2017 president donald j trump issued an executive order stating that it is the policy of the new administration to seek the prompt repeal of the aca while initial attempts at repeal and replacement have not been successful the current administration continues to work toward that goal in may 2017 the us house of representatives approved legislation to repeal and replace major parts of the aca and the us senate is currently considering the legislation uncertainties exist regarding if and when the aca will ultimately be modified or repealed if the aca is modified to eliminate the employer reporting requirements or if the aca is repealed and new legislation does not include such reporting requirements it will negatively impact the revenue we currently generate from our esr service uncertainty regarding the potential future modification repeal or replacement of the aca could adversely affect our ability to sell our esr application to new clients failure to update our services to comply with modified or new legislation in the area of health care reform as well as failure to educate and assist our clients regarding this legislation could adversely impact our business reputation and negatively impact our client base 

 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services  the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements changes in customer requirements frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changing industry standards to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our current products and introduce new products in order to keep pace with products offered by our competitors enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements and adapt to technological advancements and changing industry standards we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

our reputation results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with data privacy laws and regulations our services require the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees including personal or identifying information as well as their financial and payroll data our applications are subject to various complex government laws and regulations on the federal state and local levels including those governing personal privacy in the us we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 the family medical leave act of 1993 the aca federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties including fines which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and future enactment of more restrictive laws rules or regulations andor future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability 

we could be subject to reduced revenues increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position as a result of cyberattacks security vulnerabilities or internet disruptions we rely upon information technology “it” networks cloudbased platforms and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation a privacy or it security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business 

data security and privacy leaks  we collect use and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients employees of our clients and our employees including bank account numbers credit card numbers social security numbers tax return information health care information retirement account information payroll information system and network passwords and other sensitive personal and business information at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data 

our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption  if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason including internet or systems failure or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on their behalf resulting in financial loss to us as part of the payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we may not be reimbursed resulting in loss to us 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the political and economic environment trade monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and variability when there is a slowdown in the economy employment levels and interest rates may decrease or become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 

we invest our funds held for clients in high quality investmentgrade marketable securities money markets and other cash equivalents however these funds held for clients are subject to general market interest rate credit and liquidity risks these risks may be exacerbated during periods of unusual financial market volatility the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds 

 

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified people at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties to the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks copyrights patents or other means other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property including former employees may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own and others’ advantage competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand and may adversely affect our ability to compete

as of may 31 2017 we served approximately 605000 payroll clients consistent with levels one year ago  for fiscal 201 6 and fiscal 201 5  our total payroll client base growth was approximately 2 the flat growth for fiscal 2017 was impacted by a challenging comparison for new sales to a strong fiscal 2016  which benefited from the implementation of the aca  in addition we experienced a slight increase in client attrition for fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year client retention was approximately 81 of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2017 compared to approximately 82 for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015  

human resource services revenue hrs revenue was 13 billion for fisc al 201 7 and  12   b illion for fiscal 201 6  reflecting growth of 1 2  and 13 respectively compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods 

for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 hrs revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client base across all major hcm services including comprehensive outsourcing services retirement services time and attendance and hr administration   hrs product key statistics are as follows 

﻿ 



we continue to experience strong demand for our paychex hr services our largest hrs revenue stream as evidenced by the continued strong growth in client worksite employees for both our aso and peo 

retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2017 benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participant funds growth for fiscal 2016 was tempered by a lower average asset value of participants’ funds offset somewhat by higher basis points earned from external fund managers 

insurance services revenue growth for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 benefited from growth of our fullservice aca product and growth in the number of applicants in addition higher average premiums in our workers’ compensation product positively impacted revenue for both fiscal years 

advance partne rs contributed approximately 1  to the growth in hrs revenue for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016  

﻿ 

total service revenue total service revenue increased 7  for fiscal 201 7 and 8 for fiscal 2016  attributable to the factors previously discussed 

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients increased 10  for fiscal 201 7   and   9  for fiscal 201 6 to 506 million and 461 million respectively  for fiscal 201 7  the increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates earned for fiscal 201 6  the increase was attributed to higher average interest rates earned as well as slightly higher average investment balances  

average investment balanc es for funds held for clients de creased approximately 1  for fiscal 201 7 primarily due to the impacts of timing of certain remittances due to taxing authorities and client mix average investment balances increased   approximately 1  for fiscal 201 6 driven mainly by client base growth and wage inflation    partially offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and sga expenses for fiscal years 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

total expenses increased 6  for fiscal 201 7 and 7 for fiscal 2016  the increases in total expenses were driven largely by growth in compensationrelated expenses for fiscal 2017 compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher headcount in operations partially offset by lower variable selling costs for fiscal 201 6  compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher wages and performancebased compensation costs    as of may 31 2017 we had approximately 137 00 employees compared with 13500 employees as of may 31 201 6  

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or a ccelerated methods the higher growth rate for depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by higher depreciation related to an increase in internally developed software that was placed in service over the past two years 

expense growth for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was impacted by continued growth in our peo other expenses include items such as noncapital equipment delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business c ontinued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 201 7 and fiscal 201 6  advance partners contributed approximately 1 to the growth in to tal expenses for fiscal 2017 and less than 1 to the growth for fiscal 2016  

operating income operating income increased 8  for fiscal 2017 to 12 billion and 9 for fiscal 201 6 to 11 billion  the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed operating income as a percent of total revenue was 393  388  and 385 for the fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue investment income net increased 13 for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher average interest rates earned partially offset by a 2 decrease in average investment balances investment income net de creased 28  for fiscal 201 6 as the result of immaterial losses on equity method investments and a 9 decrease in average investment balances partially offset by higher   average interest rate s earned  the decrease in average investment balances for fiscal 201 6 was   primarily the result of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of advance partners in december 2015 and stock repurchase activity this lower starting balance for fiscal 2017 along with additional stock repurchases and higher dividend payments made during the fiscal year contributed to the decline for fiscal 2017 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 34 3 for both fiscal 201 7   and fiscal 2016 and was 363 for fiscal 2015 the effective income tax rate s w ere impacted by discrete tax items recognized during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016  effective june 1 2016 we earlyadopted new account ing guidance related to employee stockbased compensation payments which resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized in income tax expense this discrete tax benefit impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 005 per share for fiscal 2017 during fiscal 2016 we recognized a net tax benefit on income derived in prior tax years related to customerfacing software that we produced during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we engaged tax specialists to assess the qualification of such software for the federal “qualified production activities deduction” based on this assessment we concluded that certain of our software offerings qualified for this tax deduction in prior tax years and therefore we recorded the tax benefits and related tax reserves as a discrete tax item in fiscal 2016 which increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 006 additional discrete tax items recognized during each respective period are insignificant refer to note j of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income and diluted earnings per share   both increased 8  to  8173 million and 225 per share respectively for fiscal 201 7 for fiscal 2016 net income increased 12  to  7568 million and d iluted earnings per share increased 13 to 209 per share these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed   adjusted net income increased 9 to 7990 million for fiscal 2017 and increased 9 to 7357 million for fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 220 per share for fiscal 2017 and 203 per share for fiscal 2016 reflecting increases of 8 and 10 respectively refer to the “nongaap financial measures” section that follows for a discussion of these nongaap measures 

nongaap financial measures a djusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are summarized as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in addition to reporting net income and diluted earnings per share us gaap measures we present adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are nongaap measures we believe adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both exclude the additional tax benefit or shortfall related to employee stockbased compensation payments recognized in income taxes this arose from earlyadoption in june 2016 of new accounting guidance but will be a recurring item going forward this item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price neither of which is in the control of management also excluded is a net tax benefit that was recorded in fiscal 2016 for income derived in prior tax years related to customerfacing software that we produced this was an unusual event that is not expected to recur we believe presenting net income and diluted earnings per share excluding these particular discrete tax items allows a better understanding of core business performance adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of gaap and are not a required form of disclosure by the sec as such they should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measures of net income and diluted earnings per share and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measures the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of may 31 2017 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 7774 million and no debt we believe that our investments as of may 31 2017 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2017  along with projected operating cash flows and available shortterm financing  will support our normal business operations capital purchases business acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future

﻿ 

subsequent to may 31 2017 paychex advance borrowed approximately 5 50 million under this line which remains outstanding as of the date of this report 

the credit facilities contain various financial and operational covenants that are usual and customary for such arrangements we were in compliance with these covenants as of may 31 2017  

certain lenders under th ese credit facilit ies  and their respective affiliates have performed and may in the future perform for us various commercial banking investment banking underwriting and other financial advisory services for which they have received and will continue to receive in the future customary fees and expenses 

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2017  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2017  

﻿ 



﻿ 





the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 392 million as of may 31 2017  refer to note j of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 738 million as of may 31 2017 are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments in addition during fiscal 2017 we entered into a limited partnership agreement to contribute a maximum amount of 100 million to a venture capital fund in the financial technology sector of which approximately 18m has been contributed as of may 31 2017 the timing of future contributions to be made to the venture capital fund cannot be specifically or reasonably determined and thus have been excluded from the table above 

 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services ® and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years arrangements with some associates have been discontinued and th ere are currently five associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015 was 164 million  161   million and 151 million respectively 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in both lowincome housing projects and a venture capital fund focused on the financial technology sector these are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2017  

operating cash flow activities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the de crease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 is primarily the result of cash outflows from fluctuations in our oper ating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher net income and adjust ments for noncash items  the increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015   is primarily the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items    and the increase in cash provided by fluctuations in our oper ating assets and liabilities the increase in noncash adjustments for fiscal 2017 and for fiscal 2016 was largely due to higher depreciation expense related to an increase in internally developed software placed in service over the last two years in addition for fiscal 2016 the increase was impacted by an increase in the deferred tax provision the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between all periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities in addition the larger outflows in fiscal 2017 were impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agency clients 

 

investing cash flow activities

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note f of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment s are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio specific timing impacting cash flows for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 are discussed further in the financing cash flows discussion of net changes in client fund obligations fiscal 2017 had greater purchases of shortterm or availableforsale investments of client collections than sales of investments to fund client fund remittances whereas fiscal 2016 reflected more sales of investments than purchases for fiscal 2016 the client fund timing impacts reflected in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments were somewhat offset by a change in mix of investments when compared to fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016 had more funds invested in vrdn securities and less in cash equivalents 

in general fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment s primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in th e “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

other investing activities to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  we purchased approximately 06 million   49 million and 69 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the former chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

there were no acquisitions completed during fiscal 2017  during fiscal 2016  we paid net of cash acquired  2961   million for the acquisition of advance partners and during fiscal year 2015 we paid net of cash acquired   271 million for an immaterial business acquisition

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

 

client fund obligation balances are significantly impacted by the timing of the period end fluctuations in the net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances may 31 2017 fell on a wednesday compared to may 31 2016 which was a tuesday payroll tax funds continued to be collected on wednesday may 31 2017 yet the federal semiweekly tax payment was delayed until thursday june 1 2017 due to the memorial day holiday weekend as such a higher client fund obligation existed on may 31 2017 than may 31 2016 the timing of the memorial day holiday in may 2016 prompted many clients to remit their payrolls before the holiday weekend resulting in lower direct deposit funds as of may 31 2016 

timing for fiscal 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow position may 31 2016 was a tuesday a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of readychex and tax payments may 31 2015 was a sunday and fridays are typically higher cash collection days this timing left higher cash on hand at may 31 2015 compared to may 31 2016  as a result there was a net cash outflow over the period in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

dividends paid   in july 201 6  our board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 10  to 0 46 per share from 0 42 per share in july 2015  our board increased our quarter ly dividend to stockholders by 11 to 0 42 per share from 03 8 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 8 1  8 0  and 8 2  for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

repurchases of common shares in july 2016 our board approved a program to repurchase up to 3500 million of our common stock authorized through may 31 2019 the “july 2016 program” in addition under a previous plan initiated in may 2014 that expired may 31 2017 the “may 2014 program” we were also authorized to repurchase up to 3500 million of our common stock the purpose of both programs is to manage common stock dilution during fiscal 2017  we repurchased 29 million shares for a total of 1662 million  597 million of the total purchased was under our may 2014 program and 1065 million was under our july 2016 program during fiscal 2016  we repurchased 22 million shares for a total of 1079 million and 39 million shares for a total of 1824 million respectively all under the may 2014 plan shares repurchased were retired as of may 31 2017  all amounts authorized under the may 2014 program have been purchased 

a ctivity related to equitybased plans    the in crease in activity related to st ockbased awards for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and the decrease for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was largely driven by changes in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options shares of c ommon stock   issued through the exercise of stock options were 1  4 million shares 0  9 million shares and 1  6 million shares for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively during fiscal 2017  t he increase in proceeds was partially offset by the prospective change in classification of excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased compensation which is now reflected in operating activities refer to note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation plans

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of th is form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients’ payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

for certain of our service offerings we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients we defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the related costs recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of clients 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct passthrough costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes and certain benefit premiums d irect costs related to certain benefit plans where we retain risk are classified as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

  peo insurance reserves as part of the peo service we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees workers compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation insurance policy with a national insurance carrier workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits in establishing the peo workers compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier under the minimum premium insurance arrangement our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly workers compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends 

goodwill and other intangible assets   goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of t he reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter for fiscal 2017 it was determined that we had three reporting units a qualitative analysis was performed for our paychex advance reporting unit the assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors for all other defined reporting units a quantitative analysis was performed to determine if it morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit had declined below its carrying value based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2017  2016  or 2015  subsequent to the latest review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the company’s goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

the fair value of stock awards is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant for grants that do not accrue dividends or dividend equivalents the fair value is the stock price reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period or performance period 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

we earlyadopted new guidance related to employee stockbased compensation costs effective june 1 2016 refer to note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information 

refer to note e of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain sto ckbased awards with the earlyadoption of acco unting standards update no 201609  a t the time of the exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards  we recognize any excess tax benefit within income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income previously  we account ed for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paidin capital in the consolidated balance sheets  

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note j of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions  

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with ratings of aa or higher and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds – inc luding general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds which are secu red by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds – along with us government agency securities and corporate bonds  we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2017  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were vrdns and bank demand deposit accounts we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2017  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 12  compared   to 11   and 10   for fiscal years 2016 and   2015  respectively when interest rates are rising the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a rising interest rate environment earnings increase from our shortterm investments and over time increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2017 had an average duration of 32 years would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2017 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

after almost seven years of no movement in t he federal funds rate  the federal reserve has raised the rate by 25 basis points three times since december 2015 as of may 31 2017  t he federal funds rate was in the range of in the range of 075 to 10 as compared to in the range of 025 to 050 as of may 31 2016  and in the range of zero to 025 as of may 31 2015  on june 15 2017 the federal funds rate was raised a fourth time to a range of 1  0  to 125 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

• daily interest rate changes 

• seasonal variations in investment balances 

• actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale securities 

• the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

 

• changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

• financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest r ates would be approximately 30 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately  50 billion for fiscal 2017  our anticipate d allocation is approximately 40  invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average durat ion of less than 30 days and 60  invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 320 million as of may 31 2017  compar ed with a net unrealized gain of 476   million as of may 31 2016  refer to note g of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2017  the net unrealized gain or loss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized loss of  305 million to an unrealized gain of   695 million during fiscal 2016  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfo lios ranged from an unrealized gain of  37 million t o  722 million the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 272 as of july 19 2017  

as of may 31 2017 and 2016  we had 46 billion and 41 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was   17 both as of may 31 2017 and 2016  respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsa le securities as of may 31 2017  would be in the range of 200 million to 250 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2017 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 6074 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized losses of 58 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns a significant portion of these securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2017 and 2016 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment  

﻿ 

we have some credit risk exposure in connection with our purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing payroll funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry this credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of services within payroll  we differentiate the markets we serve between smallbusiness and midmarket companies our sales representatives are also supported by marketing advertising public relations trade shows and telemarketing programs we utilize a virtual sales force to service geographical areas where we may not have a local presence or for products for which we do not have a local sales force we sell hrs products to both new clients and our existing client base 

in addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients certified public accountants “cpas” and banks for new client referrals approximately 50 of our new core payroll clients excluding business acquisitions come from these referral sources our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking national association s  and franchise channels 

we have a longstanding partnership with the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” as the preferred payroll provider for its aicpa business solutions tm program more than half of the cpa firms in the us are enrolled and actively participating in the paychex partner program from aicpa business solutions our current partnership agreement with the aicpa is in p lace through september 2021  we also partner with various state cpa society organizations 

our website which is available at wwwpaychexcom  includes online payroll sales presentations and service and product information it also serves as a costefficient tool that serves as a source of leads and new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales force this online tool allows us to market to clients and prospective clients in other geographical areas where we do not have a direct sales presence in addition our insurance services website which is available at wwwpaychexinsurancecom  provides information to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry and generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact with one of our professional insurance agents

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 11 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those businesses approximately 99 have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market the average client size within our existing client base is approximately 167 employees we believe that there is opportunity for us in the hcm market as the demand is moving downmarket to smaller businesses 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany revenue from operations in germany and longlived assets in germany are not material we also have a jointventure arrangement to provide payroll and human resource services in brazil we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for th e fiscal year ended may 31 2016 “fiscal 2016 ” client retention was in excess of 82 of our beginning of the year client base  consistent with the prior year’s record high  no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the market for hcm services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly fewer clients than us in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors hrs products also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offerings and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas we believe that our excellent customer service together with our leadingedge technology and mobility applications distinguishes us from our competitors 

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of f ederal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace we continue to enhance our saas solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success 

employees 

as of may 31 2016 we employed approximately 135 00 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

intellectual property 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in that quarter

 it em 1a risk factors 

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our clients and our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform the aca was enacted in march 2010 and entails sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018   as a service provider we have a responsibility to our clients to help them understand their increased obligations under the federal and state regulations facing employers under the aca  failure to provide clients with appropriate information or solutions to effectively manage their health care benefits and related costs could have an adverse impact on our reputation and a negative impact on our client base there is no guarantee that solutions we have developed to help clients navigate health care legislation will continue to be readily accepted by clients which could have a material adverse impact on our insurance services business insurance services revenue is at risk for lower commission revenue from underwriters if clients move away from traditional insurance policies utilized in the past or as a result of pressure on commission rates driven by restrictions on insurers as to use of premiums refer to the discussion later in this section on changes in health insurance and workers compensation insurance rates and underlying claim trends for a discussion of health care reform as it impacts our peo 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenues increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position we rely upon information technology “it” networks cloudbased platforms and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation a privacy or it security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business 

data security and privacy leaks  we collect use and retain increasingly large amounts of personal information about our clients employees of our clients and our employees including bank account numbers credit card numbers social security numbers tax return information health care information retirement account information payroll information system and network passwords and other sensitive personal and business information at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data 

our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment that we host the security of our it infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers purchasing decisions as cyber threats continue to evolve we are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information while we have security systems and it infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information if our security measures are breached our business could be substantially harmed and we could incur significant liabilities any such breach or unauthorized access could negatively affect our ability to attract new clients cause existing clients to terminate their agreements with us result in reputational damage and subject us to lawsuits regulatory fines  or other actions or liabilities which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

data loss and business interruption  if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claim experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claim activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds 

constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have periodically borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet shortterm liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us growth in services for funding payrolls of our clients in the temporary staffing industry may be constricted if access to financing becomes limited if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to attract and retain qualified people which could impact the quality of our services and customer satisfaction our success growth and financial results depend in part on our continuing ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified people at all levels including management technical compliance and sales personnel competition for these individuals can be intense and we may not be able to retain our key people or attract assimilate or retain other highlyqualified individuals in the future which could harm our future success 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk refer to item 7a of this form 10k for a discussion on market risk factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue was 17 billion for both fiscal 201 6 and fiscal 201 5  reflecting growth of 4 for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014  both fiscal 201 6 and fiscal 201 5 benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check  revenue per check improved as a result of price i ncreases net of discounts fiscal 2016 also benefited from two additional processing days during the year 

for fiscal 201 6 and fiscal 201 5  our total payroll client base growth was approximately 2 client retention was in excess of 82 of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 201 6 consistent with fiscal 2015 which reflected a record high 

human resource services revenue hrs revenue was  12 billion for fiscal 201 6 and  10   b illion for fiscal 201 5  reflecting growth of 1 3  and 18 respectively compared to each of the prior fiscal year periods 

for both fiscal 201 6 and fiscal 201 5  hrs revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client base across all major hcm services including comprehensive outsourcing services retirement services time and attendance and hr   hrs product key statistics are as follows 

﻿ 

﻿ 



we continue to experience strong demand for our paychex hr services our largest hrs revenue stream as evidenced by the continued doubledigit growth in client worksite employees during both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 the peo in particular experienced strong demand 

retirement services revenue growth was tempered in fiscal 2016 by a lower average asset value of participants’ funds offset somewhat by higher basis points earned from external fund managers retirement services revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 benefited from pricing and higher average asset value of participants’ funds 

insurance services revenue growth for both fiscal 2016 and 2015 benefited from growth in our fullservice aca product in addition higher average premiums and clients in our workers’ compensation product positively impacted revenue in both years 

our hr administration products including time and attendance and hr management contributed to growth through strong sales of our saas solutions time and attendance solutions benefited from a small business acquisition in fiscal 2015 

﻿ 

total service revenue total service revenue increased 8  for fiscal 201 6 and 9 for fiscal 2015 attributable to the factors previously discussed 

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients increased 9  for fiscal 201 6   and   increased   3  for fiscal 201 5  for fiscal 201 6  the increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates and slightly higher average investment balances  for fiscal 2015 the increase was primarily due to an increase in average investment balances while average interest rates earned were flat 

average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 1  for fiscal 201 6 and 3 for fiscal 2015 the net increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2016 was mainly due to client base growth and wage inflation partially offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates the increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2015 was mainly driven by increases in client base and wage inflation

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and sga expenses for fiscal years 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

total expenses increased 7  for fiscal 201 6 and 10 for fiscal 2015 f iscal 2015 was impacted by costs relating to the new minimum premium plan health insurance offering within our peo introduced in january 2014 which contributed three percentage points of the increase in total expenses for fiscal 2015 

the increases in total expenses were driven largely by growth in compensationrelated expenses for fiscal 201 6  compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher wages and performancebased compensation costs    for fiscal 2015 compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher sales headcount and variable costs resulting from strong sales execution along with higher employeebenefitrelated costs primarily medical expenses as of may 31 2016 we had approximately 135 00 employees compared with 13000 employees as of may 31 201 5  

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or a ccelerated methods the higher growth rate for depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by higher depreciation related to an increase in internally developed software that was placed in service 

other expenses include items such as noncapital equipment delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business other expenses increased due to growth within the peo in addition continued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 201 6 and fiscal 201 5  

operating income operating income increased 9  for fiscal 201 6 and 7 for fiscal 2015 the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 



﻿ 

operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue was approximately 38 for each of the f iscal years 2016 2015 and 2014  

nongaap financial measure in addition to reporting operating income a us generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “ sec” as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue investment income net de creased 28  for fiscal 201 6 as the result of immaterial losses on equity method investments and a decrease in average investment balances partially offset by higher   average interest rate s earned  the decrease in average investment balances for fiscal 201 6 is the result of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of advance partners in december 2015 and stock repurchase activity investment income increased 17 for fiscal 2015 due to an increase in average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations  while interest rates earned remained relatively flat 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 34 3 for fiscal 201 6 compared to 363 for fiscal 2015 and 365 for fiscal 2014 the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 is related primarily to a net tax benefit that was recorded for income derived in prior tax years from customerfacing software we produced during the first quarter we engaged tax specialists to assess the qualification of such software for the federal “qualified production activities deduction” based on this assessment we concluded that certain of our software offerings qualified for this tax deduction in prior tax years and therefore we recorded the tax benefits and related tax reserves as a discrete item in the first quarter excluding this net tax benefit the effective income tax rate would have been approximately 358 for fiscal 2016 refer to note j of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and earnings per share net income increased 12  to  7568 million for fiscal 201 6 and 8 to 6749 million for fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share increased 13 to 209 per share for fiscal 201 6 and 8 to 185 per share for fiscal 2015 these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed   excluding the net tax benefit recognized in the first quarter net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 would have increased 9 and 10 respectively 

﻿ 

liquidity and capital resources

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2016 or as of may 31 2016  

certain of the financial institutions are also parties to our credit facility and irrevocable standby letters of credit which are discussed below

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2016  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2016  

﻿ 



﻿ 





 

the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 542 million as of may 31 2016  refer to note j of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 683 million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services ® and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years arrangements with some associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014 was 161 million  151million and 144 million respectively 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2016  

operating cash flow activities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is primarily the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items along with the positive impact from fluctuations in our oper ating assets and liabilities the increase for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items offset by the decrease in cash provided by changes in our oper ating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments to net income increased for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 compared to the respective prior year periods  the increase in noncash adjustments for fiscal 2016 was largely due to higher depreciation expense related to an increase in internally developed software placed in service and an increase in the deferred tax provision the increase in noncash adjustments for fiscal 2015 was largely due to higher amortization of premiums on availableforsale securities as the company has increased its holdings of longerduration investments and higher stockbased compensation costs the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between all periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

 

investing cash flow activities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note f of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 there was a significant fluctuation due to timing of the day of the week for fiscal yearend there were larger cash outflows on tuesday may 31 2016 that required the liquidation of funds held in the funds held for clients portfolio this resulted in positive cash flow from investing activities for fiscal 2016 our net cash inflow from funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2016 was partially offset by the change in mix of investments with more invested in vrdn securities and less in cash equivalents as of may 31 2016  for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 there was not a significant fluctuation due to timing of the day of the week for fiscal yearend the net cash outflow position for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 is related to more purchases of shortterm and availableforsale securities resulting from higher average collections from clients see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations 

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in th e “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

other investing activities to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  we purchased approximately 49 million   69 million and 47 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board”

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

 

fluctuations in net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances timing for fiscal 2016 resulted in a net cash outflow position may 31 2016 was a tuesday a larger cash outflow day due to clearing of readychex and tax payments as may 31 2015 was a sunday  cash on hand would have been higher  as a result there was a net cash outflow over the period in fiscal 2016 

may 31 2015 fell on a sunday while may 31 2014 fell on a saturday friday is a large cash outflow day for direct deposit funds partially offset by tax payment funds collected on that day this impact was consistent and did not impact the net cash flow position for client funds obligations reflected in fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 the net cash inflow position in those years is the result of growth in average client funds held the slight decrease in net cash inflows for fiscal 2015 was the result of lower cash collections for state unemployment insurance with many states lowering their rates early in calendar 2015 

dividends paid   in july 201 5  the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 11  to 0 42 per share from 03 8 per share in july 2014  the board increased our quarter ly dividend to stockholders by 9  to 03 8 per share from 03 5 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 8 0  82 and 81 for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

repurchases of common shares in may 2014 the board approved a program to repurchase up to 350 million of paychex common stock with authorization expiring in may 2017 under this share repurchase program we repurchased 22 million shares for a total of 1079 million during fiscal 2016 and 39 million shares for a total of 1824 million during fiscal 2015  in fiscal 2014  we repurchased 62 million shares for a total of 2497 million under a previously authorized program to repurchase up to 350 million of paychex common stock with authorization for that program expiring in may 2014 

equity activity related to stockbased awards   the decrease in activity related to st ockbased awards for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was largely driven by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options shares of c ommon stock acquired through the exercise of stock options were 09 million shares 16 million shares and 34 million shares for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively refer to note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation plans

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of th is form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed fees earned for funding of temporary staffing clients’ payrolls via purchase of accounts receivable are based on a percentage of funding amounts as specified in the client contract the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

 

for certain of our service offerings we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients we defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the related costs recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of clients 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct passthrough costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes and certain benefit premiums d irect costs related to certain benefit plans where the company retains risk are classified as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

peo insurance reserves as part of the peo service we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees workers compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance carrier workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits in establishing the peo workers compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly workers compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier under the minimum premium arrangement our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any combination of new and adverse or favorable trends 

goodwill and other intangible assets   goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit we performed our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter a quantitative analysis was performed for our german reporting unit for all other reporting units we utilized a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit had declined below its carrying value the assessment considered various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors based on the results of our testing no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2016 2015 or 2014 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance  

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note e of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain sto ckbased awards at the time nonqualified stock options are exercised or stock awards vest we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficiency in tax benefits that fall short of the related deferred tax asset related to stockbased awards 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note j of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions  

 




 ite m 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds that are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds  along with us government agency securities and corporate bonds  we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 201 6  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts vrdns   highquality commercial paper and   government agency discount notes  we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 201 6  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 1 1  compared   to 10 for fiscal years 201 5 and 201 4  when interest rates are rising the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a rising interest rate environment earnings increase from our shortterm investments and over time increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 201 6 had an average duration of 3 1 years would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 201 6 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal funds rate was raised by 25 basis points in december 2015 and has been in the range of 025 to 050 since then previously the federal funds rate had remained at a range of zero to 025 since december 2008  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

• daily interest rate changes 

• seasonal variations in investment balances 

• actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale securities 

• the proportion of taxable and taxexempt investments 

• changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous and 

 

• financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 35 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 5 0 billion for fiscal 201 6  our anticipated allocation is approximately 45 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 55 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 476 million as of may 31 201 6  compared with an unrealized gain of  136 million as of may 31 20 15  refer to note g of the notes to co nsolidated financial statements contai ned in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 201 6  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from  3  7 million to  72  2 million during fiscal 201 5 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfo lios ranged from an unrealized gain of 95 million to 559 million the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately  635 as of july 15 2016 

as of may 31 201 6 and 201 5  we had  4  1 billion and 36 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 17 and 16 as of may 31 201 6 and 201 5  respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsa le securities as of may 31 2016  would be in the range of 200 million to 250 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 201 6 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while  155  6 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized losses of  0  7 million were due to changes in interest rates and were not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns a significant portion of these securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 201 6 and 201 5 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment  

we have some credit risk exposure in connection with our purchase of accounts receivable as a means of providing funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry this credit risk exposure is diversified amongst multiple client arrangements and all such arrangements are regularly reviewed for potential writeoff no single client is material in respect to total accounts receivable service revenue or results of operations

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 10 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those businesses greater than 99 have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market the average client size within our existing client base is approximately 17 employees we believe that there is opportunity for us in the hcm market as the demand is moving downmarket to smaller businesses 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany revenue from operations in germany and longlived assets in germany are not material we also have a jointventure arrangement to provide payroll and human resource services in brazil we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for the fiscal year ended may 31 2015 “fiscal 2015” client retention reached record levels rising to over 82 of our beginning of the year client base no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly fewer clients than us in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors hrs products also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offerings and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas we believe that our excellent customer service together with our leadingedge technology and mobility applications distinguishes us from our competitors 

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace we continue to enhance our saas solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in that quarter

risk factors 

tableend

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our clients and our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform the act was enacted in march 2010 and entails sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018 many provisions of the act require the issuance of additional guidance from the us departments of labor and health  human services the internal revenue service the “irs” and the states 

as a service provider we have a responsibility to our clients to help them understand their increased obligations under the federal and state regulations facing employers under the act failure to provide clients with appropriate information or solutions to effectively manage their health care benefits and related costs could have an adverse impact on our reputation and a negative impact on our client base there is no guarantee that solutions we have developed to help clients navigate health care legislation will continue to be readily accepted by clients which could have a material adverse impact on our insurance services business insurance services revenue is at risk for lower commission revenue from underwriters if clients move away from traditional insurance policies utilized in the past or as a result of pressure on commission rates driven by restrictions on insurers as to use of premiums refer to the discussion on the next page regarding changes in health insurance and workers compensation insurance rates and underlying claim trends for discussion of health care reform as it impacts our peo 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

our business and reputation may be affected by security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure which could compromise company and personal customer information we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes if we experience a problem with the functioning of key systems or a security breach of our systems the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we also collect use and retain large amounts of personal information about our clients and their employees that is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients this information includes bank account numbers credit card numbers tax return information social security numbers health care information retirement account information payroll information and paychex system passwords in addition we also collect and maintain personal information on our employees in the ordinary course of our business as many of our services are webbased and mobileapplicationbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information however there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claim experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claim activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have rarely borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

our fiscal 2016  guidance is as follows 



operating income net of certain items as a percent of total service revenue is expected to be approximately 38  for fiscal 2016  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016  is expected to be consistent with that experienced in fiscal 2015

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue was 17 billion  for fiscal 2015  and 16 billion  for fiscal 2014  reflecting growth of 4  compared to each of the respective prior fiscal year periods both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  benefited from increases in revenue per check and clients in addition fiscal 2014  revenue benefited from an increase in checks per payroll growth in checks per payroll was flat for fiscal 2015  revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases and increased product penetration partially offset by discounting during the fiscal year 

for fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  our total payroll client base growth was approximately 2  client retention reached record levels for both years and was in excess of   82  of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2015  and was approximately   82  of the beginning of the year client base for fiscal 2014  

human resource services revenue hrs revenue was 10 billion  for fiscal 2015  and 8789 million  for fiscal 2014  reflecting growth of 18  compared to each of the respective prior fiscal year periods this growth was positively impacted by the minimum premium plan health insurance offering for our peo clients and their employees which was introduced in the second half of fiscal 2014  this product offering contributed six percentage points of the fiscal 2015  growth in hrs revenue compared to three percentage points for fiscal 2014  

for both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  the growth in hrs revenue was attributable to client base growth as reflected in the table below the most significant of these contributors are as follows 

 hrs product key statistics are as follows 



total service revenue total service revenue increased 9  for fiscal 2015  and 8  for fiscal 2014  attributable to the factors previously discussed 

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients increased 3  for fiscal 2015  after decreasing 1  for fiscal 2014  for fiscal 2015  the increase was primarily due to an increase in average investment balances while average interest rates earned were flat for fiscal 2014  the decline was the result of lower average interest rates earned partially offset by an increase in average investment balances the lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2014  were the result of lower yields on high quality financial instruments 

average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 3  for fiscal 2015  and 4  for fiscal 2014  the increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2015  was mainly driven by increases in client base and wage inflation the increase for fiscal 2014  was largely due to the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on december 31 2012 which resulted in higher employee social security withholdings along with increases in checks per payroll and client base and wage inflation 

refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and sga expenses for fiscal years 



 total expenses increased 10  for fiscal 2015  and 8  for fiscal 2014  both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  were impacted by costs relating to the new minimum premium plan health insurance offering within our peo which contributed three percentage points of the increase in total expenses for fiscal 2015  and two percentage points for fiscal 2014  

the increases in total expenses were driven largely by growth in compensationrelated expenses for fiscal 2015  compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher sales headcount and variable costs resulting from strong sales execution along with higher employeebenefitrelated costs primarily medical expenses for fiscal 2014  compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher wages and performancebased compensation costs the increase in wages was largely related to investments in product development and supporting technology as well as sales force investment initiatives that began in fiscal 2013 as of may 31 2015  we had approximately 13000  employees compared with 12700  employees as of may 31 2014  

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business the higher growth rate for fiscal 2014  was related to additional internally developed software related to our leadingedge cloudbased platform that was placed in service during the year amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods 

other expenses include items such as noncapital equipment delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business other expenses increased due to costs relating to the new minimum premium plan health care offering in the peo in addition continued investment in product development and supporting technology impacted other expense growth for both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  

operating income operating income increased 7  for fiscal 2015  and 9  for fiscal 2014  the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 



1   operating income net of certain items is a nongaap measure refer to further discussion under nongaap financial measure discussion that follows 

operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue was approximately 38  for each of the fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  operating income net of certain items for fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  was impacted by the growth in the minimum premium plan within the peo this product offering is a lowermargin product 

nongaap financial measure in addition to reporting operating income a us generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue investment income net increased 17  for fiscal 2015  as the result of an increase in average investment balances while interest rates earned remained relatively flat investment income decreased 18  for fiscal 2014  as a result of lower average interest rates earned on investments partially offset by an increase in average investment balances average investment balances increased 4  for fiscal 2015  and 17  for fiscal 2014  the increases were the result of investment of cash generated from operations the lower rate of growth in average investment balances for fiscal 2015 is the result of cash outflows for stock repurchases in fiscal 2015 and the later half of fiscal 2014 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 363  for fiscal 2015  compared to 365  for fiscal 2014  and 376  for fiscal 2013  the higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  was the result of the settlement of a state income tax matter refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and earnings per share net income increased 8  to 6749 million  for fiscal 2015  and 10  to 6275 million  for fiscal 2014  diluted earnings per share increased 8  to 185  per share for fiscal 2015  and 10  to 171 per share for fiscal 2014  these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed the growth rates for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the settlement of a state income tax matter which reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately 004 per share for fiscal 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of may 31 2015  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 9364 million  and no debt we believe that our investments as of may 31 2015  were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2015  along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases business acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations 

lines of credit as of may 31 2015  we had unused borrowing capacity available under uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 



our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2015  or as of may 31 2015  

certain of the financial institutions are also parties to our credit facility and irrevocable standby letters of credit which are discussed below 

credit facility  in june 2013 we entered into a committed unsecured fiveyear syndicated credit facility expiring on june 21 2018 under the credit facility paychex of new york llp the “borrower” may subject to certain restrictions borrow up to 750 million  to meet shortterm funding requirements in july 2014 supplemental agreements were executed increasing the maximum borrowing capacity under the facility from 500 million  to 750 million  the obligations under this facility have been guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries the outstanding obligations under this credit facility will bear interest at competitive rates to be elected by the borrower upon expiration of the commitment in june 2018 any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date 

there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility as of may 31 2015  during fiscal 2015  we borrowed against this facility for one day each as follows 



certain lenders under this credit facility and their respective affiliates have performed and may in the future perform for us and our subsidiaries various commercial banking investment banking underwriting and other financial advisory services for which they have received and will continue to receive in the future customary fees and expenses 

letters of credit as of may 31 2015  we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 430 million  required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2015 and april 2016  and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2015  or as of may 31 2015  subsequent to may 31 2015  the letter of credit expiring in july 2015 was renewed through july 2016 

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2015  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2015

the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 291 million  as of may 31 2015  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 624 million  are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services ®  and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years arrangements with some associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  was 151 million  144 million  and 126 million  respectively 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2015  

operating cash flow activities 



the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  is primarily the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items partially offset by the impact of fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items along with the positive impact from fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments to net income increased for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 compared to the respective prior year periods largely due to higher amortization of premiums on availableforsale securities as the company has increased its holdings of longerduration investments and higher stockbased compensation costs the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities income taxes contributed significantly to the fluctuations as a result of a higher prepaid income tax position as of may 31 2013 that arose from the federal benefit on the settlement of a state tax matter during fiscal 2013 

investing cash flow activities 



funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities are largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014 there was not a significant fluctuation due to timing of the day of the week for fiscal yearend the net cash outflow position for both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014 is related to more purchases of shortterm and availableforsale securities resulting from higher average collections from clients for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 there was a significant timing impact there was a large cash outflow on friday may 31 2013 that required the liquidation of funds held in the funds held for clients portfolio this resulted in positive cash flow from investing activities for fiscal 2013 see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations our net cash inflow from funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2013 was partially offset by higher purchases than sales of vrdn securities during the year 

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

other investing activities to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  we purchased approximately 69 million  47 million  and 65 million  respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

during fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  we paid net of cash acquired 271 million  93 million  and 213 million  respectively for immaterial business acquisitions 

financing cash flow activities 



net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

fluctuations in net change in client fund obligations for the years presented are primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances and overall trends in client fund balances may 31 2015 fell on a sunday may 31 2014 fell on a saturday and may 31 2013 fell on a friday friday is a large cash outflow day for direct deposit funds partially offset by tax payment funds collected on that day this impact was consistent and did not impact the net cash flow position for client funds obligations reflected in fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014 the net cash inflow position in those years is the result of growth in average client funds held the slight decrease in net cash inflows for fiscal 2015 was the result of lower cash collections for state unemployment insurance with many states lowering their rates early in calendar 2015 

timing did have an impact for fiscal 2013 resulting in a net cash outflow position may 31 2012 was a thursday a large cash collection day for direct deposit funds so we had higher client funds on hand at that date as may 31 2013 was a friday and a cash outflow day for direct deposit client funds on hand were lower as a result there was a net cash outflow over the period in fiscal 2013 

dividends paid   in july 2014 the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 9 to 038 per share from 035 per share in july 2013 the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 6 to 035 per share from 033 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 82  81  and 84  for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

repurchases of common shares in may 2014 the board approved a program to repurchase up to 350 million  of paychex common stock with authorization expiring in may 2017 during fiscal 2015  we repurchased 39 million  shares for a total of 1824 million  in fiscal 2014 we repurchased 62 million  shares for a total of 2497 million  under a previously authorized program to purchase up to 350 million  of paychex common stock with authorization for that program expiring in may 2014 

equity activity related to stockbased awards the decrease in activity related to stockbased awards for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  was largely driven by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options the increase in activity for stockbased awards for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was driven by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options common shares acquired through the exercise of stock options were 16 million shares 34 million  shares and 24 million  shares for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation plans

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

for certain of our service offerings we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients we defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the related costs recognizing the revenue and related expenses over the expected life of clients 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct passthrough costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes and certain benefit premiums in fiscal 2014 with the addition of a new health care offering within the peo direct costs related to certain benefit plans where the company retains risk were classified as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

peo insurance reserves as part of the peo service we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees workers compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance carrier workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly workers compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier under the minimum premium arrangement our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value this assessment considers various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our reviews no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2015  2014  or 2013  subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of nonqualified stock options are exercised or stock awards vest we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficiency in tax benefits that fall short of the related deferred tax asset related to stockbased awards 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds that are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest primarily in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2015  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and vrdns we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2015  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 10  comparable the average interest rate earned for fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  when interest rates are rising the full impact of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a rising interest rate environment earnings increase from our shortterm investments and over time increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2015  had an average duration of 32  years would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2015  are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 



vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal funds rate remained at a range of zero to 025 throughout fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 27 

 subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 35 million  to 40 million  after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 51 billion  for fiscal 2015  our anticipated allocation is approximately 45 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 55 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 136 million  as of may 31 2015  compared with an unrealized gain of 345 million  as of may 31 2014  refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value measurements 

during fiscal 2015  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 95 million  to 559 million  during fiscal 2014  the net unrealized gainloss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized loss of 128 million  to an unrealized gain of 427 million  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 209 million  as of july 16 2015  

as of may 31 2015  and 2014  we had 36 billion  and 34 billion  respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 16  as of may 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical increase in longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2015  would be in the range of 200 million  to 250 million  conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2015  were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 9230 million  of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized losses of 75 million  was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns a substantial portion of these securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2015  and 2014  held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve industry data indicates there are approximately 12 million businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those businesses greater than 99 have fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and target market 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany we also have a jointventure arrangement to provide payroll and human resource services in brazil we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for fiscal 2014  client retention reached record levels rising to approximately 82  of our beginning client base no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the composition of the us market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows 



  

 the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offerings and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas we believe that our excellent customer service together with our leadingedge technology distinguishes us from our competitors 

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

we continue to enhance our paychex next generation platform with its suite of innovative products as we believe it is a key building block to our future success we also continue to add more capabilities to our mobile applications 

employees 

as of may 31 2014  we employed approximately 12700 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

intellectual property 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in that quarter

risk factors 

tableend

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect possibly to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our clients and our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform the act was enacted in march 2010 and entails sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018 many provisions of the act require the issuance of additional guidance from the us departments of labor and health  human services the internal revenue service the “irs” and the states 

the complexity of federal and state regulations facing employers has continued to increase over time including the enactment of the act as a service provider we have a responsibility to our clients to help them understand their increased obligations under such regulations failure to provide clients with appropriate information or solutions to effectively manage their health care benefits and related costs could have an adverse impact on our reputation and a negative impact on our client base there is no guarantee that solutions we have developed to help clients navigate health care legislation will be readily accepted by clients which could have a material adverse impact on our insurance services business insurance services revenue is at risk for lower commission revenue from underwriters if clients move away from traditional insurance policies utilized in the past or as a result of pressure on commission rates driven by restrictions on insurers as to use of premiums refer to the discussion on the next page regarding changes in health insurance and workers compensation insurance rates and underlying claims trends for discussion of health care reform as it impacts our peo 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

our business and reputation may be affected by security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure which could compromise company and personal customer information we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes if we experience a problem with the functioning of key systems or a security breach of our systems the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we also collect use and retain large amounts of personal information about our clients and their employees that is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients this information includes bank account numbers credit card numbers tax return information social security numbers health care information retirement account information payroll information and paychex system passwords in addition we also collect and maintain personal information on our employees in the ordinary course of our business as many of our services are webbased and mobileapplicationbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information however there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with clients provide that they will indemnify us for any liability attributable to their own or their employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies could adversely impact this interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings historically we have rarely borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations

with the introduction of a new health insurance offering within our peo during fiscal 2014 we began classifying peo direct costs related to certain benefit plans where the company retains risk as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue this change referred to as the peo direct cost adjustment throughout this discussion had no impact on operating income refer to the results of operations section of this item 7 and note o to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further details on the impact to service revenue total revenue and operating expenses in evaluating hrs revenue we historically have considered the peo revenue net of these direct costs

nongaap financial measure 

in addition to reporting operating income a united states “us” generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

business outlook 

our client base totaled approximately 580000  clients as of may 31 2014  compared to approximately 570000  clients as of may 31 2013  and approximately 567000  clients as of may 31 2012  our client base increased approximately 2  for fiscal 2014  compared to approximately 1  for both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012

financial position and liquidity 

our financial position as of may 31 2014  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 9368 million  and no debt 

our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity yields on high quality financial instruments remain low negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments we invest predominately in municipal bonds including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds that are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds during fiscal 2014  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were high quality variable rate demand notes “vrdns” and bank demand deposit accounts 

a substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we believe that our investments as of may 31 2014  were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment 

our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 8809 million  for fiscal 2014  historically we have funded our operations capital purchases business acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments from our operating activities our positive cash flows in fiscal 2014  allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2014  dividends paid to stockholders were 81  of net income it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2014  along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases business acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  and our financial position as of may 31 2014  refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

outlook 

our outlook for the fiscal year ending may 31 2015  “ fiscal 2015 ” is based upon current market economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes our expected fiscal 2015  payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check hrs revenue and total service revenue growth reflect the change to classify certain peo direct costs as operating expenses and not as a reduction in service revenue 

our fiscal 2015  guidance is as follows 



operating income net of certain items as a percent of total service revenue is expected to be in the range of 37  to 38  for fiscal 2015  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015  is expected to be consistent with that experienced in fiscal 2014 

interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2015  is expected to be relatively flat as it continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment with funds reinvested at lower yields the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be 09  for fiscal 2015  as of may 31 2014  the longterm investment portfolio had an average yieldtomaturity of 16  and an average duration of 30  years in the next twelve months approximately 15  of this portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at an interest rate of approximately 16  investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations 

purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2015  are expected to be in the range of 110 million  to 120 million  this includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our service supporting technology fiscal 2015  depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of 95 million  to 100 million  and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2015  to be in the range of 15 million  to 20 million  

results of operations 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

with the introduction of a new health insurance offering within the peo during fiscal 2014 we began classifying peo direct costs related to certain benefit plans where we retain risk as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue this had no impact on operating income the amounts reported for service revenue total revenue and combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses reflect this gross presentation 

in addition to reporting the peo revenue on a gross basis within hrs revenue as described above a gaap measure we use an hrs net revenue presentation which is a nongaap measure to provide an additional view of our performance we believe hrs net revenue provides useful information as a measure of our revenue eliminating the cost of services provided and on a consistent basis we use hrs net revenue in evaluating our operating results on a comparative basis to identify trends in our business and in evaluating the effectiveness of our business strategies hrs net revenue is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the sec as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

had the direct costs of certain benefit plans been reported as a reduction in service revenue the following would have been reflected for fiscal 2014 



  

we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2014  we had no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments and had insignificant exposure to european investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 



 19 

 payroll service revenue payroll service revenue was 16 billion  for fiscal 2014  and 15 billion  for fiscal 2013  reflecting growth of 4  and 2  respectively compared to the prior fiscal year periods both fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  revenue benefited from increases in revenue per check client base and checks per payroll revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases partially offset by discounting together with increased product penetration for fiscal 2014  our total payroll client base growth was approximately 2  compared to 1 for both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  checks per payroll have increased for seventeen consecutive quarters payroll service revenue for fiscal 2013  was modestly affected by the impact of hurricane sandy in the fall of 2012 and one less payroll processing day overall due to the leap year in fiscal 2012 client retention reached record levels for fiscal 2014  at approximately 82  of the beginning of the year client base compared to exceeding 81 of the beginning of the year client base in the prior year 

human resource services revenue hrs revenue was 8789 million  for fiscal 2014  and 7460 million  for fiscal 2013  reflecting growth of 18  and 10  respectively compared to the prior fiscal year excluding the impact of the peo direct cost adjustment hrs revenue would have increased 12 for fiscal 2014  

 the growth for fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  in hrs revenue was driven primarily by client base growth particularly in paychex hr services retirement services and online hr administration products our online hr administration products contributed to growth through sales success for saas solutions the most significant contributors all of which increased by high single or low doubledigit percentages are as follows 

 hrs product key statistics are as follows 



total service revenue total service revenue increased 8  for fiscal 2014  and 5  for fiscal 2013  attributable to the factors previously discussed excluding the impact of the peo direct costs adjustment service revenue would have increased 6  for fiscal 2014  

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients decreased 1  for fiscal 2014  and 6  for fiscal 2013  compared to the respective prior year periods these declines were the result of lower average interest rates earned partially offset by an increase in average investment balances the lower average interest rates were the result of lower yields on high quality financial instruments for fiscal 2013  the average interest rate earned was also impacted by the mix of investments in the shortterm portfolio with more invested in taxexempt securities taxexempt securities typically earn a lower pretax rate of return but are expected to generate lower income tax expense on interest earned 

average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 4  for both fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  the increase for fiscal 2014  was largely due to the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on december 31 2012 which resulted in higher employee social security withholdings in addition the average investment balances for both fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  benefited from increases in checks per payroll and client base and wage inflation 

refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and sga expenses for fiscal years 



 total expenses increased 8  for fiscal 2014  and 3  for fiscal 2013  excluding the peo direct cost adjustment growth in total expenses for fiscal 2014  would have been 5  the increases in total expenses were primarily in compensationrelated expenses for fiscal 2014  compensationrelated expenses increased due to higher wages and performancebased compensation costs the increase in wages was largely related to investments in product development and supporting technology as well as sales force investment initiatives that began in fiscal 2013 for fiscal 2013  compensationrelated expenses were impacted by increased headcount in areas supporting our development of technology and higher employee benefitrelated costs partially offset by the impact of improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount as of may 31 2014  we had approximately 12700  employees compared with 12400  employees as of both may 31 2013  and may 31 2012  

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business the higher growth rate for fiscal 2014  was related to additional internally developed software related to our paychex next generation platform that was placed in service during the year amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods 

other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment equipment costs professional services and other costs incurred to support our business higher equipment costs within information technology and higher professional services supporting our technology development contributed to the increases in other expenses for both fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  

operating income operating income increased 9  for fiscal 2014  and 6  for fiscal 2013  the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 



 refer to the previous discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “nongaap financial measure” section on page 16 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue investment income net decreased 18  for fiscal 2014  and increased 4  for fiscal 2013  the decrease in investment income net for fiscal 2014  was the result of lower average interest rates earned on investments partially offset by an increase in average investment balances the increase in investment income for fiscal 2013  was primarily the result of higher average investment balances average investment balances increased 17  for fiscal 2014  and 10  for fiscal 2013  the increases were the result of investment of cash generated from operations 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 365  for fiscal 2014  compared to 376  for fiscal 2013  and 363  for fiscal 2012  the higher effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  was the result of the settlement of a state income tax matter refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and earnings per share net income increased 10  to 6275 million  for fiscal 2014  and 4  to 5690 million  for fiscal 2013  diluted earnings per share increased 10  to 171  per share for fiscal 2014  and 3  to 156 per share for fiscal 2013  these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed the settlement of a state income tax matter reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately 004 per share for fiscal 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

our financial position as of may 31 2014  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 9368 million  and no debt we believe that our investments as of may 31 2014  were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2014  along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases business acquisitions share repurchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations 

lines of credit as of may 31 2014  we had unused borrowing capacity available under uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 



our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2014  or as of may 31 2014  

certain of the financial institutions are also parties to our credit facility and irrevocable standby letters of credit which are discussed below 

credit facility  in june 2013 we entered into a committed unsecured fiveyear syndicated credit facility expiring on june 21 2018 under the credit facility paychex of new york llp the “borrower” may subject to certain restrictions borrow up to 500 million to meet shortterm funding requirements the obligations under this facility have been guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries the outstanding obligations under this credit facility will bear interest at competitive rates to be elected by the borrower upon expiration of the commitment in june 2018 any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date 

there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility as of may 31 2014  during fiscal 2014  we borrowed against this facility for one day each as follows 



certain lenders under this credit facility and their respective affiliates have performed and may in the future perform for us and our subsidiaries various commercial banking investment banking underwriting and other financial advisory services for which they have received and will continue to receive in the future customary fees and expenses 

letters of credit as of may 31 2014  we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 430 million  required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2014 and april 2015  and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2014  or as of may 31 2014  subsequent to may 31 2014  the letter of credit expiring in july 2014  was renewed at the same terms and amount and will expire in july 2015  

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2014  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2014  



 the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and net of federal benefits was approximately 298 million  as of may 31 2014  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 566 million  are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years arrangements with some associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  was 144 million  126 million  and 117 million  respectively 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material and are not material as of the reporting date we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threats and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2014  

operating cash flow activities 



the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  is primarily the result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items and fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  resulted mainly from fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher net income adjusted for noncash items noncash adjustments to net income increased for both years driven largely by higher amortization of premiums on availableforsale securities as the company has increased its holdings of longerduration investments the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities income taxes contributed significantly to these fluctuations as a result of a higher prepaid income tax position as of may 31 2013 that arose from the federal benefit on the settlement of a state tax matter during fiscal 2013 

investing cash flow activities 



funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

the fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities is largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio for fiscal 2014  there was not a significant fluctuation due to timing of fiscal yearends the net cash outflow for fiscal 2014  is related to more purchases of shortterm and availableforsale securities resulting from higher average collections from clients for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 there was a significant timing impact there was a large cash outflow on friday may 31 2013  that required the liquidation of funds held in the funds held for clients shortterm cash equivalents portion of the portfolio resulting in positive cash flow from investing activities for fiscal 2013  there was a large inflow of collections on thursday may 31 2012 that was invested primarily in shortterm investments on that date reflecting a large cash outflow from investing activities for fiscal 2012 see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations our net cash inflow from funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2013  was partially offset by higher purchases than sales of vrdn securities during the year 

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

purchases of longlived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  we purchased approximately 47 million  65 million  and 26 million  respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

during fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  we paid net of cash acquired 93 million  213 million  and 60 million  respectively for immaterial business acquisitions 

financing cash flow activities 



net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

the fluctuations in net change in client fund obligations for the years presented is primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances may 31 2014  fell on a saturday and may 31 2013  fell on a friday friday is a large cash outflow day for direct deposit funds partially offset by tax payment funds collected on that day therefore timing did not impact the net change in client obligations for fiscal 2014 may 31 2012  fell on a thursday which is a large collection day for direct pay funds these funds were then paid out on friday june 1 2012 therefore timing is the primary reason for the fluctuation in these amounts for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 in addition the fluctuations were impacted by overall trends in client fund balances which were 4  higher on average for fiscal 2014  than fiscal 2013  and 4  higher on average for fiscal 2013  than for fiscal 2012  

dividends paid in july 2013 the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 6 to 035 per share from 033 per share in october 2012 the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 3 to 033 per share from 032 per share in october 2011 the board increased our quarterly dividend by 3 to 032 per share from 031 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 81  84  and 84  for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

repurchases of common shares  in october 2012 the board approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to 350 million  of paychex common stock with authorization for this program expiring in may 2014 during fiscal 2014  we repurchased 62 million  shares for a total of 2497 million  in may 2014 the board approved a new program to repurchase up to 350 million  of paychex common stock with authorization expiring in may 2017 

equity activity related to stockbased awards the increase in activity related to stockbased awards for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was largely driven by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 34 million  shares 24 million  shares and 02 million  shares for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation plans

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

for certain of our service offerings we receive advance payments for setup fees from our clients we defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the related costs over the expected life of clients 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of certain direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes and certain benefit premiums in fiscal 2014 with the addition of a new health care offering within the peo direct costs related to certain benefit plans where the company retains risk were classified as operating expenses rather than as a reduction in service revenue 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

peo insurance services as part of the peo service we offer workers’ compensation insurance and health insurance to client companies for the benefit of client employees workers compensation insurance is provided under a fully insured high deductible workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance carrier workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims up to per occurrence liability limits in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly workers compensation final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

with respect to our peo health insurance we offer various health insurance plans that take the form of either fully insured fixed cost plans with various national insurance carriers or a fully insured minimum premium insurance arrangement with coverage provided through a single national carrier under the minimum premium arrangement our health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the payment of claims liability charges in accordance with our service contract with the carrier the claims liability charges include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value this assessment considers various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our reviews no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2014  2013  or 2012  subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our stockbased compensation plans 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess of the tax benefit over the deferred tax asset as an increase to additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficiency in tax benefits that fall short of the related deferred tax asset related to stockbased awards 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions will be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds that are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

during fiscal 2014  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were vrdns and bank demand deposit accounts we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities subprime mortgage securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2014  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 10  compared with 10  for fiscal 2013  and 11  for fiscal 2012  when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2014  had an average duration of 30  years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates in the next twelve months approximately 15  of our availableforsale portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 16  

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2014  are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 



vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal funds rate remained at a range of zero to 025 throughout fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 45 million  after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 48 billion  for fiscal 2014  our anticipated allocation is approximately 45 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 55 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and threequarters years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 345 million  as of may 31 2014  compared with an unrealized gain of 347 million  as of may 31 2013  refer to note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on fair value 

during fiscal 2014  the net unrealized gainloss on our investment portfolios ranged from an unrealized loss of 128 million  to an unrealized gain of 427 million  during fiscal 2013  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 347 million  to 641 million  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 269 million  as of july 16 2014  

as of may 31 2014  and 2013  we had 34 billion  and 37 billion  respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 16  and 18  as of may 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns assuming a hypothetical decrease in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2014  would be approximately 200 million  conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2014  were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 3952 million  of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized loss of 30 million  was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2014  and 2013  held an aa rating or better we do not currently intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

in fiscal 2013 we added new territories and focused on market segmentation in payroll and retirement services within payroll we differentiate the markets we serve between the small business market and midmarket companies within retirement services we expanded our sales efforts by creating a dedicated wholesale sales force focused solely on enhancing our relationships with financial advisors 

in addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts we utilize relationships with existing clients certified public accountants “cpas” and banks for new client referrals approximately 60 of our new core payroll clients excluding business acquisitions come from these referral sources 

we recently celebrated the ten year anniversary of our partnership with the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” as the preferred payroll provider for its aicpa business solutions tm  program more than half of the cpa firms in the us are enrolled and actively participating in the paychex partner program from aicpa business solutions our current partnership agreement with the aicpa is in place through september 2016 we enhanced our relationships with cpas by partnering with various state cpa society organizations in addition we recently created a dedicated business development group to drive sales in the banking and franchise channels

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve industry data indicates there are approximately 12 million businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those businesses greater than 99 have fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and target market 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for fiscal 2013  client retention reached record levels in excess of 81 of our beginning client base no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the composition of the us market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows 



  

 the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation including ease of use and accessibility of technology breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

we continue to enhance our paychex next generation platform with its suite of innovative products as we believe it is a key building block to our future success we also continue to add more capabilities to our mobility applications 

employees 

as of may 31 2013  we employed approximately 12400 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr solutions worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in the third quarter

risk factors 

tableend

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our clients and our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform the ppaca was enacted on march 23 2010 and was subsequently modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 on march 30 2010 together with ppaca hereafter referred to as the “act” the act entails sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 

2010 through 2018 and many provisions of the act require the issuance of additional guidance from the us departments of labor and heath  human services the internal revenue service the “irs” and the states 

the complexity of federal and state regulations facing employers has continued to increase over time including the enactment of the act as a service provider we have a responsibility to our clients to help them understand these increased regulations failure to provide clients with appropriate information or solutions to effectively manage their health care benefits and related costs could have an adverse impact on our reputation and a negative impact on our client base there is no guarantee that solutions we have developed to help clients navigate health care legislation will be readily accepted by clients which could have a material adverse impact on our insurance services business insurance services revenue is at risk for lower commission revenue from underwriters if clients move away from traditional insurance policies utilized in the past or as a result of pressure on commission rates driven by restrictions on insurers as to use of premiums refer to the discussion below regarding changes in health insurance and workers compensation insurance rates and underlying claims trends for discussion of health care reform as it impacts our peo 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

our business and reputation may be affected by security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure which could compromise company and personal customer information we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes if we experience a problem with the functioning of key systems or a security breach of our systems the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we also collect use and retain large amounts of personal information about our clients and their employees that is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients this information includes bank account numbers credit card numbers tax return information social security numbers health care information retirement account information payroll information and paychex system passwords in addition we also collect and maintain personal information on our employees in the ordinary course of our business as many of our services are webbased and mobileapplicationbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data we have security systems and information technology infrastructure in place designed to detect and protect against unauthorized access to such information however there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches third parties including vendors that provide services for our operations could also be a source of security risk to us in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure 

if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulatory investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including hurricanes floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their 

employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo direct costs if we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms also as a coemployer in the peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities associated with health care reform which may result in increased costs increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings we historically have not borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations

our hrs products include 

 our primary goal is to transform the way businesses do business we strive to achieve this goal by leveraging our industryleading technology to provide outstanding customer service our business strategy is focused on strong longterm financial performance by providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technology through our service organization and expanding our product offerings we continue to focus on driving growth in clients revenue and profits we are managing our personnel costs and expenses while continuing to invest in our business particularly in leadingedge technology we believe these investments are critical to our success looking to the future we continue to focus on investing in our products people and service capabilities positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for longterm growth 

our financial results for fiscal 2013  reflected sustained growth in our business checks per payroll and revenue per check continued to show improvement checks per payroll grew 16  for fiscal 2013  slightly less than the 20  growth experienced for fiscal 2012  our service execution was strong as we achieved our highest levels of customer satisfaction in our history and record levels of client retention 

our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment as interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remain low the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to 025 since december 2008 our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 10  for fiscal 2013  compared to 11  for fiscal 2012  and 13  for fiscal 2011  

highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  are as follows 

 

nongaap financial measure 

in addition to reporting operating income a united states “us” generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

business outlook 

our client base totaled approximately 570000  clients as of may 31 2013  compared to approximately 567000  clients as of may 31 2012  and approximately 564000 clients as of may 31 2011  our client base increased approximately 1  for fiscal 2013  compared to approximately 1 for fiscal 2012 and approximately 5 1 decline on an organic basis for fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2013  payroll services client retention was at record levels exceeding 81 of our beginning client base we received the highest client satisfaction results in our history which we believe is a result of our focus on providing highquality service to our customers utilizing leadingedge technology to maximize client retention 

our ancillary services provide services to employers and employees beyond payroll but effectively leverage payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin eservices ancillary services are often included as part of the saas solutions for midmarket clients the following statistics demonstrate the growth in certain of our hrs ancillary service offerings

financial position and liquidity 

the supply of high credit quality securities has been limited with the continued volatility in the global financial markets thereby limiting our investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment our financial position as of may 31 2013  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 8746 million  and no debt 

our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity yields on high quality financial instruments remain low negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments we invest predominately in municipal bonds including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds that are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds during fiscal 2013  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were high quality variable rate demand notes “vrdns” and bank demand deposit accounts 

a substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we believe that our investments as of may 31 2013  were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment 

our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 6753 million  for fiscal 2013  historically we have funded our operations capital purchases business acquisitions and dividend payments from our operating activities our positive cash flows in fiscal 2013  allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2013  dividends paid to stockholders were 84  of net income it is anticipated that cash and total 

corporate investments as of may 31 2013  along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  and our financial position as of may 31 2013  refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

outlook 

our outlook for the fiscal year ending may 31 2014  “ fiscal 2014 ” is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes our expected fiscal 2014  payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check hrs revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our recent organic experience 

our fiscal 2014  guidance is as follows 



we believe that net income growth for fiscal 2014  is expected to benefit from a strong comparison mainly due to results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  we settled a state income tax matter which reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately 004 per share operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38  for fiscal 2014  the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014  is expected to be in the range of 36  to 37  the settlement of a state income tax matter in fiscal 2013  is not expected to have an impact on the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014  

interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2014  are expected to continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to remain at 10  for fiscal 2014  as of may 31 2013  the longterm investment portfolio had an average yieldtomaturity of 18  and an average duration of 31  years in the next twelve months slightly less than 15  of this portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 11  investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations 

purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2014  are expected to be in the range of 100 million  to 110 million  this includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our service supporting technology fiscal 2014  depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of 85 million  to 90 million  and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2014  to be approximately 15 million  

results of operations 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 



we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2013  we had no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments and had insignificant exposure to european investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue increased 2  for fiscal 2013  and 5  for fiscal 2012  to 15 billion  for both periods organic growth in payroll service revenue for fiscal 2012  which excludes the impact of acquisitions during fiscal 2011 was approximately 4 both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  revenue benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check checks per payroll increased 16  and 20  for fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively revenue per check in both periods was positively impacted by price increases partially offset by discounting payroll service revenue for fiscal 2013  was modestly affected by the impact of hurricane sandy in the fall of 2012 and one less payroll processing day overall due to the leap year in fiscal 2012  our client base growth was approximately 1 for both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  client retention reached record levels for fiscal 2013  following a year of further improvement 

human resource services revenue hrs revenue increased 10  for fiscal 2013  and 13  for fiscal 2012  to 7460 million  and 6762 million  respectively the growth rate for fiscal 2012  was impacted by the acquisition of eplan in may 2011 organic growth in hrs revenue was approximately 11 for fiscal 2012  the following factors contributed to the growth for fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  

 hrs product key statistics are as follows 



 total service revenue total service revenue increased 5  for fiscal 2013  and 7  for fiscal 2012  attributable to the factors previously discussed organic service revenue growth was approximately 6 for fiscal 2012 

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients decreased 6  for fiscal 2013  and 9  for fiscal 2012  compared to the respective prior year periods these declines were the result of lower average interest rates earned partially offset by an increase in average investment balances the lower average interest rates were the result of lower yields on high quality financial instruments for fiscal 2013  the average interest rate earned was also impacted by the mix of investments in the shortterm portfolio with more invested in taxexempt securities taxexempt securities typically earn a lower pretax rate of return but are expected to generate lower income tax expense on interest earned 

average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 4  for fiscal 2013  and 7  for fiscal 2012  the increase for fiscal 2013  was largely due to the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on december 31 2012 which resulted in higher employee social security withholdings in addition the average investment balances for fiscal 2013 benefited from increases in checks per payroll and wage inflation the increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2012  was the result of the inclusion of surepayroll client funds wage inflation increase in state unemployment insurance rates and the increase in checks per payroll 

refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for fiscal years 



a significant portion of the increases in expenses for fiscal 2012  was driven by our acquisitions during fiscal 2011 organic growth in combined operating and sga expenses was approximately 3 for fiscal 2012  for both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  continued investment in leadingedge technology contributed to the increases in total expenses with those expenses growing at a faster rate than total expenses improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have moderated these increases 

compensationrelated costs for fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  were impacted by increased headcount in areas supporting our development of technology and higher employee benefitrelated costs fiscal 2013 was also impacted by variable compensation from strong sales execution in the small business market as of both may 31 2013  and 2012  we had approximately 12400 employees 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods depreciation and amortization increased at a higher rate in fiscal 2012  due to business acquisitions 

other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment equipment costs professional services and other costs incurred to support our business the increase in other expenses for fiscal 2012  was primarily attributable to the inclusion of our acquisitions in addition higher equipment costs within information technology and higher professional services supporting our technology development contributed to the increases in other expenses for both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  

operating income operating income increased 6  for fiscal 2013  and 9  for fiscal 2012  the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 



refer to the previous discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “nongaap financial measure” section on page 14 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue investment income increased 4  for fiscal 2013  and 9  for fiscal 2012  the increases in investment income were primarily the result of higher average investment balances average investment balances increased 10  for fiscal 2013  and 4  for fiscal 2012  the increases were the result of investment of cash generated from operations for fiscal 2013  investment income growth was tempered by lower average interest rates earned 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 376  for fiscal 2013  compared to 363  for fiscal 2012  and 350  for fiscal 2011  the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  was the result of the settlement of a state income tax matter the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012  was primarily the result of changes in state apportionment and lower levels of taxexempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and earnings per share net income increased 4  to 5690 million  for fiscal 2013  and 6  to 5480 million  for fiscal 2012  diluted earnings per share increased 3  to 156  per share for fiscal 2013  and 6  to 151 per share for fiscal 2012  these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed the settlement of a state income tax matter impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 004 per share for fiscal 2013  

liquidity and capital resources 

the supply of high credit quality securities has been limited with the continued volatility in the global financial markets thereby limiting our investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment our financial position as of may 31 2013  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 8746 million  and no debt we also believe that our investments as of may 31 2013  were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2013  along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations 

lines of credit as of may 31 2013  we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 



our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2013  or as of may 31 2013  

the financial institutions are also parties to our credit facility and irrevocable standby letters of credit which are discussed below 

credit facility  in june 2013 we entered into a committed unsecured fiveyear syndicated credit facility expiring on june 21 2018 under the credit facility paychex of new york llp the borrower may subject to certain restrictions borrow up to 500 million to meet shortterm funding requirements the obligations under this facility have been guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries the outstanding obligations under this credit facility will bear interest at competitive rates to be elected by the borrower upon expiration of the commitment in june 2018 any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date 

certain lenders under this credit facility and their respective affiliates have performed and may in the future perform for us and our subsidiaries various commercial banking investment banking underwriting and other financial advisory services for which they have received and will continue to receive in the future customary fees and expenses 

letters of credit as of may 31 2013  we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 368 million  required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2013 and december 2013  and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2013  or as of may 31 2013  subsequent to may 31 2013  the letter of credit expiring in july 2013  was renewed and will expire in july 2014  

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2013  the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2013  



  

 the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately 198 million  as of may 31 2013  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 488 million  are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years arrangements with some associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  was 126 million  117 million  and 104 million  respectively 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement cyber threat and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2013  

operating cash flow activities 



the decreases in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  resulted mainly from fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher net income adjusted for noncash items the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

investing cash flow activities 



funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

the fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities is largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio there was a large cash outflow on friday may 31 2013  that required the liquidation of funds held in funds held for clients shortterm cash equivalents portion of the portfolio resulting in positive cash flow from investing activities for fiscal 2013  there was a large inflow of collections on thursday may 31 2012  that was invested primarily in shortterm investments on that date reflecting a large cash outflow from investing activities for fiscal 2012  see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations our net cash inflow from funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2013  was partially offset by higher purchases than sales of vrdn securities during the year for fiscal 2012  the net cash outflow was increased from investment in longerterm availableforsale securities within our corporate portfolio 

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

purchases of longlived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  we purchased approximately 65 million  26 million  and 57 million  respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

during fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  we paid net of cash acquired 213 million  and 60 million  respectively for immaterial business acquisitions during fiscal 2011  we paid 1264 million  for the combined acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan 

financing cash flow activities 



net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

the fluctuations in net change in client fund obligations for the years presented is primarily the result of timing of collections and remittances may 31 2013  fell on a friday which is a large cash outflow day for direct deposit funds partially offset by tax payment funds collected on that day may 31 2012  fell on a thursday which is a large collection day for direct pay funds these funds were then paid out on friday june 1 2012 may 31 2011 fell on a tuesday which is not typically a significant collection or payment day in addition the fluctuations were impacted by overall trends in client fund balances which were 4  higher on average for fiscal 2013  than fiscal 2012  and 7  higher on average for fiscal 2012  than for fiscal 2011  

dividends paid in october 2012 the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 3 to 033 per share from 032 per share in october 2011 the board increased our quarterly dividend by 3 to 032 per share from 031 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 84  84  and 87  for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

equity activity related to stockbased awards the increase in activity related to stockbased awards for fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  was largely driven by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 24 million shares 02 million shares and 04 million shares for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation incentive plans 

other 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

recently issued accounting pronouncements at this time we do not anticipate that recently issued accounting guidance that has not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service 

for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

goodwill and other intangible assets we have 5339 million  and 5174 million  of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2013  and may 31 2012  respectively resulting from acquisitions of businesses the increase in goodwill was due to two immaterial business acquisitions during fiscal 2013  

goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of a reporting unit during fiscal 2012 we adopted guidance that allows us the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value this assessment considers various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors our business is largely homogeneous and as a result goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our reviews no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2013  2012  or 2011  subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stockbased awards 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions must be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position our total reserve for uncertain tax positions was 198 million  as of may 31 2013  and 368 million  as of may 31 2012  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

market risk factors 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we invest predominately in municipal bonds including general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds that are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years 

during fiscal 2013  our primary shortterm investment vehicles were vrdns and bank demand deposit accounts we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities subprime mortgage securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we have insignificant exposure to european investments we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

during fiscal 2013  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 10  compared with 11  for fiscal 2012  and 13  for fiscal 2011  when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsalesecurities which as of may 31 2013  had an average duration of 31  years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates in the next twelve months slightly less than 15 of our available 

forsale portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 11 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2013  are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 



vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal funds rate remained at a range of zero to 025 throughout fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be in the range of 40 million to 45 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 45 billion  for fiscal 2013  our anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three and onehalf years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 347 million  as of may 31 2013  compared with an unrealized gain of 595 million  as of may 31 2012  the decrease was the result of higher market yields experienced near the end of fiscal 2013  in determining fair value we utilize the interactive data pricing service during fiscal 2013  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 347 million  to 641 million  during fiscal 2012  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 464 million to 725 million the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately 27 million  as of july 15 2013  

as of may 31 2013  and 2012  we had 37 billion  and 31 billion  respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 18  and 22  as of may 31 2013  and may 31 2012  respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may 31 2013  and 2012  assuming a hypothetical decrease in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2013  would be in the range of 185 million  to 190 million  conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment 

to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2013  were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 5797 million  of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized loss of 57 million  was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2013  and 2012  held an aa rating or better we do not currently intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

sales and marketing 

we market our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve with sales representatives specializing within our portfolio of services our sales representatives are also supported by marketing advertising public relations trade shows and telemarketing programs in recent years we have increased our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services and products to both new clients and our existing client base 

in addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts we utilize relationships with existing clients certified public accountants “cpas” and banks for new client referrals approximately 60 of our new core payroll clients excluding business acquisitions come from these referral sources to further enhance our strong relationship with cpas we have partnered with the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” since 2003 and through september 2016 as the preferred payroll provider for its aicpa business solutions partner program 

our website at wwwpaychexcom  which includes online payroll sales presentations and service and product information is a costefficient tool that serves as a source of leads and new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales force this online tool allows us to market to clients in other areas in addition our

in addition advantage payroll services inc “advantage” a wholly owned subsidiary of paychex inc has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services the marketing and selling by the associates is conducted under their own logos 

paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the payroll and human resources industry by providing education and assistance to clients and other interested parties we provide free webinars white papers and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes we track current regulatory issues that impact the small business community and provide a monthly regulatory update in an effort to help entrepreneurs and smallbusiness owners achieve success in fiscal 2012 we launched a new website buildmybizcom  that provides tools and resources for starting growing and managing a business 

markets and competition 

we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve industry data indicates there are approximately ten million employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those employers greater than 99 have fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and target market 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany as of may 31 2012 we serviced approximately 567000 payroll clients we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for fiscal 2012 client retention was approximately 80 of our beginning client base up from 79 for fiscal 2011 no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the composition of the us market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows 

 

  

 

 the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

  

software maintenance and development 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

in fiscal 2010 we completed implementation of an enhanced platform for our core payroll processing capability which allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service our paychex next generation platform with its suite of innovative products is expanding these enhancements to our additional service offerings over the next few years 

employees 

as of may 31 2012 we employed approximately 12400 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

intellectual property 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

seasonality 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr solutions worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services at the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in the third quarter

 item 1a risk factors tableend our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business the risks described below are not the only risks we face additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect to a material extent our business cash flows financial condition or results of operations in future periods in addition you should refer to the description of forwardlooking statements at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our clients and our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted on march 23 2010 the ppaca was subsequently modified by the heath care and education reconciliation act of 2010 on march 30 2010 together with ppaca hereafter referred to as the “act” the act entails sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018 and many provisions of the act require the issuance of additional guidance from the us departments of labor and heath  human services the internal revenue service the “irs” and the states 

the complexity of federal and state regulations facing employers has continued to increase over time including the enactment of the act as a service provider we have a responsibility to our clients to help them understand and adapt to these increased regulations however we are currently unable to determine the impacts to our clients and our business of the required plan changes and provisions resulting from the act 

also as a coemployer in our peo we assume or share many of the employerrelated responsibilities and assist our clients in complying with many employmentrelated governmental regulations within this business the changes may result in increased costs limit or delay our ability to increase service fees to offset such increased costs and could affect our ability to attract and retain clients 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

  

our business and reputation may be affected by security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure which could compromise company and customer information we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic information and to support a variety of business processes vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of security measures and constantly updating and adapting security requirements our networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats 

if we experience a problem with the functioning of key systems or a security breach of our systems the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business our business involves the use of significant amounts of private and confidential client information including employees’ identification numbers bank accounts and retirement account information this information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients and certain information may be transmitted via the internet this information could be compromised by a cyber attack there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons both the company and our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulation investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers’ compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business we maintain health and workers’ compensation insurance covering worksite employees the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo direct costs if we experience a sudden and unexpected increase in claims activity our costs could increase in addition in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully could have a material adverse effect incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of 

  

investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings we historically have not borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients

 in addition to the above our softwareasaservice “saas” solution through our mms platform provides human resource management employee benefits management time and attendance systems online expense reporting and applicant tracking 

  

our human resource services primarily include 

 

  

  

  

  

 our business strategy is focused on achieving strong longterm financial performance by providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technology and operating infrastructure and expanding our service offerings we continue to focus on driving growth in clients revenue and profits we are managing our personnel costs and expenses while continuing to invest in our business particularly in areas related to innovation and supporting technology we believe these investments are critical to our success looking to the future we continue to focus on investing in our products people and service capabilities positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for longterm growth 

our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected sustained growth in our business our key business indicators of checks per payroll and revenue per check continued to show improvement checks per payroll grew 20 for fiscal 2012 this growth is slightly less than the growth of 27 for fiscal 2011 as expected our revenue growth has been moderate as new business formation remains challenged 

our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment the equity markets hit a low in march 2009 with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to 025 since december 2008 our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 11 for fiscal 2012 compared to 13 for fiscal 2011 and 15 for fiscal 2010 

highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our results for fiscal 2012 benefited from the inclusion of surepayroll inc “surepayroll” a provider of payroll processing for small businesses acquired on february 8 2011 and eplan services inc “eplan” a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace acquired on may 3 2011 these acquisitions in fiscal 2011 and an immaterial business acquisition in fiscal 2012 contributed approximately 2 in total revenue growth for fiscal 2012 

  

nongaap financial measure 

in addition to reporting operating income a united states “us” generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies 

business outlook 

our client base totaled approximately 567000 clients as of may 31 2012 compared to approximately 564000 clients as of may 31 2011 and approximately 536000 clients as of may 31 2010 our client base increased 05 for fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 52 for fiscal 2011 and a decline of 32 for fiscal 2010 our organic client base growth was essentially flat for fiscal 2012 and declined 09 for fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 payroll services client retention was approximately 80 of our beginning client base a return to historical levels this is a slight increase over fiscal 2011 through our focus on providing highquality service to our customers to maximize client retention we received the highest client satisfaction results in our history 

our ancillary services provide services to employers and employees beyond payroll but effectively leverage payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our human resource services ancillary service offerings 

 

  

 

  

  

 continued investment in our business is critical to our success we continued to expand our product portfolio through internal development and acquisitions to add value for our clients in the second half of fiscal 2011 we acquired surepayroll and eplan these acquisitions have created excellent opportunities in their markets and allow paychex to offer a full range of payroll and 401k outsourcing alternatives during fiscal 2012 we continued to integrate these acquired companies in december 2011 we purchased icon time systems inc a provider of time and attendance solutions for small and mediumsized businesses with whom we previously had a successful business relationship through one of our time and attendance offerings additionally

financial position and liquidity 

the supply of high credit quality securities has been limited with the continued volatility in the global financial markets thereby limiting our investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment our financial position as of may 31 2012 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 7900 million and no debt 

our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity yields on high quality financial instruments remain low negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments we invest predominately in municipal bonds — general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds which are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds during fiscal 2012 our primary shortterm investment vehicles were high quality variable rate demand notes “vrdns” and federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” insured deposit accounts 

a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a1p1 ratings on shortterm securities we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we believe that our investments as of may 31 2012 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment 

our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 7066 million for fiscal 2012 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases business acquisitions and dividend payments from our operating activities our positive cash flows in fiscal 2012 allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2012 dividends paid to stockholders were 84 of net income it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2012 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

  

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 and our financial position as of may 31 2012 refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

outlook 

our outlook for the fiscal year ending may 31 2013 “fiscal 2013” is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes our expected fiscal 2013 payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth offset by an expected lower rate of growth in checks per payroll and modest increases in revenue per check human resource services revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our historical organic experience prior acquisitions are expected to have minimal impact to projected revenue growth rates for fiscal 2013 

our fiscal 2013 guidance is as follows 

 

 operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to approximate 37 for fiscal 2013 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to approximate 36 

interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2013 are expected to continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to remain at 11 for fiscal 2013 as of may 31 2012 the longterm investment portfolio had an average yieldtomaturity of 22 and an average duration of 30 years in the next twelve months approximately 15 to 20 of this portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 11 investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations 

earnings per share for fiscal 2013 is expected to be adversely impacted by approximately 001 per share due to a planned increase in our sales force and an increase in employeerelated costs for the increase in the 401k employer match implemented during fiscal 2012 

purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2013 are expected to be in the range of 95 million to 100 million this includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our product development fiscal 2013 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of 80 million to 85 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2013 to be slightly less than 20 million 

  

results of operations 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 

 we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2012 we had no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments and had insignificant exposure to european investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

 

   

  

 

  

  

 payroll service revenue payroll service revenue increased 5 for fiscal 2012 and 2 for fiscal 2011 to 15 billion and 14 billion respectively organic growth in payroll service revenue was approximately 4 for fiscal 2012 and 2 for fiscal 2011 both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 revenue benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check checks per payroll increased 20 for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2011 increased 27 compared to fiscal 2010 revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases partially offset by discounting our organic client base growth was essentially flat for fiscal 2012 and declined 09 for fiscal 2011 as new business formation remains challenged client retention improved for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 

human resource services revenue human resource services revenue increased 13 for fiscal 2012 and 10 for fiscal 2011 to 6762 million and 5974 million respectively these growth rates were impacted by the acquisition of eplan in may 2011 and the sale of stromberg time and attendance operations “stromberg” an immaterial component of paychex in october 2009 organic growth in human resource services revenue excluding the impacts of these events was approximately 11 for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 reflecting growth in clients and price increases the following factors contributed to the growth for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 

  

  

 total service revenue total service revenue increased 7 for fiscal 2012 and 5 for fiscal 2011 attributable to the factors previously discussed organic service revenue growth was approximately 6 for fiscal 2012 and 4 for fiscal 2011 

interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients decreased 9 for fiscal 2012 and 13 for fiscal 2011 compared to the respective prior year periods these declines were the result of lower average interest rates earned partially offset by an increase in average investment balances 

average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 7 for fiscal 2012 and 6 for fiscal 2011 the increase for fiscal 2012 was the result of the inclusion of surepayroll client funds wage inflation increase in state unemployment insurance rates and the increase in checks per payroll the increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates and the increase in checks per payroll offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base 

refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for fiscal years 

 

 a significant portion of the increases in expenses for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were driven by the acquisitions during these periods organic growth in combined operating and sga expenses exclusive of acquisitions and the aforementioned 187 million expense charge in fiscal 2010 was approximately 3 for fiscal 2012 and 2 for fiscal 2011 increases in product innovation and the supporting technology contributed to the increases in total expenses expenses related to information technology increased at a faster pace than total expenses for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have moderated these increases 

  

compensationrelated costs for fiscal 2012 were impacted by increased headcount in areas supporting our development of technology and higher employeerelated costs for health care and 401k employer match in addition the increase in expenses for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by personnelrelated costs in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and 401k employer match during fiscal 2011 along with onetime costs related to the separation agreement entered into with jonathan j judge our former president and chief executive officer as of may 31 2012 and 2011 we had approximately 12400 employees compared with approximately 12200 employees as of may 31 2010 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 due to business acquisitions 

other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment equipment costs professional services and other costs incurred to support our business the increase in other expenses for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of our acquisitions in addition higher equipment costs within information technology and higher professional services supporting our technology development contributed to the increases in other expenses for fiscal 2012 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded an expense charge of 187 million to increase our rapid payroll litigation reserve refer to note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on legal matters 

operating income operating income increased 9 for fiscal 2012 and 8 for fiscal 2011 the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 

 

 refer to the previous discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “nongaap financial measure” section on page 15 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the increases in investment income were primarily the result of higher average invested balances average investment balances increased 4 for fiscal 2012 and 1 for fiscal 2011 the increases were the result of investment of cash generated from operations partially offset by the impact on balances of cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan during the second half of fiscal 2011 fiscal 2011 benefited from a slight increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments that was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longerterm investment portfolio compared to the prior year 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 363 for fiscal 2012 compared to 350 for fiscal 2011 and 346 for fiscal 2010 the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of changes in state apportionment and lower levels of taxexempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 

  

2011 was primarily attributable to lower taxexempt income on availableforsale securities during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

net income and earnings per share net income increased 6 to 5480 million for fiscal 2012 and 8 to 5153 million for fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share increased 6 to 151 per share for fiscal 2012 and 8 to 142 per share for fiscal 2011 these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

liquidity and capital resources 

the supply of high credit quality securities has been limited with the continued volatility in the global financial markets thereby limiting our investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment our financial position as of may 31 2012 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 7900 million and no debt we also believe that our investments as of may 31 2012 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2012 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations 

lines of credit as of may 31 2012 we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 

 

 our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2012 or as of may 31 2012 

jp morgan chase bank na and bank of america na are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit which are discussed below 

letters of credit as of may 31 2012 we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 468 million required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2012 and december 2012 and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2012 or as of may 31 2012 subsequent to may 31 2012 the letter of credit expiring in july 2012 was renewed and will expire in july 2013 

  

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2012 the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2012 

 

  

 

  

 the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately 368 million as of may 31 2012 refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above we are currently under a state income tax audit for the fiscal years ended may 31 2004 through 2009 on july 14 2010 we received a summary of proposed tax adjustments from the new york state department of taxation and finance which was in excess of the reserve recorded as of may 31 2012 the outcome of the audit and the timing of settlement if any are subject to significant uncertainty it is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact if any if resolution is ultimately unfavorable to us 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to 529 million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years arrangements with some associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 was 117 million 104 million and 99 million respectively 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2012 

operating cash flow activities 

 

 the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 resulted mainly from fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by higher net income adjusted for noncash items the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 resulted mainly from increases in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

investing cash flow activities 

 

 funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

the fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio as there was a large inflow of collections on may 31 2012 that was invested primarily in shortterm investments on that date see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations in addition we increased our investment in longerterm availableforsale securities within our corporate portfolio in fiscal 2012 

the fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was related to the mix of investment securities in fiscal 2011 we continued to increase our investment in vrdns and the amounts of purchases and sales for availableforsale securities increased however partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing of remittances within the funds held for clients’ portfolio as compared to collections surrounding the fiscal yearend see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations 

  

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

purchases of longlived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 we purchased approximately 26 million 57 million and 32 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

during fiscal 2012 we had an immaterial business acquisition during fiscal 2011 we paid 1264 million for the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan during fiscal 2010 we received 131 million from the sale of stromberg an immaterial component of the company the purchases of other assets were for customer lists 

financing cash flow activities 

 

 net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days 

the fluctuation in net change in client fund obligations for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is the result of timing of collections and remittances as may 31 2012 fell on a thursday a large collection day for direct pay funds these funds were then paid out on friday june 1 2012 in 2011 may 31 fell on a tuesday and there were fewer collections from clients on that day in addition overall client fund balances were 7 higher on average for fiscal 2012 than for fiscal 2011 

the fluctuation in net change in client fund obligations for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the federal holiday on may 31 2010 offset by an increase in average client collections primarily due to higher state unemployment insurance rates as may 31 2010 was a federal holiday client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on friday may 28 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until june 2010 this resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal 2010 may 31 2011 did not fall on a federal holiday so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal 2011 

dividends paid in october 2011 the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 3 to 032 per share from 031 per share a quarterly dividend of 031 per share was paid to stockholders of record during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the fiscal years 2011 and 2010 the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 84 87 and 94 for those respective fiscal years the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

  

exercise of stock options proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stockbased awards increased for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 compared to the respective prior years common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 02 million shares for fiscal 2012 and 04 million shares for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 the increase in proceeds for fiscal 2011 was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal 2012 or 2010 refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation incentive plans 

other 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

recently issued accounting pronouncements at this time we do not anticipate that recently issued accounting guidance that has not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic 

  

trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

goodwill and other intangible assets we have 5174 million and 5137 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2012 and may 31 2011 respectively resulting from acquisitions of businesses the increase in goodwill was due to an immaterial business acquisition during fiscal 2012 

goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit during fiscal 2012 we adopted guidance that allows us the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of the reporting unit has declined below carrying value this assessment considers various financial macroeconomic industry and reporting unit specific qualitative factors our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our reviews no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years 2012 2011 or 2010 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which 

  

the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stockbased awards 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions must be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position our total reserve for uncertain tax positions was 368 million as of may 31 2012 and 344 million as of may 31 2011 refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

during fiscal 2012 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 11 compared with 13 for fiscal 2011 and 15 for fiscal 2010 when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsalesecurities which as of may 31 2012 had an average duration of 30 years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates in the next twelve months approximately 15 to 20 of our availableforsale portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 11 

  

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2012 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

 

 vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the federal funds rate remained at a range of zero to 025 throughout fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points under normal financial market conditions the impact to earnings from a 25basispoint change in shortterm interest rates would be in the range of 35 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 43 billion for fiscal 2012 our anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years for fiscal 2013 we anticipate our average duration on our availableforsale securities will increase to over three years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 595 million as of may 31 2012 compared with an unrealized gain of 593 million as of may 31 2011 in determining fair value we utilize the interactive data pricing service during fiscal 2012 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 464 million to 725 million during fiscal 2011 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 414 million to 862 million the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately 580 million as of july 13 2012 

as of may 31 2012 and 2011 we had 31 billion and 27 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 22 and 26 as of may 31 2012 and may 31 2011 respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may 31 2012 and 2011 assuming a hypothetical decrease 

  

in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2012 would be approximately 160 million conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2012 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 1800 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized loss of 03 million was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2012 and 2011 held an aa rating or better we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is not morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

sales and marketing

markets and competition 

 

industry data indicates there are approximately ten million employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those employers approximately 99 have fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and target market we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in this market segment 

 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us as of may 31 2011 we serviced approximately 564000 clients we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for fiscal 2011 client retention was approximately 79 of our beginning client base up two percentage points from the fiscal year ended may 31 2010 “fiscal 2010” clients lost in fiscal 2011 decreased 9 compared to fiscal 

2010 largely due to fewer clients going out of business or having no employees no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

 

the composition of the us market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

 

software maintenance and development 

 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

 

in fiscal 2010 we completed implementation of an enhanced platform for our core processing capability which allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service over the next few years we will expand this platform to additional service offerings 

 

employees 

 

as of may 31 2011 we employed approximately 12400 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

seasonality 

 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr solutions worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections important factors known to us that could cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those contained in the “safe harbor” statement at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the 

development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

 

our business and reputation may be affected by our ability to keep clients’ information confidential our business involves the use of significant amounts of private and confidential client information including employees’ identification numbers bank accounts and retirement account information this information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients and certain information may be transmitted via the internet there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulation investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business starts may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings we historically have not borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not

overview 

 

we are a leading provider of payroll human resource and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to mediumsized businesses our payroll and human resource services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio they are provided through either our core payroll or major market services “mms” which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs and include 

 

  

in addition to the above our softwareasaservice option through our mms platform provides human resource management employee benefits management time and attendance systems online expense reporting and applicant tracking 

our human resource services primarily include 

 

  

we earn revenue mainly through recurring fees for services performed service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients checks or transactions per client per pay period and utilization of ancillary services we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees our business strategy is focused on achieving strong longterm financial performance by providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technology and operating infrastructure and expanding our service offerings 

 

our financial results for fiscal 2011 reflected yearoveryear growth we continued to see improvement in many of our key business indicators especially in checks per client checks per client increased 21 for fiscal 2011 compared to a decline of 26 for fiscal 2010 checks per client began to show yearoveryear growth in the three months ending may 31 2010 with 11 growth for that quarter and continued to improve throughout fiscal 2011 reflecting increases of 12 25 28 and 20 for each of the sequential quarters our revenue growth has been modest as new sales units were relatively flat compared to the prior year largely due to lack of growth in new business starts 

 

our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment the equity markets hit a low in march 2009 with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to 025 since december 2008 our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 13 for fiscal 2011 compared to 15 for fiscal 2010 and 21 for fiscal 2009 

 

we continue to manage our headcount and expenses while investing in our business particularly in areas related to selling and servicing our clients product development and the technology required to support these areas we believe these investments are critical to our success looking to the future we continue to focus on investing in our products people and service capabilities positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for longterm growth 

 

highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows 

 

 13 

 

  

during fiscal 2011 we completed the acquisition of two softwareasaservice companies opening up additional areas of the markets we serve surepayroll inc “surepayroll” a provider of payroll processing for small businesses was acquired on february 8 2011 for 1149 million net of cash acquired surepayroll serves small businesses with its easytouse online payroll product and mobile application this acquisition allows us entry into a new area of the online payroll market and provides our clients with a mobile selfservice alternative the acquisition of surepayroll was dilutive to fiscal 2011 by less than 001 per share eplan services inc “eplan” a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace was acquired on may 3 2011 for 152 million net of cash acquired both entities now operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of paychex our financial results include the results of these entities from their respective dates of acquisition neither acquisition is significant to our consolidated financial statements 

 

nongaap financial measure 

 

in addition to reporting operating income a united states “us” generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies operating income net of certain items increased 7 to 7383 million for fiscal 2011 compared to 6885 million for fiscal 2010 and 7297 million for fiscal 2009 

 

business outlook 

 

our client base was approximately 564000 clients as of may 31 2011 compared to approximately 536000 clients as of may 31 2010 and approximately 554000 clients as of may 31 2009 our client base increased 52 for fiscal 2011 compared to declines of 32 for fiscal 2010 and 31 for fiscal 2009 excluding the impact of 33000 surepayroll clients our client base would have declined 09 for fiscal 2011 this reduction reflects the impact of lack of growth in new business starts on our client base as our new sales units were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2010 on a positive note our sales to clients who previously utilized the services of local and regional competitors improved for fiscal 2011 

 

for fiscal 2011 payroll services client retention was approximately 79 of our beginning client base a two percentage point improvement over the prior year as clients lost decreased 9 for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in client losses was largely attributable to fewer clients going out of business or having no employees for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 in addition we lost fewer clients to local and regional competitors for fiscal 2011 through our focus on providing highquality service to our customers to maximize client retention we received the highest client satisfaction results in the past several years 

 

ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings 

 

 

 

 

  

continued investment in our business is critical to our success in fiscal 2011 we made investments in our sales force and product development our sales force increased 2 to 2380 sales representatives for fiscal 2011 and is expected to grow 1 to 2400 sales representatives for the fiscal year ending may 31 2012 “fiscal 2012” this growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other human resource services offerings 

 

we have continued to expand our enhanced payroll processing platform to include additional service offerings this new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients our enhanced platform has led to improved productivity within our operations contributing to the increase in our operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue to 363 for fiscal 2011 compared to 354 for the prior year 

 

over the next few years we will continue to invest in our product development as we believe it is critical to our success we have introduced new product offerings to add value for our clients in fiscal 2011 we introduced paychex hr essentials an aso offering that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employeerelated topics we also introduced paychex smarttime tm time clocks for small businesses this selfcontained system offers small businesses an economical easytouse time and attendance solution that automatically collects and calculates employee hours and integrates with paychex payroll 

 

we continued the expansion of our insurance services nationwide simplifying the process required to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers we now service over 100000 clients through our subsidiary paychex insurance agency inc we believe insurance services is an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth 

 

we strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties we provide free webinars white papers and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes in addition the paychex insurance agency inc website wwwpaychexinsurancecom  helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage 

 

financial position and liquidity 

 

the volatility in the global financial markets that began in september 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment as of may 31 2011 our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 6713 million and no debt 

 

our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal yields on high quality financial instruments remain low negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments we invest predominately in municipal bonds — general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds which are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds our primary shortterm investment vehicle has been us agency discount notes starting in november 2009 we began to invest in select a1p1rated variable rate demand notes “vrdns” and have gradually increased our investment in vrdns to 8283 million as of may 31 2011 during fiscal 2011 we earned an aftertax rate of approximately 023 for vrdns compared to approximately 006 for us agency discount notes 

 

we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we believe that our investments as of may 31 2011 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment all investments held as of may 31 2011 were traded in active markets 

 

our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 7153 million for fiscal 2011 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases business acquisitions and dividend payments from our operating activities our positive cash flows in fiscal 2011 allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2011 dividends paid to stockholders were 87 of net income it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2011 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

 

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 and our financial position as of may 31 2011 refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

 

outlook 

 

our outlook for fiscal 2012 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes consistent with our policy regarding guidance our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects anticipated results for surepayroll and eplan the anticipated service revenue impact is approximately 2 and the earnings dilution is expected to be approximately 001 per share mainly due to amortization of acquired intangible assets our fiscal 2012 guidance is as follows 

 

 

 

operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 35 to 36 for fiscal 2012 the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35 for fiscal 2012 

 

interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the continuing lowinterestrate environment the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be 12 for fiscal 2012 as of may 31 2011 the longterm investment portfolio had an average yieldtomaturity of 26 and an average duration of 24 years in the next twelve months slightly more than 20 of this portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 10 investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations though at a lower growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal 2011 for business acquisitions 

 

under normal financial market conditions the impact to our earnings from a 25basispoint increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates would be in the range of 35 million to 40 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

 

purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2012 are expected to be in the range of 90 million to 95 million this includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our product development fiscal 2012 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of 75 million to 80 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million intangible assets acquired from surepayroll and eplan are expected to increase amortization expense for fiscal 2012 partially offset by the impact of fully amortized intangibles 

results of operations 

 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 

 

 

we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2011 we had no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue increased 2 to 14 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to a 5 decline for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2011 revenue benefited from an increase in checks per client and revenue per check checks per client increased 21 for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 revenue per check was positively impacted by lower discounting within our overall client base and price increases our client base excluding the impact of surepayroll declined 09 during fiscal 2011 this was largely attributable to the adverse impact on the sales of new units from lack of growth in new business starts client retention improved for fiscal 2011 with client losses that were 9 lower than for fiscal 2010 largely a result of fewer clients going out of business or having no employees in addition fiscal 2011 new sales units and client losses related to local and regional competitors improved compared to the prior year 

 

the decrease in payroll service revenue for fiscal 2010 was as a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic conditions on our client base and check volume our client base decreased 32 during fiscal 2010 and checks per client decreased 26 for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

 

human resource services revenue human resource services revenue increased 10 for fiscal 2011 and 3 for fiscal 2010 to 5974 million and 5409 million respectively human resource services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was impacted by the revenue earned from stromberg time and attendance operations “stromberg” an immaterial component of paychex prior to its sale in october 2009 in addition retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 was impacted by billings in fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients’ retirement plans required by statute which are not expected to recur for approximately six years this favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 by 124 million and did not recur in fiscal 2010 excluding the impact of stromberg in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 and the impact of retirement plan restatement billings for fiscal 2010 human resource services revenue growth would have been as follows 

 

 

this growth was generated from the following 

 

 

 

 

  

human resource services revenue growth for fiscal 2011 reflects modest improvements in economic conditions the client growth noted above and price increases paychex hr solutions revenue for fiscal 2011 was positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees contributing to this growth in clients and client employees is our new product offering paychex hr essentials growth in certain products that are primarily beneficial to our mms clients contributed positively to human resource services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 also insurance services revenue continued to grow as a result of increases in both health and benefits services and workers’ compensation insurance services revenue health and benefits services revenue continued its accelerated growth since inception increasing 29 for fiscal 2011 and 49 for fiscal 2010 driven primarily by the number of applicants 

 

somewhat offsetting these positive factors fluctuations in our peo revenue had an adverse impact on human resource services revenue growth for fiscal 2011 peo net service revenue is more variable quarter to quarter than our other revenue streams due to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees as healthcare rates change 

 

for fiscal 2010 client growth as noted above positively impacted human resource services revenue however the rates of growth were adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base this particularly affected retirement services although client growth for retirement services rebounded somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as client losses improved compared to the prior year 

 

in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the 35 and 33 increases in the asset value of retirement services client employees’ funds were driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to paychex for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees’ funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers 

 

total service revenue total service revenue increased 5 for fiscal 2011 and declined 3 for fiscal 2010 attributable to the factors previously discussed 

 

interest on funds held for clients the decrease of 13 in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by an increase in average investment balances the decrease of 27 in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities 

 

average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 6 for fiscal 2011 and decreased 5 for fiscal 2010 the increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2011 calendar year and the increase in checks per client offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base the decline in average investment balances for fiscal 2010 was the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client 

base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the “economic stimulus package” in the second half of fiscal 2010 the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year the economic stimulus package went into effect in april 2009 and its impact on yearoveryear comparisons of average investment balances had abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 this factor along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates resulted in average investment balances for funds held for clients growing 3 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in fiscal 2009 

 

refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for fiscal years 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded an expense charge of 187 million to increase our litigation reserve refer to note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on legal matters 

 

excluding the aforementioned 187 million expense charge combined operating and sga expenses increased 3 for fiscal 2011 and decreased 2 for fiscal 2010 the increase for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by personnelrelated costs in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and 401k match as indicated below in addition we continued to invest in our product development and supporting technology improvements in productivity with related lower headcount in operations have moderated this increase fiscal 2011 compensationrelated expenses include onetime costs related to the separation agreement entered into during the three months ended august 31 2010 with jonathan j judge our former president and chief executive officer expenses of surepayroll and eplan which are included in our results since their respective acquisition dates further impacted the growth in operating and sga expenses 

 

the decline in combined operating and sga expenses for fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force customer service and product development and supporting technology in fiscal 2010 we saved approximately 300 million from a freeze on salary increases and providing no matching contributions to our 401k plan we reinstituted salary increases beginning march 1 2010 and reinstated a 401k match effective january 1 2011 

 

as of may 31 2011 we had approximately 12400 employees compared with approximately 12200 employees as of may 31 2010 and 12500 employees as of may 31 2009 

 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011 due to the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business the increase in other expenses for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the largely fourth quarter impact from our two acquisitions 

operating income operating income increased 8 for fiscal 2011 and declined 10 for fiscal 2010 the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 

 

 

 

refer to the previous discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “nongaap financial measure” section on page 14 

 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the increase of 29 in investment income for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of higher average invested balances and a slight increase in average interest rates earned the 1 increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of investment of cash generated from operations partially offset by cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan during the second half of fiscal 2011 the increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longerterm investment portfolio compared to the prior year the decrease of 34 in investment income for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations 

 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 350 for fiscal 2011 compared to 346 for fiscal 2010 and 343 for fiscal 2009 the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to lower taxexempt income on availableforsale securities during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

 

net income and earnings per share net income increased 8 to 5153 million for fiscal 2011 and decreased 11 to 4770 million for fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share increased 8 to 142 per share for fiscal 2011 and decreased 11 to 132 per share for fiscal 2010 these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed in particular the 187 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by 003 per share for fiscal 2010 combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal 2010 decreased 28 or 228 million reducing diluted earnings per share by 004 per share 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the volatility in the global financial markets that began in september 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment our financial position as of may 31 2011 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 6713 million and no debt we also believe that our investments as of may 31 2011 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2011 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

lines of credit as of may 31 2011 we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 

 

 

 

our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

 

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2011 or as of may 31 2011 

 

jp morgan chase bank na and bank of america na are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit which are discussed below 

 

letters of credit as of may 31 2011 we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 474 million required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2011 and december 2011 and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2011 or as of may 31 2011 subsequent to may 31 2011 the letter of credit expiring in july 2011 was renewed and will expire in july 2012 

 

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2011 the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2011 

 

 

 

 

  

the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately 344 million as of may 31 2011 refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above we are currently under a state income tax audit for the fiscal years ended may 31 2004 through 2009 on july 14 2010 we received a summary of proposed tax adjustments from the new york state department of taxation and finance which was in excess of the reserve recorded as of may 31 2011 the outcome 

of the audit and the timing of settlement if any are subject to significant uncertainty it is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact if any if resolution is ultimately unfavorable to us 

 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities amounting to 521 million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years some arrangements with various associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 was 104 million 99 million and 123 million respectively 

 

in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us we guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party 

 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability theft and embezzlement and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2011 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

 

 

the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 resulted mainly from an increase in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related primarily to lower net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in noncash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the 187 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

investing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments as a result of volatility in the financial markets in september 2008 we divested of any vrdn securities held and began to utilize us agency discount notes as our primary shortterm investment vehicle us agency discount notes are cash equivalents vrdns although priced and traded as shortterm securities are classified as availableforsale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities as a result of the divestiture the proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities exceeded the purchases of availableforsale securities in fiscal 2009 much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients’ portfolio in november 2009 we began to again invest in select a1p1rated vrdns although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year we utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these vrdns and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of availableforsale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of availableforsale securities also in fiscal 2010 more corporate funds have been invested in longerterm municipal bonds in fiscal 2011 we continued to increase our investment in vrdns and the amounts of purchases and sales for availableforsale securities increased however partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing within the funds held for clients’ portfolio of remittances versus collections see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations 

 

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

purchases of longlived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we purchased approximately 57 million 32 million and 45 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

 

during fiscal 2011 we paid 1264 million for the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan during fiscal 2010 we received 131 million from the sale of stromberg an immaterial component of the company the purchases of other assets were for customer lists 

financing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the outflow of funds for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the federal holiday on may 31 2010 offset by an increase in client fund obligations for higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for calendar year 2011 as a result of may 31 2010 being a federal holiday client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on friday may 28 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until june 2010 this resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal 2010 also for fiscal 2010 there was an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the 2010 calendar year may 31 2011 did not fall on a federal holiday so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal 2011 

 

dividends paid a quarterly dividend of 031 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 87 94 and 84 for those respective fiscal years the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

 

exercise of stock options proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stockbased awards increased for fiscal 2011 and decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to the respective prior years common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 04 million shares for each of fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 the increase for fiscal 2011 was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal 2010 refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation incentive plans

recently issued accounting pronouncements at this time we do not anticipate that recently issued accounting guidance that has not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on 

historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred were 39 billion for fiscal 2011 31 billion for fiscal 2010 and 26 billion for fiscal 2009 

 

revenue from stromberg time and attendance solutions was recognized during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 until the date of disposition when all of the following were present persuasive evidence that an arrangement existed typically a noncancelable sales order delivery was complete for the software and hardware the fee was fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility was reasonably assured maintenance contracts were generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts was recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

 

our maximum individual claims liability was 10 million under both the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 policies as of may 31 2011 and may 31 2010 we had recorded current liabilities of 73 million and 58 million respectively and longterm liabilities of 206 million and 201 million respectively for workers’ compensation claims 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets we have 5137 million and 4216 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2011 and may 31 2010 respectively resulting from acquisitions of 

businesses the increase in goodwill was due to the acquisition in fiscal 2011 of two softwareasaservice companies whose results are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 

 

goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our reviews no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal year 2011 2010 or 2009 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 

 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stockbased compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stockbased awards 

 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions must be morelikelythannot to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after 

examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the morelikelythannot standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the morelikelythannot standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the morelikelythannot standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position our reserve for uncertain tax positions was 344 million as of may 31 2011 and 275 million as of may 31 2010 refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk factors 

 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our operating and investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow an investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings with more than 95 of our portfolio rated aa or better we invest predominately in municipal bonds — general obligation bonds prerefunded bonds which are secured by a us government escrow and essential services revenue bonds we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years all investments held as of may 31 2011 were traded in active markets 

 

starting in november 2009 we began to invest in select a1p1rated vrdns and have gradually increased our investment in vrdns to 8283 million as of may 31 2011 up from 2263 million as of may 31 2010 during fiscal 2011 we earned an aftertax rate of approximately 023 for vrdns compared to approximately 006 for us agency discount notes which have been our primary shortterm investment vehicle we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities subprime mortgage securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

 

during fiscal 2011 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 13 compared with 15 for fiscal 2010 and 21 for fiscal 2009 when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsalesecurities which as of may 31 2011 had an average duration of 24 years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates in the next twelve months slightly more than 20 of our availableforsale portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 10 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2011 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

 

 

 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

 

the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

 

  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 40 billion for fiscal 2011 our anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities and availableforsale securities with an average duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 593 million as of may 31 2011 compared with an unrealized gain of 666 million as of may 31 2010 in determining fair value we utilize the interactive data pricing service during fiscal 2011 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 414 million to 862 million during fiscal 2010 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 551 million to 824 million the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately 575 million as of july 11 2011 

 

as of may 31 2011 and may 31 2010 we had 27 billion and 22 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 26 and 29 as of may 31 2011 and may 31 2010 respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may 31 2011 and may 31 2010 assuming a hypothetical decrease in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2011 would be approximately 115 million conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2011 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 517 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the unrealized loss of 01 million was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2011 and may 31 2010 held an aa rating or better we intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is morelikelythannot that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

in addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts we utilize relationships with existing clients certified public accountants “cpas” and banks for new client referrals more than 60 of our new core payroll clients excluding acquisitions come from these referral sources to further enhance our strong relationship with cpas we have partnered with the american institute of certified public accountants “aicpa” as the preferred payroll provider for its aicpa business solutions partner program since 2003

markets and competition 

 

industry data indicates there are approximately ten million employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those employers approximately 99 have fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and target market we remain focused on servicing small to mediumsized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in this market segment 

 

we serve a diverse base of small to mediumsized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us as of may 31 2010 we serviced approximately 536000 clients we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice for the fiscal year ended may 31 2010 “fiscal 2010” client retention was approximately 77 of our beginning of the fiscal year client base while this is relatively consistent with the prior year we have begun to see some signs of improvement as clients lost in fiscal 2010 decreased 6 compared to the fiscal year ended may 31 2009 “fiscal 2009” no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 

the composition of the us market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we believe our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

 

software maintenance and development 

 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

 

in fiscal 2010 we completed implementation of an enhanced platform for our core processing capability which allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service over the next few years we expect to expand this platform to additional service offerings 

 

employees 

 

as of may 31 2010 we employed approximately 12200 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

 

seasonality 

 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex hr solutions worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new 

clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections important factors known to us that could cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those contained in the “safe harbor” statement at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weakening economic conditions employment levels may decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business starts may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings we historically have not borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continually change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business the recently enacted hiring incentives to restore employment “hire” act provides temporary tax breaks to companies that hire the unemployed and will impact our payroll tax administration service clients the recently enacted health care reform legislation will have a direct impact on insurance services clients failure to educate and assist our client regarding these legislations could have an adverse impact on our reputation failure by 

us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster severe weather including events resulting from climate change unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather including floods and snowstorms and has been successful however these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these service providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these service providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

 

our business and reputation may be affected by our ability to keep clients’ information confidential our business involves the use of significant amounts of private and confidential client information including employees’ identification numbers bank accounts and retirement account information this information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients and certain information may be transmitted via the internet there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulation investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any applicable state or federal laws 

 

we may have an adverse outcome of legal matters which could harm our business we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business these include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty employmentrelated claims tax claims and other matters refer to item 3 of this form 10k for additional disclosure regarding legal proceedings legal matters are 

subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business these include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty employmentrelated claims tax claims and other matters 

 

in august 2001 the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rapid payroll inc “rapid payroll” informed 76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their payroll processing software in august of 2002 the communication was sent due to the licensee contract assumed by us during the acquisition of rapid payroll in 1996 being very unfavorable to us thereafter lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes of action 

 

on march 9 2010 the court of appeal of the state of california upheld a jury verdict issued on june 27 2007 in litigation brought by one of the licensees in that case the california superior court los angeles county jury awarded to the plaintiff 150 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional 110 million in punitive damages we satisfied the judgment including statutory interest without further appeal this was the final pending matter in the rapid payroll litigation 

 

during fiscal 2010 we increased our litigation reserve by 187 million for the rapid payroll litigation our management currently believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded

overview 

 

we are a leading provider of payroll human resource and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to mediumsized businesses our payroll and human resource services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio they are provided through either our core payroll or major market services “mms” which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs and include 

 

 12 

 

in addition to the above our softwareasaservice option through our mms platform provides human resource management employee benefits management time and attendance systems online expense reporting and applicant tracking 

 

our human resource services primarily include 

 

  

we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients checks or transactions per client per pay period and utilization of ancillary services we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees our business strategy is focused on achieving strong longterm financial performance by providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure and expanding our service offerings 

 

our financial results for fiscal 2010 were impacted by the cumulative adverse effects of the economic recession in the united states “us” and global financial crisis that began in 2008 unemployment rates in the us reached a high in october 2009 and have remained high the equity markets hit a low in march 2009 with interest rates available on high quality instruments remaining low since then the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to 025 since december 2008 our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 15 for fiscal 2010 compared to 21 for fiscal 2009 and 37 for fiscal 2008 

 

the weak economy affects our ability to acquire and retain clients reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in our client base and results in lower average invested balances in our funds held for clients portfolio our results while reflecting a decline compared to fiscal 2009 were in line with our expectations although the economy has remained weak throughout fiscal 2010 our key indicators have reflected modest improvement as the fiscal year progressed 

 

highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 are as follows 

 

 13 

 

  

nongaap financial measure 

 

in addition to reporting operating income a us generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies operating income net of certain items decreased 6 to 6885 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 7297 million for fiscal 2009 and 6965 million for fiscal 2008 

 

business outlook 

 

our client base was approximately 536000 clients as of may 31 2010 compared to approximately 554000 clients as of may 31 2009 and approximately 572000 clients as of may 31 2008 our client base declined 32 for fiscal 2010 compared to a decline of 31 for fiscal 2009 and growth of 20 for fiscal 2008 the reduction in our client base for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on our ability to acquire and retain clients the environment for new sales remained difficult and new sales units decreased 49 for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of low levels of new business formation and fewer companies moving to outsourcing 

 

for fiscal 2010 client retention was approximately 77 of our beginning of the fiscal year client base while this was relatively consistent with the prior year we have begun to see some signs of improvement as clients lost in fiscal 2010 decreased 6 compared to fiscal 2009 clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees decreased 11 for fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 17 for fiscal 2009 we focus on satisfying customers to maximize client retention and for fiscal 2010 we again received high client satisfaction results 

 

ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin although the growth rates for our ancillary services for fiscal 2010 were slower than we have seen 

historically due to the impacts of the weak economy we continue to see opportunities within these services the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings 

 

 

 

 

  

continued investment in our business is critical to our success in fiscal 2010 we made investments in our sales force and in our technological infrastructure our sales force increased 2 to 2340 sales representatives for fiscal 2010 and is expected to grow 2 to 2380 sales representatives for the fiscal year ending may 31 2011 “fiscal 2011” this growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other human resource services offerings 

 

we have invested over 60 million in an enhanced platform for our core payroll processing capability which was fully implemented in fiscal 2010 this new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients over the next few years we expect to expand our enhanced platform to additional service offerings 

 

we continued expansion of our insurance services nationwide simplifying the process for our clients to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers we see our insurance services as an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth 

 

we also strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties the new paychex insurance agency website wwwpaychexinsurancecom  helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage in addition we provide information for existing and prospective clients on the impacts of regulatory changes such as the hiring incentives to restore employment “hire” act and the recently passed federal health care reform bill 

 

our aso and peo are now being offered under paychex hr solutions we integrated the sales and service model to support and expand our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services nationwide this allowed us to eliminate redundancies and create more flexible options for potential clients peo services will continue to be sold by the registered and licensed paychex business solutions inc and its affiliates 

 

looking to the future we continue to focus on investing in our products people and service capabilities this will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long term growth 

 

financial position and liquidity 

 

the current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets which has curtailed available liquidity and limited investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment as of may 31 2010 our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 6569 million and no debt 

 

we continue to follow our conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal in the past twenty months this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments since september 2008 our primary shortterm investment vehicle has been us agency discount notes since then we have seen gradual improvement in liquidity in certain money market sectors and starting in november 2009 we began to invest in select a1p1rated variable rate demand notes “vrdns” during fiscal 2010 we earned an aftertax rate of approximately 021 for vrdns compared to approximately 007 for us agency discount notes we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings 

we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer as of may 31 2010 we had no exposure to british petroleum bp or any of its subsidiaries we believe that our investments as of may 31 2010 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment all investments held as of may 31 2010 are traded in active markets 

 

our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 6109 million for fiscal 2010 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases and dividend payments from our operating activities our positive cash flows in fiscal 2010 allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2010 dividends paid to stockholders were 94 of net income it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2010 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

 

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 and our financial position as of may 31 2010 refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

 

outlook 

 

our outlook for fiscal 2011 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes consistent with our policy regarding guidance our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates we project that payroll service revenue for fiscal 2011 will be flat compared to fiscal 2010 human resource services revenue is anticipated to increase in the range of 10 to 13 interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in the range of 12 to 17 while investment income net is expected to increase in the range of 24 to 27 

 

operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 34 to 35 for fiscal 2011 the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35 for fiscal 2011 net income is expected to improve slightly over fiscal 2010 however when the impact of the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is excluded from fiscal 2010 net income growth for fiscal 2011 is expected to be flat 

 

interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2011 are expected to be impacted by the lowinterestrate environment the average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be 13 for fiscal 2011 as of may 31 2010 the longterm investment portfolio had an average yieldtomaturity of 29 and an average duration of 25 years in the next twelve months slightly over 15 of this portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 10 investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations 

 

under normal financial market conditions the impact to our earnings from a 25basispoint increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 35 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 

 

purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2011 are expected to be in the range of 80 million to 85 million as we continue to invest in our technological infrastructure fiscal 2011 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of 65 million to 70 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2011 to be approximately 20 million 

results of operations 

 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 

 

 

we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2010 we had no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue decreased 5 to 14 billion for fiscal 2010 as a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic conditions on our client base and check volume our client base decreased 32 during fiscal 2010 and checks per client decreased 26 for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 checks per client has shown modest improvement in each sequential quarter of fiscal 2010 reflecting yearoveryear declines of 50 37 and 22 for the first through third fiscal quarters and an increase of 11 for the three months ended may 31 2010 the “fourth quarter” at the end of fiscal 2010 checks per client were slightly higher than at the end of fiscal 2009 payroll service revenue increased 1 to 15 billion for fiscal 2009 due to our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services offset by impacts of weak economic conditions during fiscal 2009 our client base declined 31 affected by a decline in new client sales from new business starts and clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees checks per client declined 29 for fiscal 2009 

 

our payroll tax administration services were utilized by 94 of all our clients as of may 31 2010 compared with 93 as of may 31 2009 and may 31 2008 our employee payment services were utilized by 77 of our clients as of may 31 2010 compared with 75 as of may 31 2009 and 73 as of may 31 2008 nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80 of new clients select a form of our employee payment services 

 

human resource services revenue human resource services revenue increased 3 for fiscal 2010 and 11 for fiscal 2009 to 5409 million and 5236 million respectively the following factors contributed to human resource services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition growth in products that are primarily beneficial to our mms clients contributed positively to human resource services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 health and benefits service revenue increased 49 to 310 million for fiscal 2010 and increased 70 to 209 million for fiscal 2009 

while the above factors contributed to the revenue growth in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 as compared to the respective prior year periods the rates of growth have been adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base growth this particularly affected retirement services although we have seen client growth for retirement services rebound somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as client losses have improved compared to the prior year 

 

retirement services revenue growth was impacted in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 by billings in fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients’ retirement plans required by statute which are not expected to recur for approximately six years this favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 by 124 million and did not recur in fiscal 2010 

 

in fiscal 2010 human resource services revenue was also impacted by the sale of stromberg time and attendance “stromberg” an immaterial component of paychex our human resource services revenue growth excluding stromberg revenue and the retirement plan restatement billings would have been as follows 

 

 

 

in fiscal 2010 the 33 increase in the asset value of retirement services client employees’ funds was driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to paychex for fiscal 2009 the volatility in the financial markets caused the asset value of retirement services client employees’ funds to decline 12 the sp 500 declined 34 during the same period for both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees’ funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers 

 

for fiscal 2009 the decline in asset value and the shift in client employees’ retirement portfolios to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced retirement services revenue growth by 89 million also for fiscal 2009 paychex hr solutions revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per client decreasing revenue by 87 million 

 

total service revenue total service revenue declined 3 for fiscal 2010 and increased 4 for fiscal 2009 the cumulative effect of the weak economy had a negative impact on service revenue growth as previously described 

 

interest on funds held for clients the decrease of 27 in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities the decrease of 43 in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned lower average investment balances and lower net realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities 

 

average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased 5 for fiscal 2010 and 3 for fiscal 2009 these declines were the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 the “economic stimulus package” in the second half of fiscal 2010 the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year the economic stimulus package went into effect in april 2009 and its impact on yearoveryear comparisons of average invested balances has abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 this factor along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates resulted in average invested balances for funds held for clients growing 3 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in fiscal 2009

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for fiscal years 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded an expense charge of 187 million to increase our litigation reserve refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on legal matters 

 

excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve combined operating and sga expenses decreased 2 for fiscal 2010 and increased 3 for fiscal 2009 the decline for fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force customer service and technological infrastructure in fiscal 2010 we had a freeze on salary increases and made no matching contributions to our 401k plan we reinstituted salary increases beginning march 1 2010 but the freeze saved us approximately 150 million for fiscal 2010 as of may 31 2010 no decision had been made on the reinstatement of the 401k match although we saved approximately 150 million for fiscal 2010 from its suspension the increase for fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increases in personnel though at a slower pace than prior years and other costs related to selling and retaining clients and promoting new services as of may 31 2010 we had approximately 12200 employees compared with approximately 12500 employees as of may 31 2009 and 12200 employees as of may 31 2008 

 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods the increase in amortization in fiscal 2009 was a result of intangibles from acquisitions and client list acquisitions other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business 

 

operating income operating income declined 10 and 3 for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

 

operating income net of certain items is as follows for fiscal years 

 

 

refer to the previous discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “nongaap financial measure” section on page 14 

 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the decrease of 34 in investment income for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations the decrease of 74 in investment income for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances attributed to funding the stock repurchase program which was completed in december 2007 

 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 346 for fiscal 2010 compared with 343 for fiscal 2009 and 326 for fiscal 2008 the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes the increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of lower levels of taxexempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

 

net income and earnings per share net income decreased 11 for fiscal 2010 and 7 for fiscal 2009 to 4770 million and 5335 million respectively diluted earnings per share decreased 11 for fiscal 2010 and 5 for fiscal 2009 to 132 per share and 148 per share respectively these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed in particular the 187 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by 003 per share for fiscal 2010 combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal 2010 decreased 28 or 228 million reducing diluted earnings per share by 004 per share for fiscal 2009 combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income decreased 48 or 760 million reducing diluted earnings per share by 014 per share for fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share decreased at a lower rate than net income due to a lower number of weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program completed in december 2007 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the volatility in the global financial markets that began in september 2008 curtailed available liquidity and limited investment choices despite this macroeconomic environment our financial position as of may 31 2010 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 6569 million and no debt we also believe that our investments as of may 31 2010 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2010 along with projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

 

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

lines of credit as of may 31 2010 we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 

 

 

 

our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that 

collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

 

the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2010 or as of may 31 2010 

 

jp morgan chase bank na and bank of america na are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit which arrangements are discussed below 

 

letters of credit as of may 31 2010 we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 503 million required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies the letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2010 and may 2011 and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2010 or as of may 31 2010 subsequent to may 31 2010 the letter of credit expiring in july 2010 was renewed and will expire in july 2011 

 

other commitments we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under gaap are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2010 the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of may 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately 275 million as of may 31 2010 refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on income taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above we are currently under a state income tax audit for the years ended may 31 2004 through 2007 the examination phase of the audit is ongoing and we have received a summary of proposed audit adjustments it is not possible for us to reasonably estimate the impact if any if resolution of these proposed adjustments is ultimately unfavorable to us 

 

certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other longterm liabilities amounting to 469 million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 

 

advantage payroll services inc “advantage” has license agreements with independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services under these arrangements advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients when we acquired advantage there were fifteen associates over the past few years some arrangements with various associates have been discontinued and there are currently fewer than ten associates since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 was 99 million 123 million and 153 million respectively 

we guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 

 

we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets historically the amounts accrued have not been material we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2010 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

 

 

the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related primarily to lower net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in noncash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the 187 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 was attributable to lower net income the increase in noncash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and intangible assets the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

 

investing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the 

portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments as a result of volatility in the financial markets in september 2008 we divested of any vrdn securities held and began to utilize us agency discount notes as our primary shortterm investment vehicle us agency discount notes are cash equivalents vrdns although priced and traded as shortterm securities are classified as availableforsale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities as a result of the divestiture the proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities exceeded the purchases of availableforsale securities in fiscal 2009 much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients portfolio in november 2009 we began to again invest in select a1p1rated vrdns although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year we utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these vrdns and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of availableforsale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of availableforsale securities also in fiscal 2010 more corporate funds have been invested in longerterm municipal bonds there is a significant decline in net cash received from changes in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 related to proceeds from sales of availableforsale securities in fiscal 2008 that were not reinvested as part of the funding of the 10 billion stock repurchase program completed in december 2007 

 

in general fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

purchases of longlived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 32 million 45 million and 44 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” 

 

during fiscal 2010 we received 131 million from the sale of stromberg an immaterial component of the company during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 we paid 64 million and 329 million respectively related to acquisitions of businesses the acquisitions in fiscal 2008 related mainly to employee benefits products the purchases of other assets were for customer lists 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days as a 

result of may 31 2010 being a federal holiday client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on friday may 28 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until june 2010 also in fiscal 2010 we have seen an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the 2010 calendar year 

 

repurchases of common stock we repurchased 237 million shares of common stock for a total of 10 billion under our stock repurchase program completed in december 2007 

 

dividends paid a quarterly dividend of 031 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 in july 2008 our board approved a 3 increase in our quarterly dividend payment to 031 per share from 030 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 94 84 and 77 for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

 

exercise of stock options proceeds from and excess tax benefit related to exercise of stock options decreased for fiscal 2010 and for fiscal 2009 as compared to the respective prior years common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 04 million shares for each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 and 20 million shares for fiscal 2008 refer to note b to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stockbased compensation incentive plans

critical accounting policies 

 

note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred were 31 billion for fiscal 2010 and 26 billion for both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

 

revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists typically a noncancelable sales order delivery is complete for the 

software and hardware the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility is reasonably assured maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

 

in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund we maintain an allowance for returns which is based on historical data the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 

 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

 

our maximum individual claims liability was 10 million under both the fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 policies as of may 31 2010 and may 31 2009 we had recorded current liabilities of 58 million and 79 million respectively and longterm liabilities of 201 million and 179 million respectively for workers’ compensation claims 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets we have 4216 million and 4333 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may 31 2010 and may 31 2009 respectively resulting from acquisitions of businesses the decrease in goodwill was due to the divestiture in fiscal 2010 of stromberg an immaterial component of the company 

 

goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our reviews no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

stockbased compensation costs all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured 

as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 

 

we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stockbased compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stockbased awards 

 

we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements we must conclude that tax positions must be “more likely than not” to be sustained assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities if a tax position drops below the “more likely than not” standard the benefit can no longer be recognized assumptions judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit a change in the assessment of the “more likely than not” standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position our reserve for uncertain tax positions was 275 million as of may 31 2010 and 257 million as of may 31 2009 refer to note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we follow a conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal we invest primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years all investments held as of may 31 2010 are traded in active markets 

 

since september 2008 our primary shortterm investment vehicle has been us agency discount notes in september 2008 we sold all of our holdings of vrdns and prime money market funds as a result of turmoil in the related markets no losses were recognized on those sales the proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested in us agency discount notes since then we have seen gradual improvement in liquidity in certain money market sectors and starting in november 2009 we began to invest in select a1p1rated vrdns during fiscal 2010 we earned an aftertax rate of approximately 021 for vrdns compared to approximately 007 for us agency discount notes we have no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities subprime mortgage securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

 

during fiscal 2010 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 15 compared with 21 for fiscal 2009 and 37 for fiscal 2008 with the turmoil in the financial markets our conservative investment strategy has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2010 had an average duration of 25 years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates in the next twelve months slightly over 15 of our availableforsale portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 10 

 

the amortized cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2010 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

 

 

 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

 

  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 38 billion for fiscal 2010 our anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities and availableforsale securities with an average duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years 

 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 666 million as of may 31 2010 compared with a net unrealized gain of 667 million as of may 31 2009 during fiscal 2010 the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from 551 million to 824 million during fiscal 2009 the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of 152 million to a net unrealized gain of 866 million the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately 719 million as of july 12 2010 

 

as of may 31 2010 and may 31 2009 we had 22 billion and 18 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 29 and 33 as of may 31 2010 and may 31 2009 respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may 31 2010 we held no vrdns as of may 31 2009 assuming a hypothetical decrease in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2010 would be approximately 120 million conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2010 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while 736 million of our availableforsale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the decline in the fair value to 04 million below amortized cost was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2010 and the majority of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may 31 2009 held an aa rating or better we intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to that time our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

competition 

 

the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we believe our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

 

software maintenance and development 

 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

 

employees 

 

as of may 31 2009 we employed approximately 12500 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

 

seasonality 

 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex premier and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from our projections important factors known to us that could cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those contained in the “safe harbor” statement at the beginning of part i of this form 10k 

 

we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weakening economic conditions employment levels may decrease and interest rates may become more volatile these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services in addition new business starts may be affected by an inability to obtain credit the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates in addition during periods of volatility in the credit markets certain types of investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings we historically have not borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs however should we require additional shortterm liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continue to change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a

overview 

 

we are a leading provider of payroll human resource and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to mediumsized businesses our payroll and human resource services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs 

 

our payroll services are provided through either our core payroll or major market services “mms” which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs and include 

 

  

in addition to the above our softwareasaservice solution through the mms platform provides human resource management employee benefits management a time and attendance solution online expense reporting and applicant tracking 

our human resource services primarily include 

 

  

we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients checks or transactions per client per pay period and utilization of ancillary services we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees our strategy is focused on achieving strong longterm financial performance while providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure and expanding our service offerings 

 

our financial results for fiscal 2009 were affected by weak economic conditions in the united states “us” the severe credit crisis in the financial markets and extremely low investment rates of return on our funds held for clients the weak economy affects our ability to sell and retain clients reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in our client base and results in lower average invested balances in our funds held for clients the impacts were reflected in many of our key indicators with the most significant deterioration occurring in the three months ending may 31 2009 the “fourth quarter” as follows 

 

  

despite the economic pressures we achieved service revenue growth of 4 over the prior fiscal year as a result of our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll and human resource services we effectively managed our expenses as operating income net of certain items increased 5 and improved as a percentage of service revenue to 364 for fiscal 2009 as compared to 360 for fiscal 2008 refer to the discussion below for further information on operating income net of certain items 

 

our financial results for fiscal 2009 included the following highlights 

 

 14 

 

  

in addition to reporting operating income a us generally accepted accounting principle “gaap” measure we present operating income net of certain items which is a nongaap measure we believe operating income net of certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies operating income net of certain items increased 5 to 7297 million for fiscal 2009 compared to 6965 million for fiscal 2008 and 6054 million for fiscal 2007 

 

although we have been operating in an unprecedented economic environment during fiscal 2009 we maintained stability in our employee base allowing us to continue to focus on providing excellent customer service and invest in our business some of these investments include the following 

 

client base and increased utilization of ancillary services our client base was approximately 554000 clients as of may 31 2009 this compares with approximately 572000 clients as of may 31 2008 and approximately 561000 clients as of may 31 2007 our client base declined 31 for fiscal 2009 compared to growth of 20 for fiscal 2008 and growth of 33 for fiscal 2007 the reduction in our client base for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on our ability to attract and retain clients new client sales from new business starts decreased 19 for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year also an increase of 17 in clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees impacted our client retention which was slightly below historical levels at approximately 77 of our beginning of the fiscal year client base 

 

despite the challenging selling environment resulting from the weak economy we added over 111000 new clients during fiscal 2009 new sales revenue for mms clients was strong for fiscal 2009 increasing just under 20 compared to fiscal 2008 the market for mms has not been as severely impacted by the decline in new business starts 

 

we believe growth opportunities continue to exist in our target market of small to mediumsized businesses accordingly we continue to increase the size of our sales force in key areas primarily mms and health and benefits services reductions are expected in certain areas of our human resource services sales force due to deceleration 

in client bases and aggressive sales force increases in prior periods the following table summarizes the expected composition of our sales force in fiscal 2010 with comparisons to fiscal 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

there are also opportunities for growth within our current client base as well as with new clients through increased penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings 

 

 

 

service and product initiatives during fiscal 2009 we made investments in the ongoing expansion of our portfolio of services and products these included strengthening our softwareasaservice solution for our mms clients through the following 

 

  

in addition other fiscal 2009 initiatives included the following 

 

 16 

 

business acquisitions we may supplement our growth from time to time through strategic acquisitions when opportunities arise in fiscal 2009 we made immaterial acquisitions to supplement our payroll client base 

 

focus on customer service integral to our strategy is satisfied customers to achieve maximum client retention for fiscal 2009 we received high client satisfaction results which was encouraging considering the economic pressures our clients are facing client retention was approximately 77 of our beginning of the fiscal year client base although customer satisfaction remained strong increases in clients going out of business or no longer having any employees and pricing pressures from our largest direct competitor and regional payroll providers kept our client retention rate slightly below historical levels 

 

financial position and liquidity the current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets with diminished liquidity and increased exposure to investment losses occurring in these markets despite this macroeconomic environment as of may 31 2009 our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of 5747 million and no debt our cash and total corporate investments have increased approximately 140 million since may 31 2008 

 

we also believe that our investments as of may 31 2009 were not otherthantemporarily impaired nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any otherthantemporary impairment we maintain a conservative investment strategy within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal in the current financial markets this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments our exposure has been minimized in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer all investments held as of may 31 2009 are traded in active markets 

 

as of may 31 2009 we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes “vrdns” or prime money market funds in september 2008 we sold all of our holdings in these types of investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets no losses were recognized on these sales the proceeds from the sale of these investments were reinvested in us agency discount notes which is our current primary shortterm investment vehicle we have no exposure to auction rate securities subprime mortgage securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 

 

our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 6888 million for fiscal 2009 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases and dividend payments from our operating activities it is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2009 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future during fiscal 2009 dividends paid to stockholders were 84 of net income 

 

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 and our financial position as of may 31 2009 refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

outlook 

 

our current outlook for fiscal 2010 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes consistent with our policy regarding guidance our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates comparisons to fiscal 2009 quarters are expected to improve as fiscal 2010 progresses projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are as follows 

 

 

 

operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 34 to 35 for fiscal 2010 the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35 for fiscal 2010 the higher tax rate for fiscal 2010 is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes 

 

interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected 5 decline in average invested balances with most of the effect in the first half of fiscal 2010 this decline is largely the result of the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees the federal funds rate dropped significantly in fiscal 2009 from 200 as of may 31 2008 to a range of zero to 025 as of may 31 2009 as of may 31 2009 the longterm investment portfolio had an average yieldtomaturity of 33 and an average duration of 25 years in the next twelve months slightly less than 20 of this portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 140 based upon current interest rate and economic conditions we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income to decreaseincrease by the following amounts in the respective quarters of fiscal 2010 

 

 

 

under normal financial market conditions the impact to our earnings from a 25basispoint increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates would be approximately 35 million after taxes for a twelvemonth period such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate we estimate the lowest level of combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income over the next fiscal year would be approximately 55 million 

 

purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2010 are expected to be in the range of 55 million to 60 million fiscal 2010 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of 65 million to 70 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million 

results of operations 

 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 

 

 

we invest in highly liquid investmentgrade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of may 31 2009 we had no exposure to highrisk or illiquid investments details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

payroll service revenue payroll service revenue increased 1 to 15 billion for fiscal 2009 due to our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services payroll service revenue increased 8 to 15 billion for fiscal 2008 due to client base growth higher check volume our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services the weakening economic conditions in fiscal 2009 negatively impacted payroll service revenue during fiscal 2009 our client base declined 31 affected by a decline in new client sales from new business starts and clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees also checks per client declined 29 

 

as of may 31 2009 2008 and 2007 93 of clients utilized our payroll tax administration services our employee payment services were utilized by 75 of our clients as of may 31 2009 compared with 73 as of may 31 2008 and 71 as of may 31 2007 nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80 of new clients select a form of our employee payment services 

 

human resource services revenue human resource services revenue increased 11 for fiscal 2009 and 19 for fiscal 2008 to 5236 million and 4718 million respectively the following factors contributed to human resource services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

while the above factors contributed to the revenue growth as compared to the same period last year the rate of growth has been adversely impacted by weak economic conditions the volatility in the financial markets has caused the asset value of retirement services client employees’ funds to decline 12 to 85 billion as of may 31 2009 as compared to the same period last year the sp 500 declined 34 during the same period the decline in asset value and a shift in client employees’ retirement portfolios to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced retirement services revenue growth by 89 million for fiscal 2009 comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per client decreasing revenue by 87 million for fiscal 2009 the estimated growth in human resource services revenue for fiscal 2009 would have been 15 exclusive of these two items we also continue to experience volatility in peo net service revenue due to fluctuations in workers’ compensation claims and adjustments to workers’ compensation rates in 

florida offsetting some of the above revenue declines was 124 million of retirement services billings for client plan restatements during fiscal 2009 that are required by law approximately every ten years 

 

total service revenue total service revenue growth was 4 for fiscal 2009 and 10 for fiscal 2008 the weak economy had a negative impact on service revenue growth for fiscal 2009 refer to the discussion of key indicators in the “overview” section of this item 7 

 

interest on funds held for clients the decrease in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned lower average investment balances and lower realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities interest on funds held for clients decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances and higher realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities overall economic factors which have negatively impacted our client base have resulted in a decrease of 3 in our average investment balances for fiscal 2009 average investment balances for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 which deteriorated 9 were also impacted by the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the fiscal year ended may 31 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2007 we recorded an expense charge of 380 million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters refer to note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on pending legal matters 

 

excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve combined operating and sga expenses increased 3 for fiscal 2009 and 8 for fiscal 2008 this was primarily the result of increases in personnel though at a slower pace than prior years and other costs related to selling and retaining clients and promoting new services the lower growth rates in compensationrelated expenses for fiscal 2009 are a result of lower bonus and commission expenses attributed to the more challenging selling environment given the weak economic conditions and the slower pace of new hires as of may 31 2009 we had approximately 12500 employees compared with approximately 12200 as of may 31 2008 and 11700 as of may 31 2007 

 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods the increases in amortization are a result of intangibles from acquisitions and client list acquisitions other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business 

operating income operating income declined 3 for fiscal 2009 as compared to growth of 18 for fiscal 2008 the fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

 

operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve refer to the previous discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “overview” section of this item 7 operating income net of certain items is as follows for the year ended may 31 

 

 

 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the decrease in investment income for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances the decrease in investment income for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to lower average investment balances the lower average investment balances in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were a result of funding the stock repurchase program which was completed in december 2007 

 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 343 for fiscal 2009 compared with 326 for fiscal 2008 and 307 for fiscal 2007 the increases in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were primarily the result of lower levels of taxexempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios the increase for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was impacted by a higher effective state income tax rate as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” refer to note j of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

 

net income and earnings per share net income declined 7 for fiscal 2009 decreasing to 5335 million as compared to a net income growth of 12 to 5761 million for fiscal 2008 these fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed in particular for fiscal 2009 combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income decreased 48 or 760 million net income growth for fiscal 2008 was impacted by the increase to the litigation reserve of 380 million recognized in fiscal 2007 

 

diluted earnings per share decreased 5 for fiscal 2009 to 148 per share as compared to a 16 increase for fiscal 2008 to 156 per share diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008 increased at a rate higher than net income growth and for fiscal 2009 decreased at a rate lower than the decrease in net income due to a lower number of weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program completed in december 2007 in fiscal 2009 the decline in combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income noted above impacted diluted earnings per share by 014 per share

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1 of our total assets as of may 31 2009 

 

reclassification within consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

client fund obligations represent our contractual obligation to remit funds to satisfy clients’ payroll and tax payment obligations to better reflect the nature of these activities in fiscal 2008 we reclassified the net change in client fund obligations in the consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities to financing activities for all periods presented this reclassification had no impact on the net change in cash and cash equivalents or cash flows from operating activities for any periods presented refer to note b to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for more information on this reclassification 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

 

 

the decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 is attributable to lower net income the increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 reflects higher net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in noncash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and intangible assets the decrease in noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to the expense charge of 380 million to increase the litigation reserve in fiscal 2007 offset by an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to lower interest receivable balances and the timing of collection and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

 

investing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients consist of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the 

portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of investments the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services during fiscal 2008 proceeds from sales and maturities of availableforsale securities were not reinvested as a result of the 10 billion stock repurchase program completed in december 2007 in fiscal 2009 with the volatility in the financial markets funds previously invested in certain availableforsale securities were reinvested in cash equivalents additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k

construction in progress totaled 40 million and 521 million as of may 31 2009 and 2008 respectively of these costs 34 million and 516 million represent software being developed for internal use as of may 31 2009 and 2008 respectively capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use at which time we begin amortization of the costs during the last three months of fiscal 2009 a significant portion of the internal use software costs previously in construction in progress were placed in service these internal use software costs are being amortized over fifteen years at a rate of approximately 40 million annually 

 

during fiscal 2009 we paid 64 million related to acquisitions of businesses compared with 329 million and 31 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the acquisitions in fiscal 2008 related mainly to employee benefits products the purchases of other assets were for customer lists 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

net change in client fund obligations the client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days

other 

 

new accounting pronouncements in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 revised 2007 “sfas no 141r” “business combinations” sfas no 141r provides guidance on how an entity will recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired including goodwill liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests if any acquired in a business combination sfas no 141r further requires that acquisitionrelated costs and costs associated with restructuring or exiting activities of an acquired entity will be expensed as incurred sfas no 141r will impact business combinations that may be completed on or after june 1 2009 we cannot anticipate whether the adoption of sfas no 141r will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position as the impact is solely dependent on whether we enter into any business combination and the terms of such transactions 

 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 141r and other us gaap this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and is applicable to our fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 we do not expect that the adoption of this fsp will have an effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

in april 2009 the fasb issued the following three staff positions intended to provide additional accounting guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of debt securities 

 

  

these fsps are effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 and are applicable to our fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 we do not expect the adoption of these fsps will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in may 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 165 “subsequent events” this statement establishes guidance related to accounting for and disclosure of events that happen after the date of the balance sheet but before the release of the financial statements sfas no 165 is effective for reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 and is applicable to our fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

in june 2009 the fasb issued the following standards 

 

  

both standards are effective for annual periods beginning after november 15 2009 and are applicable to our fiscal year beginning june 1 2010 we are currently evaluating both standards but do not expect their adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force the american institute of certified public accountants and the sec did not or are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

note a to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred were 26 billion for each of fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists typically a noncancelable sales order delivery is complete for the software and hardware the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility is reasonably assured maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

 

in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund we maintain an allowance for returns which is based on historical data the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 

 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

 

in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 workers’ compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred our maximum individual claims liability was 1 million under both the fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 policies 

 

we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of 

 

 

 

valuation of investments our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value in determining the fair value of our availableforsale securities we utilize the interactive data pricing service a market approach unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value of investments are included in comprehensive income net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis on our consolidated statements of income realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income net 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer we regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets we have 4333 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may 31 2009 resulting from acquisitions of businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill our business is 

largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our goodwill impairment review no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations as part of providing payroll payroll tax administration services and employee payment services we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client’s bank account for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 

 

contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business as of may 31 2009 we had approximately 204 million of reserves for pending litigation based on the application of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated we deem this amount adequate the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter in light of the litigation reserve recorded we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded for additional information regarding pending legal matters refer to note n in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

stockbased compensation costs in accordance with sfas no 123r all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility both over a period equal to the expected option life we estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior 

 

under sfas no 123r we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stockbased compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under 

this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stockbased awards we also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin 48

market risk factors 

 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our operating and investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities we maintain a conservative investment strategy within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal we attempt to mitigate the risks associated with our investing activities by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and by investing in short to intermediateterm instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years all investments held as of may 31 2009 are traded in active markets 

 

as of may 31 2009 we had no exposure to vrdns or prime money market funds in september 2008 we sold all of our holdings of these types of investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets no losses were recognized on those sales the proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested in us agency discount notes which are currently our primary shortterm investment option we have no exposure to auction rate securities subprime mortgage securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

 

during fiscal 2009 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 21 compared with 37 for fiscal 2008 and 40 for fiscal 2007 with the turmoil currently in the financial markets our conservative investment strategy translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments when interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and longterm interest rate changes during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2009 had an average duration of two and onehalf years would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates in the next twelve months slightly less than 20 of our availableforsale portfolio will mature and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 140 

the cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2009 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

 

  

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

subject to these factors a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 39 billion for fiscal 2009 our anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities and availableforsale securities with an average duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years 

 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 667 million as of may 31 2009 compared with a net unrealized gain of 248 million as of may 31 2008 during fiscal 2009 the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of 152 million to a net unrealized gain of 866 million during fiscal 2008 the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of 

243 million to a net unrealized gain of 487 million the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately 727 million as of july 10 2009 

 

as of may 31 2009 and may 31 2008 we had 18 billion and 34 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 33 and 34 as of may 31 2009 and may 31 2008 respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may 31 2008 we held no vrdns as of may 31 2009 assuming a hypothetical decrease in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2009 would be approximately 110 million conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary and an impairment loss recognized 

 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer 

 

we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns we believe that the investments we held as of may 31 2009 were not otherthantemporarily impaired while certain availableforsale securities had fair values that were below cost we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms and that the decline in the fair value was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk as of may 31 2009 and may 31 2008 the majority of the securities with an unrealized loss held an aa rating or better we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment

competition 

 

the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we believe our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services products also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

 

software maintenance and development 

 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

 

employees 

 

as of may 31 2008 we employed approximately 12200 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

intellectual property 

 

we own or license and use a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business where it is determined to be appropriate we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights including but not limited to confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks we believe that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to us 

 

seasonality 

 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex premier and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any of the state or federal laws

we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients checks or transactions per client per pay period and utilization of ancillary services we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees our strategy is focused on achieving strong longterm financial performance while providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure and expanding our service offerings 

 

fiscal 2008 was our eighteenth consecutive year of record total revenue net income and diluted earnings per share it was also a milestone year for us as total revenue exceeded 20 billion for the first time our financial results for fiscal 2008 included the following highlights 

 

  

in july 2007 our board of directors the “board” approved a 43 increase in our quarterly dividend payment to 030 per share from 021 per share in august 2007 we commenced our program to repurchase up to 10 billion of paychex inc common stock we completed this program in december 2007 repurchasing a total of 237 million shares for 10 billion 

 

our financial performance for fiscal 2008 was largely due to service revenue growth of 10 over the prior fiscal year this growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth higher check volume price increases and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services the weakening economy and declining interest rates negatively impacted our total revenues for fiscal 2008 however continued leveraging of our expenses allowed us to achieve solid profit results during this fiscal year

certain items is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period it is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year’s targets and measuring management’s performance in connection with certain performancebased compensation payments and awards operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period operating income net of certain items is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission “sec” as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and therefore should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the gaap measure the use of any nongaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined nongaap measure used by other companies operating income net of certain items increased 15 to 6965 million for fiscal 2008 compared to 6054 million for fiscal 2007 and 5488 million for fiscal 2006 

 

we continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy some of these investments include the following

outlook 

 

our current outlook for fiscal 2009 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes consistent with our policy regarding guidance our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates we estimate the earnings effect of a 25basispoint increase or decrease in the 

federal funds rate at the present time would be approximately 45 million after taxes for the next twelvemonth period projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows 

 

 

 

growth in operating income net of certain items is expected to approximate 13 for fiscal 2009 the effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34 throughout fiscal 2009 the tax rate is higher than for fiscal 2008 due to anticipated lower levels of taxexempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios

our stock repurchase program commenced in august 2007 and completed in december 2007 is expected to impact net income and diluted earnings per share growth for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 with diluted earnings per share growing at a higher rate than net income fiscal 2009 diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding are expected to be comparable to the diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding for the three months ended may 31 2008

results of operations 

 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 

 

 

revenue payroll service revenue increased 8 for fiscal 2008 and 9 for fiscal 2007 to 15 billion and 14 billion respectively the increases in payroll service revenue were primarily attributable to client base growth higher check volume price increases and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services in fiscal 2008 we had seen signs of a weakening economy indicated by a more difficult than normal third quarter selling season and increases in clients going out of business or no longer having any employees 

 

as of may 31 2008 93 of clients utilized our payroll tax administration services compared with 93 as of may 31 2007 and 92 as of may 31 2006 our employee payment services were utilized by 73 of our clients as of may 31 2008 compared with 71 as of may 31 2007 and 68 as of may 31 2006 nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80 of new clients select a form of our employee payment services 

 

human resource services revenue increased 19 for fiscal 2008 and 22 for fiscal 2007 to 4718 million and 3962 million respectively the following factors contributed to human resource services revenue growth for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 

 

 

 

in addition revenue from health and benefits services was 123 million for fiscal 2008 a 93 increase from fiscal 2007 and revenue from benetrac was 84 million for fiscal 2008 

 

the decrease in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances and higher realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities interest on funds held for clients increased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a 

result of higher average interest rates earned and higher average investment balances the higher average investment balances in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were driven by client base growth wage inflation check volume growth within our current client base and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services refer to the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing interest rates 

 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the fiscal year ended may 31

excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve combined operating and sga expenses increased 8 for fiscal 2008 and 12 for fiscal 2007 this was primarily the result of increases in personnel and other costs related to selling and retaining clients and promoting new services fiscal 2008 expense growth benefited from continued leveraging in response to weakening economic conditions fiscal 2007 was impacted by the recognition of 257 million of expense related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123r” “sharebased payment” fiscal 2007 growth rates were also impacted by comparison to higher than normal levels of sales expense for fiscal 2006 as our sales force exceeded its targets as of may 31 2008 we had approximately 12200 employees compared with approximately 11700 as of may 31 2007 and 10900 as of may 31 2006 

 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods amortization increased in fiscal 2008 as a result of intangibles from acquisitions during the fiscal year amortization increased in fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our clientservicing arrangement with new england business services inc “nebs ® ” and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business 

 

operating income operating income growth was 18 for fiscal 2008 and 8 for fiscal 2007 the increases in operating income for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

operating income net of certain items excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve refer to the discussion of operating income net of certain items in the “overview” section of this item 7 operating income net of certain items is as follows for the year ended may 31 

 

 

 

the growth in operating income net of certain items for fiscal 2007 was impacted by the adoption of sfas no 123r effective june 1 2006 requiring recognition of 257 million of stockbased compensation costs in fiscal 2007 no stockbased compensation costs were recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2006 

 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the decrease in investment income for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to lower average investment balances resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program the increase in investment income for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was mainly due to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations 

 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 326 for fiscal 2008 compared with 307 for fiscal 2007 and 311 for fiscal 2006 the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower levels of taxexempt income which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and a higher effective state income tax rate as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” the decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of higher levels of taxexempt income and a lower effective state income tax rate for fiscal 2008 and 2007 the effective tax rate was impacted by nondeductible compensation related to incentive stock option grants refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

 

net income and earnings per share net income growth was 12 for fiscal 2008 and 11 for fiscal 2007 increasing to 5761 million and 5154 million respectively these increases were attributable to the factors previously discussed including in fiscal 2007 the increase to the litigation reserve of 380 million fiscal 2007 growth was also impacted by the 257 million of stockbased compensation costs due to the june 1 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r diluted earnings per share increased 16 in fiscal 2008 to 156 per share and 11 in fiscal 2007 to 135 per share diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008 increased at a rate higher than net income growth due to a lower number of weightedaverage shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of may 31 2008 we had 4348 million in cash and total corporate investments cash and total corporate investments as of may 31 2008 along with projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations

the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 reflects higher net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the decrease in noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to the expense charge of 380 million to increase the litigation reserve in fiscal 2007 offset by an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes the increase in noncash adjustment for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to the charge to increase the litigation reserve and 257 million in stockbased compensation costs due to the adoption of sfas no 123r the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to lower interest receivable balances in fiscal 2008 and the timing of collection and payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities

exercise of stock options the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 and for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share common shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal 2008 were 20 million shares compared with 18 million shares for fiscal 2007 and 17 million shares for fiscal 2006 we have recognized an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 91 million for fiscal 2008 and 97 million for fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in accordance with sfas no 123r as adopted on june 1 2006 for fiscal 2006 we recognized tax benefits related to exercise of stock options of 116 million that are reflected in cash flows from operating activities refer to note c to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stock incentive plans

critical accounting policies 

 

note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred were 26 billion 26 billion and 24 billion for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists typically a noncancelable sales order delivery is complete for the software and hardware the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility is reasonably assured maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

 

in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund we maintain an allowance for returns which is based on historical data the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 

 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting holding and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including social and economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

 

in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 workers’ compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred our maximum individual claims liability was 1000000 under the fiscal 2008 policy and 750000 under the fiscal 2007 policy 

 

we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of 

 

 

 

valuation of investments our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis on our consolidated statements of income realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income net 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets we have 4333 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may 31 2008 resulting from acquisitions of businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit we perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter based on the results of our goodwill impairment review no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations as part of providing payroll payroll tax administration services and employee payment services we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client’s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits electronic money fund transfers from client bank 

accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 

 

contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business as of may 31 2008 we had approximately 230 million of reserves for pending litigation based on the application of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated we deem this amount adequate the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter in light of the litigation reserve recorded we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded for additional information regarding pending legal matters refer to note m in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

stockbased compensation costs effective june 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires that all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options be recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility both over a period equal to the expected option life we estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior 

 

under sfas no 123r we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catchup adjustment recorded in the period of change with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stockbased compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stockbased awards we also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax position as a result of the adoption of fin 48 on june 1 2007

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk factors 

 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our operating and investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially effect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longerterm availableforsale securities in seeking to minimize the risks andor costs associated with such activities we generally direct investments towards high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings we manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years 

 

as of may 31 2008 we had no exposure to any subprime mortgage securities auction rate securities assetbacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper collateralized debt obligations enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds or structured investment vehicles sivs we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

 

we exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and have never experienced a failed auction our vrdns are rated a1p1 and must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial institutions our current exposure to vrdn bond insurers is limited to fsa 

 

our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates during fiscal 2008 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 37 compared with 40 for fiscal 2007 and 32 for fiscal 2006 the federal funds rate decreased 325 basis points in fiscal 2008 and was 200 as of may 31 2008 this compares to an increase in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and 200 basis points in fiscal 2006 a lower federal funds rate impacts the average interest rate we earn on our portfolios while interest rates are falling the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and shortterm interest rate changes 

 

during a falling interest rate environment the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our shortterm investments and over time will decrease earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2008 had an average duration of 27 years excluding the impact of vrdns tied to shortterm interest rates would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 

 

the cost and fair value of availableforsale securities that had stated maturities as of may 31 2008 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

 

 

 

vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as longterm securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 

the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

subject to these factors a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 41 billion for fiscal 2008 our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 55 invested in shortterm securities and availableforsale securities with an average duration of 35 days and 45 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years 

 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of 248 million as of may 31 2008 compared with a net unrealized loss of 149 million as of may 31 2007 the change resulted from decreases in longterm market interest rates during fiscal 2008 the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of 243 million to a net unrealized gain of 487 million during fiscal 2007 the net unrealized loss ranged from 295 million to 11 million the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately 233 million as of july 11 2008 

 

as of may 31 2008 and may 31 2007 we had 34 billion and 50 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity was 34 and 37 as of may 31 2008 and may 31 2007 respectively the weightedaverage yieldtomaturity excludes availableforsale securities tied to shortterm interest rates such as auction securities and vrdns assuming a hypothetical decrease in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of availableforsale securities as of may 31 2008 would be approximately 120 million conversely a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in fair value were considered to be otherthantemporary 

 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with a1p1 ratings and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer

competition 

 

the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we believe our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

 

in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services products also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

 

competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of service and product offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

 

software maintenance and development 

 

the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace

seasonality 

 

there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex premier and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

our business and reputation may be affected by our ability to keep clients’ information confidential our business involves the use of significant amounts of private and confidential client information including employees’ identification numbers bank accounts and retirement account information this information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients and certain information may be transmitted via the internet there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons our clients could experience data loss financial loss harm to reputation or significant business interruption such events may expose us to unexpected liability litigation regulation investigation and penalties loss of clients’ business unfavorable impact to business reputation and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continue to change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we may be adversely impacted by any failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients we rely on a number of thirdparty service providers these providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 

 

in the event of a catastrophe our business continuity plan may fail which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster unauthorized security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients 

we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology to maintain our growth strategy we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems particularly our systems that meet our clients’ requirements we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology if our systems become outdated we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful if we do integrate and update our systems in a timely manner or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions from time to time we acquire other companies the effective integration of acquired companies may be difficult to achieve it is also possible that we may not realize any or all expected benefits from acquisitions or achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner in addition we may incur significant costs and management’s time and attention may be diverted from other parts of our business in connection with the integration of acquisitions failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we currently have no definitive agreements with respect to any material prospective acquisition 

 

we may have an adverse outcome of legal matters which could harm our business we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business these include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract employmentrelated claims tax claims and other matters as of may 31 2007 we have a reserve of 325 million for pending litigation see item 3 of this form 10k for additional disclosure in light of the litigation reserve recorded our management currently believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of our operations however legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 

 

we may experience a loss as the result of our clients having insufficient funds to cover payments we have made on their behalf to applicable tax or regulatory agencies and employees as part of the payroll processing service we are authorized by our clients to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and applicable tax or regulatory agencies it is possible that we would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them we have in the past and may in the future make payments on our clients’ behalf for which we are not reimbursed resulting in a loss to us 

 

our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 

 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to our coemployment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employeremployee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the “coemployment” relationship as a result there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees who may be deemed to be our agents even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees’ conduct we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations in addition we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the “employer” under any of the state or federal laws 

 

we may be exposed to additional risks related to foreign operations as a result of our business in germany as of may 31 2007 we serviced approximately 900 clients in germany as a result our business is subject to political and economic instability unrelated to our operations in the us additionally our business in germany exposes us to currency fluctuations and we must operate under legal and tax regulations that differ from those of the us we do not currently hedge our foreign currency transactions due to the relatively insignificant amounts our entry into foreign operations requires a significant investment and management’s attention there can be no 

assurance that our investment in germany will produce expected levels of revenue or that other factors noted previously will not harm our business

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of our business these include disputes or potential disputes related to breach of contract employmentrelated claims tax claims and other matters 

 

in august 2001 the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rapid payroll inc “rapid payroll” informed 76 licensees that it intended to stop supporting their payroll processing software in august of 2002 thereafter lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes of action as previously reported in the prior periodic reports these lawsuits sought compensatory damages punitive damages and injunctive relief against rapid payroll the company its former chief executive officer and its senior vice president of sales and marketing in accordance with our indemnification agreements with our senior executives the company has agreed to defend and if necessary indemnify them in connection with these pending matters 

 

at the present time the company has fully resolved its licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by rapid payroll a decision favorable to paychex inc was issued by the united states district court for the central district of california with respect to the company’s dispute with one of the remaining two licensees that licensee is currently appealing the case a verdict was issued on june 27 2007 in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee in that case the california superior court los angeles 

county jury awarded to the plaintiff 150 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional 110 million in punitive damages the company will seek to have the verdict reduced or reversed through posttrial motions and if necessary an appeal 

 

we have recorded a reserve for pending litigation matters the litigation reserve has been adjusted in fiscal 2007 to account for settlements increases in reserves and incurred litigation expenditures during fiscal 2007 we increased the litigation reserve by 380 million to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending litigation matters our reserve for all pending litigation totaled 325 million as of may 31 2007 and is included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

in light of the reserve for all pending litigation matters our management currently believes that resolution of outstanding legal matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded

overview 

 

we are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small to mediumsized businesses our payroll and human resource services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs 

 

our payroll services are provided through either our core payroll or major market services “mms” which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs and include 

 

 13 

 

our human resource services primarily include 

 

  

we mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients utilization of ancillary services and checks or transactions per client per pay period we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees our strategy is focused on achieving strong longterm financial performance while providing highquality timely accurate and affordable services growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure and expanding our service offerings 

 

fiscal 2007 was our seventeenth consecutive year of record total revenue net income and diluted earnings per share our financial results for fiscal 2007 included the following highlights 

 

  

during fiscal 2007 we recorded an expense charge of 380 million to increase our litigation reserve which reduced earnings per share by approximately 006 per share disputes involving rapid payroll inc “rapid payroll” a wholly owned subsidiary of paychex inc arose in august 2001 these disputes resulted in litigation as has been previously disclosed at the present time we have fully resolved our licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by rapid payroll a decision favorable to paychex inc was issued by the united states district court for the central district of california with respect to our dispute with one of the remaining two licensees that licensee is currently appealing the case a verdict was issued on june 27 2007 in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee in that case a california superior court los angeles county jury awarded to the plaintiff 150 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional 110 million in punitive damages refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on pending legal matters 

 

on june 1 2006 we adopted the new accounting standard for stockbased compensation and recognized 257 million of related expense for fiscal 2007 refer to the “stockbased compensation costs” section following this “overview” section for additional information on stockbased compensation plans 

 

in managing and evaluating the results of our daytoday operations we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure we also use this measure in evaluating management’s performance in generating those results operating income increased 8 to 7015 million for fiscal 2007 operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients stockbased compensation costs and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve increased 15 to 6311 million for fiscal 2007 refer to the reconciliation of operating income to operating income excluding certain items included in “operating income” under the “results of operations” section of this review 

our financial performance for fiscal 2007 was largely due to strong service revenue growth of 11 over the prior fiscal year this growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth higher check volume price increases and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services 

 

our financial performance was also positively impacted by the effects of increases in interest rates earned on funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 40 for fiscal 2007 and earned an average rate of return of 40 an increase from 32 for fiscal 2006 and 22 for fiscal 2005 the federal funds rate was raised 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 525 as of may 31 2007 the impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

 

we continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy some of these investments include the following 

 

growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services our client base increased to approximately 561000 clients as of may 31 2007 this compares with approximately 543000 clients as of may 31 2006 and approximately 522000 clients as of may 31 2005 client growth was approximately 34 for fiscal 2007 compared with approximately 40 for fiscal 2006 and approximately 35 for fiscal 2005 

 

we have continued to invest in our direct sales force as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small to mediumsized businesses the following table summarizes the approximate composition of our direct sales force 

 

 

 

we believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base as well as with new clients through increased penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin the following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings 

 

 

 

service and product initiatives during fiscal 2007 we made investments to broaden our portfolio of services and products and 

 

 15 

 

  

business acquisitions we may supplement our growth from time to time through strategic acquisitions when opportunities arise we currently have no definitive agreements with respect to any material prospective acquisition 

 

focus on customer service we have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention for fiscal 2007 customer survey results were at an alltime high and client retention was at a record level of slightly more than 80 of our beginning client base 

 

financial position as of may 31 2007 we maintained a strong financial position with cash and total corporate investments of 12 billion our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations increased 11 to 6312 million for fiscal 2007 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases and dividend payments from our operating activities it is anticipated that cash and current corporate investment balances of 5911 million as of may 31 2007 along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

 

for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 and our financial position as of may 31 2007 refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

 

stockbased compensation costs 

 

effective june 1 2006 the “adoption date” we adopted statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 “sfas no 123 r” “sharebased payment” this statement requires that all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options be recognized as compensation costs in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant these costs are recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of income over the requisite service period we adopted this standard using the modifiedprospective transition method and accordingly results for the prior periods have not been restated comparisons between the results of operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are impacted by this method of adoption refer to note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information regarding stockbased compensation arrangements 

 

prior to the adoption date we accounted for stockbased compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as permitted by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” accordingly no compensation costs were recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of the stock options granted was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 

the impacts to the results of operations from recognition of stockbased compensation costs under sfas no 123 r are as follows 

 

 

 

as of may 31 2007 the total unrecognized compensation cost for all unvested stockbased awards was 607 million and is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 27 years the impact on future periods may change based on the issuance of additional stockbased awards as allowed under the paychex inc 2002 stock incentive plan as amended and restated effective october 12 2005 

 

for grants of stock options we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model for grants of restricted stock which were first granted in july 2006 the fair value is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant stockbased compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent to the adoption date are recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period to better align the costs with the employee services provided compensation costs for stockbased awards granted prior to the adoption date will continue to be recognized on an accelerated amortization schedule related to the graded vesting terms of the grant 

 

as part of the adoption of sfas no 123 r we did an indepth review of all of our assumptions used in calculating the fair value under a blackscholes option pricing model for grants subsequent to the adoption date we calculated the estimated volatility factor based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility we incorporated implied volatility as it is generally more reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility prior to the adoption date we used historical volatility based on monthly stock prices the expected option life of our stock option grants is determined from historical exercise behavior 

 

upon adoption of sfas no 123 r we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest previously in our proforma disclosures under sfas no 123 we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 

 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to types or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions can have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stockbased compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

outlook 

 

our current outlook for the fiscal year ending may 31 2008 “fiscal 2008” is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes projected revenue and net income growth is as follows 

 

 

 

the effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 315 purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2008 are expected to be in the range of 80 million to 85 million fiscal 2008 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately 65 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2008 to be approximately 17 million we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at the beginning of fiscal 2008 would be in the range of 50 million to 55 million for fiscal 2008 

 

results of operations 

 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 

 

details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

revenue payroll service revenue increased 9 for fiscal 2007 and 10 for fiscal 2006 to 14 billion and 12 billion respectively the increases in payroll service revenue were primarily attributable to client base growth higher check volume price increases and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services 

 

as of may 31 2007 93 of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services compared with 92 as of may 31 2006 and 90 as of may 31 2005 we believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity our employee payment services were utilized by 71 of our clients as of may 31 2007 compared with 68 as of may 31 2006 and 65 as of may 31 2005 nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80 of new clients select a form of our employee payment services 

 

human resource services revenue increased 22 for fiscal 2007 and 29 for fiscal 2006 to 3962 million and 3249 million respectively revenue from time and attendance products included in human resource services increased 15 for fiscal 2007 and 144 for fiscal 2006 to 172 million and 150 million respectively additionally growth was generated from the following 

 

 19 

 

  

the increase in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was the result of higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances the higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were driven by client base growth wage inflation check volume growth within our current client base and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services see the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing rates 

 

combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the fiscal year ended may 31 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation costs from the adoption of sfas no 123 r included in compensationrelated expenses were 257 million for fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2007 we recorded an expense charge of 380 million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters refer to note l of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on pending legal matters 

 

the stockbased compensation costs and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve accounted for 7 of the 16 increase in total expenses for fiscal 2007 most of the remaining increase for fiscal 2007 and the increase for fiscal 2006 were accounted for by increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients promoting new services and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology in addition for fiscal 2006 total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense as of may 31 2007 we had approximately 11700 employees compared with approximately 10900 as of may 31 2006 and 10000 as of may 31 2005 

 

depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions which are amortized using either straightline or accelerated methods amortization increased in fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our clientservicing arrangement with new england business services inc “nebs ® ” and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business 

 

operating income operating income growth was 8 for fiscal 2007 and 22 for fiscal 2006 the increases in operating income for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were attributable to the factors previously discussed 

 

in managing and evaluating the results of our daytoday operations we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure we also use this measure in evaluating management’s performance in generating those results operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients stock 

based compensation costs and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is as follows for the year ended may 31 

 

 

 

investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the increase in investment income for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is mainly due to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations 

 

income taxes our effective income tax rate was 307 for fiscal 2007 compared with 311 for fiscal 2006 and 325 for fiscal 2005 the decreases in our effective income tax rate were primarily the result of higher levels of taxexempt income which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and a lower effective state income tax rate for fiscal 2007 the effective tax rate was impacted by nondeductible compensation related to incentive stock option grants see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

 

net income net income growth was 11 for fiscal 2007 and 26 for fiscal 2006 to 5154 million and 4649 million respectively these increases were attributable to the factors previously discussed including in fiscal 2007 the increase to the litigation reserve of 380 million and the 257 million of stockbased compensation costs due to the june 1 2006 accounting standard adoption 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of may 31 2007 we had 12 billion in cash and total corporate investments cash and current corporate investments of 5911 million and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

 

in july 2007 we declared our regular quarterly dividend of 030 per share an increase of 43 from 021 per share at the same time we announced our intention to repurchase up to 10 billion of paychex inc common stock 

 

commitments and contractual obligations 

 

we have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows 

 

 

 

our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be 

administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

 

 

the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 reflects higher net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in noncash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to stockbased compensation costs of 257 million and the expense charge of 380 million to increase the litigation reserve the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection and timing of payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

 

investing cash flow activities 

 

 

 

funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of corporate investments additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

purchases of longlived assets to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities construction in progress totaled 465 million and 363 million as of may 31 2007 and 2006 respectively of these costs 395 million and 294 million represent software being developed for internal use as of may 31 2007 and 2006 respectively capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use at which time we will begin amortization of the costs 

 

during fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we purchased approximately 28 million 46 million and 25 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation the chairman president and chief executive officer of emc corporation is a member of our board of directors the “board” other assets increased for fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our clientservicing arrangement with nebs and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients 

 

financing cash flow activities

exercise of stock options the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 was primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share common shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 were 18 million shares compared with 17 million shares for fiscal 2006 and 07 million shares for fiscal 2005 we have recognized an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 97 million for fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in accordance with sfas no 123 r as adopted on june 1 2006 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we recognized tax benefits related to exercise of stock options of 116 million and 45 million respectively that are reflected in cash flows from operating activities see note b to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stock incentive plans

new accounting pronouncements in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income tax by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we will adopt fin 48 as of june 1 2007 as required while we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this interpretation and its guidance on application we currently estimate the adoption of fin 48 will increase the reserve for unrecognized tax positions by approximately 80 million primarily related to state income tax matters this increase will be recorded as a decrease to opening retained earnings as of june 1 2007 the adoption of fin 48 is also expected to impact our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 increasing it by approximately 50 basis points 

in may 2007 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no fin 481 “definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48” this fsp amends fin 48 to provide guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to “ultimately” settled through examination negotiation or litigation we will apply the guidance in this fsp upon adoption of fin 48 in june 2007 

 

in april 2006 the fasb issued fsp fin 46r6 “determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 46r” this fsp provides additional guidance on the determination of and accounting for variable interests under fasb interpretation no 46r this fsp was effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2006 and we implemented its guidance beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 relative to our limited partner investments in lowincome housing projects the adoption of this fsp did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this statement clarifies the definition of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we have not yet determined the effect if any the adoption of this statement will have on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” this statement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year of change through comprehensive income the statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2006 we currently do not have any benefit plans subject to this new statement and therefore expect no impact on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in october 2006 the fasb issued fsps related to sfas no 123 r as follows 

 

  

both fsps are effective in the first reporting period beginning after the date the fsp is posted to the fasb website which for us was the three months ended february 28 2007 the adoption of these fsps did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment to fasb statement no 115” this statement allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes in fair value recognized in the results of operations the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we currently do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

note a to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

 

revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably 

assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

 

peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred were 26 billion 24 billion and 22 billion for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists typically a noncancelable sales order delivery is complete for the software and hardware the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility is reasonably assured maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

 

in certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund we maintain an allowance for returns which is based on historical data the allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 

 

interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted up to 30 days after receipt with some items extending to 90 days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

 

peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

 

estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including social and economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

 

we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

 

in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 workers’ compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred our maximum individual claims liability was 750000 under both the fiscal 2007 policy and the fiscal 2006 policy 

we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of 

 

 

 

valuation of investments our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at market value unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis on our consolidated statements of income realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income net 

 

we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with an a1 rating and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 

 

goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets such as customer lists certain license agreements trade names and noncompete agreements the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates judgments and assumptions for certain fixed assets including software and intangible assets we use the assistance of independent valuation consultants the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

 

we have 4077 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of may 31 2007 resulting from acquisitions during the fiscal years ended may 31 2003 2004 and 2007 sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit based on the results of our goodwill impairment review no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

 

we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations as part of providing payroll payroll tax administration services and employee payment services we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client’s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits electronic money fund transfers from client bank 

accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 

 

contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business as of may 31 2007 we had approximately 325 million of reserves for pending litigation based on the application of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated we deem this amount adequate the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter in light of the litigation reserve recorded we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded for additional information regarding pending legal matters refer to note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

 

stockbased compensation costs effective june 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 r which requires that all stockbased awards to employees including grants of stock options be recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a blackscholes option pricing model this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility both over a period equal to the expected option life we estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior 

 

under sfas no 123 r we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catchup adjustment recorded in the period of change with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 

 

the assumptions of volatility expected option life and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior stock price trends and changes to type or provisions of stockbased awards any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stockbased compensation costs recognized in our results of operations 

 

we have determined that the blackscholes option pricing model as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 

 

income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse with the adoption of sfas no 123 r in fiscal 2007 we record a deferred tax asset related to the stockbased compensation costs recognized for certain stockbased awards at the time of exercise of nonqualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paidin capital we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paidin capital to absorb any deficient tax benefit related to stockbased awards 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk factors 

 

changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our operating and investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially effect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longerterm availableforsale securities in seeking to minimize the risks andor costs associated with such activities we generally direct investments towards high credit quality fixedrate municipal and government securities and manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

 

our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates during fiscal 2007 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 40 compared with 32 for fiscal 2006 and 22 for fiscal 2005 shortterm rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2006 with the federal funds rate increasing 200 basis points to 500 as of may 31 2006 the federal funds rate increased 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 525 as of may 31 2007 while interest rates are rising the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and shortterm interest rate changes as discussed below 

 

during a rising interest rate environment the increases in interest rates increase earnings from our shortterm investments and over time will increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which as of may 31 2007 had an average duration of 25 years excluding the impact of auction rate securities and vrdns that are tied to shortterm interest rates would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 

 

the cost and market value of availableforsale securities that have stated maturities as of may 31 2007 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

 

 

 

vrdns and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years although these securities are issued as long term securities they are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature 

the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

 

 

 

calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

subject to these factors a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

 

our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 44 billion for fiscal 2007 our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60 invested in shortterm securities and availableforsale securities with an average duration of 35 days and 40 invested in availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years 

 

the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized loss position of 149 million as of may 31 2007 compared with a net unrealized loss position of 220 million as of may 31 2006 during fiscal 2007 the net unrealized loss position ranged from 295 million to 11 million during fiscal 2006 the net unrealized loss position ranged from 252 million to 61 million the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately 192 million as of july 13 2007 

 

as of may 31 2007 and may 31 2006 we had 50 billion and 39 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at market value excluding auction rate securities and vrdns classified as availableforsale securities which are tied to shortterm interest rates the weightedaverage yields to maturity were 37 and 30 as of may 31 2007 and may 31 2006 respectively assuming a hypothetical increase in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities as of may 31 2007 would be approximately 120 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value this hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity these fluctuations in market value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations unless any declines in market value were considered to be otherthantemporary 

 

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and shortterm securities with an a1 rating and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer

competition 

  the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented we believe our primary national competitor adp ® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue we compete with other national regional local and online service providers all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 

  in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers we compete with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors our human resource services products also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

  competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of product and service offering and price we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

software maintenance and development 

  the everchanging mandates of federal state and local tax or regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients we are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace 

employees 

  as of may 31 2006 we employed approximately 10900 people none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements

seasonality 

  there is no significant seasonality to our business however during our third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new paychex premier and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these 

7 factors our total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

  in august 2001 rapid payroll informed seventysix licensees that it intended to stop supporting the payroll processing software in august of 2002 thereafter lawsuits were commenced by licensees asserting various claims including breach of contract and related tort and fraud causes of action these lawsuits sought compensatory damages punitive damages and injunctive relief against rapid payroll us our former chief executive officer and our senior vice president of sales and marketing in accordance with our indemnification agreements with our senior executives we will defend and if necessary indemnify them in connection with these pending matters 

10   on july 5 2002 the federal district court entered a preliminary injunction requiring that rapid payroll and us continue to support and maintain the subject software pursuant to the license agreements 

  in 2005 judgment was entered in accuchex inc v rapid payroll inc et al following a bench trial before a judge of the los angeles county superior court the judgment provided that the limitation of liability clause in the parties’ license agreement is valid and enforceable the court awarded accuchex damages of 305 thousand plus a refund of approximately 350 thousand in license fees the court also ordered rapid payroll to support its software being used by accuchex until such time as rapid payroll dissolves which the court found rapid payroll was entitled to do without incurring any further liability to accuchex the court rejected all of the other causes of action asserted by the plaintiff the case is pending on appeal with the california court of appeal second district 

  on february 28 and march 1 2005 the united states district court central district of california entered judgment in thirteen of the cases pending before it those judgments provided that rapid payroll’s liability is limited by the license fees paid to it by the plaintiff licensees pursuant to express contractual provisions of the license agreements those judgments also extended the court’s preliminary injunction ordering that rapid payroll must support the licensed software through april 30 2006 and at that time refund to each of the licensee plaintiffs the license fees paid by that plaintiff the license fees received by rapid payroll under the agreements from these thirteen licensee plaintiffs total approximately 25 million the federal court also ordered the release of the source code pursuant to the escrow terms of the license agreements the federal court judgments rejected the fraud and other tort claims brought by those plaintiffs against all of the defendants plaintiffs have appealed the federal court rulings and we have crossappealed

   business acquisitions we will supplement our growth through strategic acquisition when opportunities arise in the fiscal year ended may 31 2003 we expanded our client base through the acquisitions of advantage payroll services inc “advantage” and interpay inc “interpay” in fiscal 2004 the acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of stromberg llc “stromberg” along with the acquisition of stromberg’s time in a box ® product allowed us to expand our product offering to include time and attendance solutions and thus offer valueadded products and services to payroll and nonpayroll clients we currently have no definitive agreements or current plans with respect to any material prospective acquisition 

  focus on customer service we have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention fiscal 2006 client retention is at record levels of slightly less than 80 of our beginning client base the most significant factor contributing to client losses is companies going out of business in fiscal 2006 we reduced the number of clients per payroll specialist due to our commitment to continuously improve client service 

  financial position at may 31 2006 we maintained a strong financial position with total cash and corporate investments of 5774 million we also had 3845 million in longterm corporate investments at may 31 2006 our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 5692 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 4666 million in fiscal 2005 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases and dividend payments from our operating activities it is anticipated that current cash and corporate investment balances along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

  for further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 and our financial position at may 31 2006 refer to the tables and analysis in the “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections of this item 7 and the discussion in the “critical accounting policies” section of this item 7 

outlook 

  our current outlook for the full fiscal year ended may 31 2007 “fiscal 2007” is based upon current economic conditions and interest rate levels as of may 31 2006 and is summarized as follows 

 15 

   purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2007 are expected to be in the range of 85 million to 90 million in line with our growth rates fiscal 2007 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately 55 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2007 to be approximately 14 million 

  our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at the beginning of fiscal 2007 would be in the range of 45 million to 50 million for fiscal 2007 the total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments is expected to average approximately 45 billion in fiscal 2007 given current accounting interpretations in order to preserve the accounting treatment on availableforsale securities of recording market value fluctuations through comprehensive income instead of through the income statement we do not expect to realize any losses in the investment portfolios in fiscal 2007 

results of operations 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 16   details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

   

   revenue the increases in payroll service revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 and in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 were primarily attributable to growth in clients check volume and utilization of our ancillary services 

  as of may 31 2006 92 of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services compared with 90 at may 31 2005 and 89 at may 31 2004 we believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity our employee payment services were utilized by 68 of our clients at may 31 2006 compared with 65 at may 31 2005 and 63 at may 31 2004 more than 95 of new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 75 of new clients purchase our employee payment services 

  mms revenue increased 27 for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 to 2250 million and 1769 million respectively approximately onethird of our new mms clients are conversions from our core payroll service we had over 33000 mms clients at may 31 2006 

  human resource services revenue increased 29 in fiscal 2006 and 26 in fiscal 2005 as a result of higher revenue from the following services 

 17 

   the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2006 and higher average portfolio balances the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 and higher average portfolio balances offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of availableforsale securities the higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were driven by client base growth wage inflation check volume growth within our current client base and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services see the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k for more information on changing rates 

18   combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the fiscal year ended may 31 

   combined operating and sga expenses increased 12 in fiscal 2006 and 10 in fiscal 2005 excluding the expense charge to increase the legal reserve in fiscal 2004 the increases in both fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2005 were the result of our continued investment in information technology to create more efficient processes and systems as well as investment in personnel and other costs to support organic growth during fiscal 2006 total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense continued investments in new products and services geographic expansion within germany and other expenditures to continually improve client service fiscal 2005 growth was impacted by additional expenses as a result of our april 2004 acquisition of stromberg at may 31 2006 we had approximately 10900 employees compared with approximately 10000 at may 31 2005 and 9400 at may 31 2004 

  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to the purchase in may 2005 of a 127000square foot building in rochester new york and higher levels of capital expenditures amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions which are amortized using accelerated methods other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business 

  operating income operating income yearoveryear growth was 22 for fiscal 2006 and 23 for fiscal 2005 the increases in operating income in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are attributable to the factors previously discussed 

  investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenue the increase in investment income in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is mainly due to higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2006 and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations the decrease in investment income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is mainly due to lower net realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities and lower average interest rates earned on longerterm investments offset by an increase in average daily balances 

  income taxes our effective income tax rate was 311 in fiscal 2006 compared with 325 in fiscal 2005 and 326 in fiscal 2004 the decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of higher levels of taxexempt income which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and a lower effective state income tax rate see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

19   net income net income growth was 26 for fiscal 2006 and 22 for fiscal 2005 the increases in net income for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are attributable to the factors previously discussed 

liquidity and capital resources 

  at may 31 2006 our principal source of liquidity was 5774 million of cash and corporate investments we also had 3845 million in longterm corporate investments at may 31 2006 current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations capital purchases and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 

commitments and contractual obligations 

  we have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted secured shortterm lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows 

   our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex inc and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 

  the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet shortterm funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business if necessary no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2006 or at may 31 2006 

  we had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling 534 million at may 31 2006 required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies these letters of credit expire at various dates between july 2006 and december 2008 and are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolios including a 442 million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account effective june 28 2006 this 442 million letter of credit was increased to 509 million bringing the total letters of credit outstanding to 602 million no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2006 or at may 31 2006 

  we have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that under us generally accepted accounting principles are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at may 31 2006 the table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at may 31 2006 

 20  

   advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices “associates” which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions while paychex inc and advantage provide all centralized backoffice payroll processing and payroll tax administration services in addition advantage has a relationship with new england business services inc “nebs ® ” whereby advantage performs all client functions other than sales and marketing under these arrangements advantage pays the associates and nebs commissions based on processing activity for the related clients since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above commission expense for the associates and nebs in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was 190 million and 167 million respectively 

  we guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party in the normal course of business we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors which require us to defend and if necessary indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services to paychex and our subsidiaries historically there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications 

  we currently selfinsure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities historically the amounts accrued have not been material we have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability errors and omissions warranty liability and acts of terrorism and capacity for deductibles and selfinsured retentions through our captive insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  as part of our ongoing business we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes we do maintain investments as a limited partner in lowincome housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 

21 operating cash flow activities 

   the increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was driven by higher net income impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection and timing of payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities 

investing cash flow activities 

   funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k 

  the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases sales or maturities of corporate investments additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the “market risk factors” section contained in item 7a of this form 10k 

  acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired in fiscal 2004 we paid approximately 126 million in cash for the acquisition of stromberg and 06 million of additional purchase price related to the interpay acquisition 

  purchases of property and equipment to support our continued client and ancillary product growth purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities in fiscal 2006 we made purchases of property and equipment of 811 million compared with 707 million of purchases in fiscal 2005 and 506 million of purchases in fiscal 2004 in may 2005 we purchased a 127000square foot facility in rochester new york for 105 million construction in progress totaled 363 million and 295 million at may 31 2006 and 2005 respectively of these costs 294 million and 189 million represent software being developed for internal use at may 31 2006 and 2005 respectively capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use at which time we will begin amortization of the costs 

22   during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 we purchased approximately 46 million 25 million and 12 million respectively of data processing equipment and software from emc corporation whose chairman president and chief executive officer is a member of our board of directors 

financing cash flow activities 

   dividends paid in october 2005 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to 016 per share from 013 per share in october 2004 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to 013 per share from 012 per share the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 50 52 and 59 in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively future dividends are dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of our board of directors 

  proceeds from exercise of stock options the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in the number of stock options exercised common shares acquired through exercise of stock options in fiscal 2006 were 17 million shares compared with 07 million shares in fiscal 2005 and 13 million shares in fiscal 2004 we have recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 116 million 45 million and 102 million for fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively this tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paidin capital with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes see note g to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stock option plans 

other 

  new accounting pronouncements in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which replaces sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 “apb 25” “accounting for stock issued to employees” this statement requires that all stockbased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be recognized as compensation costs in the financial statements based on their fair values measured at the date of grant 

  prior to june 1 2006 we had accounted for grants of employee stock options under the intrinsic value method allowed under apb 25 and related interpretations and therefore had not recognized any compensation costs for stockbased awards as permitted by sfas no 123 we presented pro forma financial results including the effects of sharebased compensation costs in the footnotes to the financial statements refer to note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k under the heading “stockbased compensation costs” for the pro forma results for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 

23   sfas no 123r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 and permits adoption using one of the following two methods 

   we will adopt this standard beginning june 1 2006 using the modified prospective method accordingly the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations we anticipate the adoption of sfas no 123r will negatively impact net income in the range of 4 to 5 in fiscal 2007 increasing our operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

  unrecognized stockbased compensation costs related to existing awards as of may 31 2006 were approximately 383 million and are expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 24 years we cannot yet estimate what the compensation cost impact will be on our consolidated financial statements for the awards that we issue after june 1 2006 as it will depend on the terms of any future grants approved by the board of directors and the underlying assumptions used in calculating the fair value at the time of any such future grants the calculation of fair value is very sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions especially volatility and expected option term life 

  in addition sfas no 123r will impact how income taxes are recorded to our consolidated financial statements as tax deductions for certain taxqualified option grants “incentive stock options” are allowed only at the time a taxable disposition occurs this may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the early periods after adoption and it could cause variability in our effective tax rate throughout a fiscal year as these events occur 

  sfas no 123r also amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid in operating cash flows we cannot estimate what the amount of excess tax deductions will be in future periods however the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for excess tax deductions were 116 million 45 million and 102 million for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  our proforma disclosures under sfas no 123 utilized a blackscholes option pricing model for valuing employee stock options and allocated the expense using an accelerated method upon adoption of sfas no 123r we will continue to use a blackscholes option pricing model but will begin to allocate the expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period as we believe this better aligns the cost with the employee services provided 

  upon adoption of sfas no 123r we will be required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest in our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 we have accounted for forfeitures as they occurred our assumptions for forfeitures will be determined based on factors including type of award and historical experience and will be reevaluated regularly as an award vests 

  we currently offer an employee stock purchase plan to all employees under which stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with no discount to the market price and no lookback provision we have determined that this plan is noncompensatory and is not subject to the provisions of sfas no 123r therefore no compensation costs will be recognized related to this plan 

24   the following fasb staff positions “fsp” issued during our fiscal year ended may 31 2006 and related to sfas no 123r will be applied upon adoption of sfas no 123r for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2006 

   in october 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 131 “accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period” this fsp provides that rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations the guidance in this fsp was effective in the first reporting period beginning after december 15 2005 we have historically expensed rental costs incurred during a construction period and therefore the adoption of this fsp did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” this fsp provides guidance on determining if an investment is considered to be impaired if the impairment is otherthantemporary and the measurement of an impairment loss it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and was effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 we account for investments in accordance with this guidance and therefore the adoption of this fsp did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  in february and march 2006 the fasb issued the following statements amending sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities — a replacement of fasb statement no 125” 

   the guidance in these statements is effective in the first fiscal year beginning after september 15 2006 we do not utilize derivative financial instruments and currently do not have any servicing assets or servicing liabilities that would fall under the guidance of either statement and therefore the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

critical accounting policies 

  note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations 

25 and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

  revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenue is largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

  peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred for peo worksite employees were 24145 million 22308 million and 18461 million for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists typically a noncancelable sales order delivery is complete for the software and hardware the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility is reasonably assured maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

  interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt with some items extending to ninety days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

  peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we utilize an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 

  estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including social and economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

  we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is identified such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

  in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 workers’ compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred our maximum individual claims liability was 750000 under the fiscal 2006 policy and 500000 under the fiscal 2005 policy 

26   we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of may 31 

   valuation of investments our investments in availableforsale securities are reported at market value unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income net of tax as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis on our consolidated statements of income realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income net 

  we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our availableforsale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities aaa and aarated securities and a1rated shortterm securities we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 

  goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets such as customer lists certain license agreements trade names and noncompete agreements the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates judgments and assumptions for certain fixed assets including software and intangible assets we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

  we have 4058 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at may 31 2006 resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit based on the results of our goodwill impairment review no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

  we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

  accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations as part of providing payroll payroll tax administration services and employee payment services we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client’s 

27 account for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 

  contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business at may 31 2006 we had approximately 156 million of reserves for pending legal matters based on the application of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated we deem this amount adequate the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter in light of the legal reserve recorded we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded for additional information regarding pending legal matters refer to note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

  income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we account for the tax benefit from the exercise of nonqualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paidin capital

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk factors 

  changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale securities as a result of our operating and investing activities we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longerterm availableforsale securities in seeking to minimize the risks andor costs associated with such activities we generally direct investments towards high credit quality fixedrate municipal and government securities and manage the availableforsale securities to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 

  our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates the federal funds rate has increased to 500 as of may 31 2006 during fiscal 2006 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 32 compared with 22 for fiscal 2005 and 18 for fiscal 2004 shortterm rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2005 longerterm rates on average were basically unchanged from fiscal 2004 but have risen steadily in fiscal 2006 while shortterm and longterm interest rates generally move in the same direction there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship while interest rates are rising the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and shortterm interest rate changes as discussed below the federal funds rate decreased from 650 at may 31 2000 to 100 at may 31 2004 the decreasing interest rate environment experienced through fiscal 2004 negatively affected net income growth during fiscal 2004 the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longerterm availableforsale securities and we were able to mitigate some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from sales of our investments 

28   increases in interest rates increase earnings from our shortterm investments and over time will increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale securities earnings from the availableforsale securities which currently have an average duration of 20 years excluding the impact of auction rate securities and vrdns that are tied to shortterm interest rates will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates an increasing interest rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the market value of our investment portfolio 

  the cost and market value of availableforsale securities that have stated maturities at may 31 2006 are shown below by contractual maturity expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

   vrdns and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities is typically twenty to thirty years although these securities are issued as longterm securities both are priced and traded as shortterm instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature 

  the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

   the federal funds rate was increased to 525 on june 29 2006 

  calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to daily interest rate changes seasonal variations in investment balances actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale securities the proportional mix of taxable and taxexempt investments and changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous subject to these factors a 25basispoint change in taxable interest rates generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

  our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately 39 billion for the full year ended may 31 2006 our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60 invested in shortterm securities and availableforsale securities that are priced and traded as shortterm securities auction rate securities and vrdns with an average duration of thirtyfive days and 40 invested in other availableforsale securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years based on these current assumptions we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 

29 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at the beginning of fiscal 2007 would be approximately 45 million to 50 million for fiscal 2007 

  the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of 220 million at may 31 2006 compared with a net unrealized loss of 99 million at may 31 2005 and a net unrealized loss of 42 million at may 31 2004 during fiscal 2006 the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of 252 million to 61 million during fiscal 2005 the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately 144 million net unrealized loss to 106 million net unrealized gain the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately 239 million at july 20 2006 

  as of may 31 2006 and may 31 2005 we had 39 billion and 36 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at market value excluding auction rate securities and vrdns classified as availableforsale securities which are tied to shortterm interest rates the weighted average yields to maturity were 30 and 26 as of may 31 2006 and may 31 2005 respectively assuming a hypothetical increase in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities at may 31 2006 would be approximately 85 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value this hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations 

  credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds we attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaaand aarated securities and a1 rated shortterm securities and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer

competition 

  the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented the company believes its primary national competitor adp® “automatic data processing inc” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue paychex competes with other national regional local and online service providers all of which it believes have significantly smaller client bases than paychex 

6   in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers the company competes with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors the company’s human resource and benefits products and services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms 

  competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of product and service offering and price paychex believes it is competitive in each of these areas 

software maintenance and development 

  the everchanging mandates of federal state and local taxing authorities require paychex to regularly update the proprietary software it utilizes to provide payroll and human resource and benefits services to its clients the company is continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintenance of its various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of its clients and the marketplace

seasonality 

  there is no significant seasonality to the company’s business however during the company’s third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients new retirement services clients and new pas and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients begin using paychex services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors the company’s total revenue has been slightly higher in the third fiscal quarter with greater sales commission expenses also reported in this quarter

  the company may make errors and omissions in providing services which could result in significant penalties and liabilities for the company processing tracking collecting and remitting client funds to the various taxing authorities client employees and other third parties are complex operations these tasks could be subject to error and these errors could include but are not limited to late filing with tax agencies underpayment of taxes and failure to comply with applicable banking regulations and laws relating to employee benefits administration which could result in significant penalties and liabilities that would adversely affect the company’s results of operations the company could also transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong amount and may be unable to correct the error or recover the funds resulting in a loss to the company 

  changes in government regulations and policies could adversely impact the business many of the company’s services particularly tax filing and payment services and benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continue to change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of the company’s services and substantially decrease its revenue added requirements could also increase the company’s cost of doing business failure by the company to modify its services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have adverse effects on the company’s results of operations 

  failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions could harm the company’s business as part of providing services to clients paychex relies on a number of thirdparty service providers these providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks which electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to company operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to the company 

  failure of the company’s business continuity plan in the event of a catastrophe could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations the company’s operations are dependent on its ability to protect its infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or similar event the company has a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario the company could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to its operations or delivery of services to its clients 

  investments in new technology for the company’s internal use may not be implemented in a timely or costeffective manner which could impact the company’s results of operations to maintain its growth strategy the company must adapt and respond to technological advances offered by its competitors and technological requirements of its clients the company has made significant investments related to the development of new technologies for internal use such technologies may not be implemented in a timely manner or within targeted costs delays or difficulties in implementation or added costs could impact the company’s results of operations 

  acquisitions may not provide anticipated benefits the effective integration of acquired companies may be difficult to achieve it is also possible that the company may not realize any or all expected benefits from acquisitions or achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner in addition the company may incur significant costs and management’s time and attention may be diverted in connection with the integration of acquisitions failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could affect the company’s results of operations the company currently has no definitive agreements or current plans with respect to any material prospective acquisitions 

8   the adverse outcome of legal matters could harm the company’s business the company is subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business these include disputes related to breach of contract employmentrelated claims and other matters as of may 31 2005 the company has a reserve of 253 million for pending legal matters see item 3 of this form 10k for additional disclosure in light of the legal reserve recorded the company’s management currently believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded

10 the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded

overview 

  we are a leading national provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small to mediumsized businesses we have a broad portfolio of products and services that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs which include 

   our strategy is focused on growing our client base increasing utilization of our ancillary services and leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure we earn revenues primarily through recurring fees 

12 for services performed related to our products service revenues are largely driven by the number of clients utilization of ancillary services and checks or transactions per client per pay period we also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the respective tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 

  fiscal 2005 was our fifteenth consecutive year of record total revenues net income and diluted earnings per share our financial results for fiscal 2005 included the following highlights 

   our growth rates in fiscal 2005 were due to strong service revenue growth of 12 and the impact of expense charges recorded in fiscal 2004 related to pending legal matters these expense charges reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 by approximately 006 per share 

  during fiscal 2005 we began to see positive signs of economic improvement especially in the interest rate environment the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate by 200 basis points since june 2004 to 300 as of may 31 2005 our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 3 yearoveryear for fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2005 our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 22 compared with 18 in fiscal 2004 and 25 in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 we were able to offset some of the impact of lower interest rates by realizing gains on the sale of availableforsale securities of 191 million for fiscal 2004 and 178 million for fiscal 2003 this compares to net realized gains of 02 million in fiscal 2005 the impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the “market risk factors” section in item 7a of this form 10k 

  we continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy some of these investments include the following 

  growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services our client base increased to approximately 522000 clients at may 31 2005 this compares with approximately 505000 clients at may 31 2004 and approximately 490000 clients at may 31 2003 yearoveryear client growth was approximately 35 for fiscal 2005 compared with 31 for fiscal 2004 client growth excluding the impact of the advantage and interpay inc “interpay” acquisitions was approximately 6 for fiscal 2005 and 7 for fiscal 2004 

13   we have continued to invest in our direct sales force as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small to mediumsized businesses the approximate composition of our direct sales force is summarized in the following table 

   we believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base as well as with new clients through increased utilization of our payrollrelated and human resource ancillary services ancillary services effectively leverage the payroll processing data and therefore are beneficial to our operating margin penetration of our tax filing and payment services and our employee payment services has continued to increase and total 90 and 65 respectively at may 31 2005 our client bases in the human resource and employee benefits areas have continued to grow as shown in the following table 

   acquired businesses during fiscal 2003 we acquired two payroll service providers servicing small to mediumsized businesses in the united states advantage was purchased on september 20 2002 and interpay was purchased on april 1 2003 since the completion of the acquisitions we have integrated the sales force branch operations and corporate support of these acquired businesses to provide efficiencies in operations and services provided to our clients by november 2004 we had successfully converted all interpay clients to our paychex software platforms and fully completed the integration of interpay the advantage payroll system is being retained for the foreseeable future in order to service clients affiliated with independently owned associate offices and advantage cobranded products 

  in april 2004 we acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of stromberg llc “stromberg” this acquisition along with the october 2003 acquisition of stromberg’s time in a box® product has allowed us to expand our product offering to include time and attendance solutions and thus offer valueadded products and services to payroll and nonpayroll clients 

  focus on customer service we have always focused on customer service and maximizing client retention fiscal year client retention is at record levels of slightly less than 80 of our beginning client base the most significant factor contributing to our client losses is companies going out of business 

  at may 31 2005 we maintained a strong financial position with total cash and corporate investments of 7076 million our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations cash flow from operations was 4679 million in fiscal 2005 and 3899 million in fiscal 2004 historically we have funded our operations capital purchases and dividend payments from our operating activities the acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal 2003 and stromberg in fiscal 2004 were funded from our cash and corporate investments it is anticipated that current cash and corporate investment balances along with projected operating cash flows will support our normal business operations capital purchases and current dividend payments for the foreseeable future

outlook

  our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at the beginning of fiscal 2006 would be in the range of 37 million to 42 million for fiscal 2006 the total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments is expected to average approximately 38 billion in fiscal 2006 given current accounting interpretations in order to preserve the accounting treatment on availableforsale securities of recording market value fluctuations through comprehensive income instead of through the income statement we do not expect to realize any losses in the investment portfolios in fiscal 2006 

results of operations 

summary of results of operations for the fiscal years ended may 31 

 15   details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows 

   

   revenues our total service revenues are comprised of revenues from the payroll and human resource and benefits services payroll service revenues are earned primarily from payroll processing tax filing and payment services employee payment services and other ancillary services through either our core payroll or major market services human resource and benefits service revenues are earned primarily from retirement services workers’ compensation insurance administration section 125 plan administration paychex administrative services “pas” and professional employer organization “peo” services and time and attendance solutions 

  our total service revenues growth yearoveryear was 12 for fiscal 2005 and 19 for fiscal 2004 the yearoveryear growth in payroll service revenues in fiscal 2005 was due to increased utilization of our ancillary services growth from within our current client base and price increases the increase in payroll service revenues in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 was attributable to these same factors as well as the acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal 2003 

  as of may 31 2005 90 of all clients utilized our tax filing and payment services compared with 89 at may 31 2004 and 87 at may 31 2003 we believe our client utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is near maturity our employee payment services were utilized by 65 of our clients at may 31 2005 compared with 63 at may 31 2004 and 60 at may 31 2003 more than 95 of new clients purchase our tax filing and payment services and more than 75 of new clients purchase our employee 

16 payment services major market services revenues totaled 1777 million 1397 million and 1017 million for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this represents yearoveryear revenue growth of 27 for fiscal 2005 and 37 for fiscal 2004 approximately onethird of our new major market services clients are conversions from our core payroll service 

  the increases in human resource and benefits service revenues in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are primarily related to growth in the number of clients utilizing retirement services products growth in client employees for pas and peo services and the benefit of revenue from the april 2004 acquisition of stromberg time and attendance solutions 

  retirement services revenues totaled 914 million 784 million and 664 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively this represents yearoveryear revenue growth of 17 and 18 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 we serviced over 33000 and 29000 retirement services clients at may 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  pas is a combined package of services that include payroll employer compliance human resource and employee benefits administration and risk management outsourcing designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs our peo service provides primarily the same services as pas but with paychex acting as a coemployer of the client’s employees the peo service is available primarily in the states of florida and georgia where peos are more prevalent sales of the pas and peo products have been strong with administrative fee revenues from these services increasing 39 and 34 for fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively our pas and peo products serviced over 225000 and 157000 client employees as of may 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 and higher average portfolio balances offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of availableforsale securities the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2004 is the result of higher net realized gains on the sales of availableforsale securities and higher average portfolio balances offset by lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004 the higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were driven by organic client base growth and fiscal 2004 benefited from our acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal 2003 

  combined operating and sga expenses the following table summarizes total combined operating and selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the fiscal year ended may 31 

   combined operating and selling general and administrative expenses increased 10 in fiscal 2005 and 18 in fiscal 2004 excluding the expense charge to increase legal reserve these increases are primarily the result of our investments in personnel information technology and other costs to support organic growth and additional expenses as a result of our april 2004 acquisition of stromberg our acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal 2003 contributed to the increases in expenses in fiscal 2004 at may 31 2005 we had approximately 10000 employees compared with approximately 9400 at may 31 2004 and 8850 at may 31 2003 

17   depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software in addition to the impact from the 2003 acquisitions of businesses depreciation expense in fiscal 2004 was higher due in part to the purchase of a 220000squarefoot facility in rochester new york and the placement into service of our 300 million consolidated data center both of which occurred during the first half of fiscal 2003 amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from our fiscal 2003 acquisitions other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support our business 

  operating income operating income yearoveryear growth was 23 for fiscal 2005 and 8 for fiscal 2004 the increases in operating income in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are attributable to the factors previously discussed operating income growth in fiscal 2005 was impacted by the 358 million expense charge for the reserve for pending legal matters in fiscal 2004 net incremental peo revenue of 67 million in fiscal 2005 and 64 million in fiscal 2004 and 32 million of expense charges related to our captive insurance company in fiscal 2005 operating income exclusive of interest on funds held for clients and these unusual items increased approximately 15 for fiscal 2005 and approximately 17 in fiscal 2004 

  investment income net investment income net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale investment securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenues the decrease in investment income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is mainly due to lower net realized gains on the sales of availableforsale securities and lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 on longerterm investments offset by an increase in average daily invested balances the decrease in investment income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances lower average interest rates earned and lower net realized gains on the sales of availableforsale investments the decrease in average daily invested balances in fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund our advantage and interpay acquisitions in fiscal 2003 

  income taxes our effective income tax rate was 325 in fiscal 2005 compared with 326 in fiscal 2004 and 320 in fiscal 2003 the increase in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of lower levels of taxexempt income which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on income taxes 

  net income net income yearoveryear growth was 22 for fiscal 2005 and 3 for fiscal 2004 the increases in net income for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are attributable to the factors previously discussed 

liquidity and capital resources

   our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex and each of the financial institutions the “lenders” pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 

18 the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders under certain circumstances individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders

operating cash flow activities 

   the increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reflects higher net income adjusted for noncash items impacted by cash from working capital the increases in noncash adjustments to net income are primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization on fixed and intangible assets in fiscal 2004 noncash adjustments to net income were also impacted by 358 million in expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters the fluctuations in our working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection and timing of payments for compensation peo payroll income tax and other liabilities

  proceeds from exercise of stock options the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in the number of shares exercised the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to an increase in both the average exercise price per share and the number of shares exercised shares exercised in fiscal 2005 were 07 million compared with 13 million shares in fiscal 2004 and 08 million shares 

21 in fiscal 2003 we have recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 45 million 102 million and 55 million for fiscal 2005 fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively this tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paidin capital with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes see note g to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures on our stock option plans

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29” which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance the statement defines a nonmonetary exchange with commercial substance as one in which the future cash flows of an entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas no 153 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we will adopt this statement as required and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

  in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” fin 46r5 “implicit variable interests under fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities” fsp fin 46r5 provides guidance for a reporting enterprise that holds an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity “vie” and is also a related party to other variable interest holders this guidance requires that if the aggregate variable interests held by the reporting enterprise and its related parties would if held by a single party identify that party as the primary beneficiary then the party within the related party group that is most closely associated with the vie is the primary beneficiary the effective date of fsp fin 46r5 is the first reporting period beginning after march 3 2005 with early application permitted for periods for which financial statements have not been issued we do not believe that implementation of this fsp will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

  in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” which establishes unless impracticable retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle the statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable the statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of error by restating previously issued financial statements sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we will adopt this statement as required and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

22 critical accounting policies 

  note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience future expectations and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 

  revenue recognition service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period our service revenues are largely attributable to payrollrelated processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed the revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenues and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 

  peo revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred which include wages taxes benefit premiums and claims of peo worksite employees direct costs billed and incurred for peo worksite employees were 22308 million 18461 million and 14607 million for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  revenues from certain time and attendance solutions are recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists typically a noncancelable sales order delivery is complete for the software and hardware the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and collectibility is reasonably assured maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

  interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax filing and payment services and for employee payment services and invested until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees these collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt with some items extending to ninety days the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the consolidated statements of income because the collection holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of availableforsale securities 

  peo workers’ compensation insurance workers’ compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us these reserves include estimates for reported losses plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims in establishing the workers’ compensation insurance reserves we utilize an independent actuary we do not discount our reserves for workers’ compensation insurance claims 

  estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections and is subject to change due to multiple factors including social and economic trends changes in legal liability law and damage awards all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the financial statements accordingly final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 

23   we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers’ compensation insurance reserves adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary such adjustments could possibly be significant reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 

  in fiscal 2004 workers’ compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided under a prefunded deductible workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance company in fiscal 2005 the policy was no longer prefunded and claims were paid as incurred our maximum individual claims liability was 500000 under each of the fiscal 2004 and 2005 policies 

  we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers’ compensation claims as of may 31 

   valuation of investments our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity however changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis on our consolidated statements of income realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income net 

  we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in highcreditquality securities we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment we evaluate among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity our assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment 

  goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets such as customer lists certain license agreements trade names and noncompete agreements the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates judgments and assumptions for certain fixed assets including software and intangible assets we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

  we have 4060 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at may 31 2005 resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter our business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit based on the results of our goodwill impairment review no impairment charge was recognized in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004 subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 

24   we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

  accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations as part of providing payroll tax filing and payment services and employee payment services we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client’s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 

  contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 we recorded 92 million and 266 million respectively in expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters at may 31 2005 approximately 253 million of our reserve for pending legal matters remains based on the application of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated we deem this amount adequate the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter in light of the legal reserve recorded we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded for additional information regarding pending legal matters refer to note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this form 10k 

  income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we account for the tax benefit from the exercise of nonqualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paidin capital

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk factors 

  changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale debt securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale debt securities changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longerterm availableforsale investments we generally direct investments towards highcreditquality fixedrate municipal and government securities and manage the availableforsale portfolio to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 

  our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates the federal funds rate has increased to 300 as of may 31 2005 in the fiscal year ended may 31 2005 the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 22 compared with 18 for the same period last year shortterm interest rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2005 but longerterm rates on average were basically unchanged from the end of fiscal 2004 while shortterm and longterm interest rates generally move in the same direction there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship when interest rates begin to rise the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and shortterm interest rate changes as discussed below the federal funds rate decreased from 650 at the end of fiscal 2000 to 100 at may 31 2004 the decreasing interest rate environment experienced 

25 through fiscal 2004 negatively affected net income growth during most of fiscal 2004 and 2003 the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longerterm availableforsale portfolio during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 we mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sales of our investments 

  increases in interest rates increase earnings from our shortterm investments which totaled approximately 14 billion at may 31 2005 and over time will increase earnings from our longerterm availableforsale investments which totaled approximately 18 billion at may 31 2005 earnings from the availableforsaleinvestments which currently have an average duration of 21 years excluding the impact of auction rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates an increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio 

  the cost and fair value of availableforsale securities at may 31 2005 by contractual maturity are shown below expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 

   the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years 

   on june 30 2005 the federal funds rate was increased to 325 

  calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to daily interest rate changes seasonal variations in investment balances actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale investments the proportional mix of taxable and taxexempt investments and changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous subject to these factors a 25basispoint change generally affects our taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points 

  the total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments is expected to average approximately 38 billion in fiscal 2006 our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60 invested in shortterm securities with an average duration of thirty days and 40 invested in availableforsale municipal securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at the beginning of fiscal 2006 would be in the range of 37 million to 42 million for fiscal 2006 

26   the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized loss of 99 million at may 31 2005 compared with a net unrealized loss of 42 million at may 31 2004 and a net unrealized gain of 450 million at may 31 2003 during fiscal 2005 the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of 144 million to a net unrealized gain of 106 million during fiscal 2004 the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately 76 million net unrealized loss to 496 million net unrealized gain the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately 109 million at july 19 2005 see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures about our investment portfolios 

  as of may 31 2005 and may 31 2004 we had 18 billion and 19 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value with weightedaverage yields to maturity of 26 and 23 respectively assuming a hypothetical increase in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of securities at may 31 2005 would be in the range of 75 million to 80 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations 

  credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds we attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aarated securities and a1rated shortterm securities and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument at may 31 2005 all availableforsale and shortterm securities classified as cash equivalents held an a1 or equivalent rating with over 98 of availableforsale securities holding an aa rating or better

relationship with nebs® “new england business service inc” whereby paychex performs all client functions other than sales and marketing as part of the interpay acquisition fleet entered into a referral relationship with paychex 6   competition   the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented the company believes its primary national competitor adp® “automatic data processing” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue paychex competes with other national regional local and online service providers all of which have significantly smaller client bases   in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers the company competes with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors the company’s human resource and benefits products also compete with a variety of providers of unbundled human resource services such as retirement services companies insurance companies and human resources and benefits consulting firms   competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of product offering and price paychex believes it is competitive in each of these areas software maintenance and product development   the everchanging mandates of federal state and local taxing authorities require paychex to update the proprietary software utilized by the company to provide payroll and human resource and benefits services to its clients the company is continually engaged in developing enhancements and maintenance to its various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of its clients and the marketplace research and development expenses are not significant to the company’s overall results of operations employees   as of may 31 2004 the company employed approximately 9400 people none of the employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements intellectual property   the company owns or licenses and uses a number of trademarks trade names copyrights service marks trade secrets computer programs and software and other intellectual property rights taken as a whole the company’s intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of the company’s business where it is determined to be appropriate the company takes measures to protect its intellectual property rights including by way of example through confidentialitynondisclosure agreements or policies with employees vendors and others use of license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property and registration of certain trademarks paychex believes that the “paychex” name trademark and logo are of material importance to the company seasonality   there is no significant seasonality to the company’s business however during the company’s third fiscal quarter which ends in february the number of new payroll clients retirement services clients and new pas and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than in the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients start using services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services historically as a result of these factors the company’s total revenue has been slightly higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters with greater sales commission expenses also reported in these quarters risk factors   the company’s future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from 7   company projections important factors known to us that could cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those contained in the “safe harbor” statement at the beginning of this form 10k 

  the company may make errors and omissions in providing services processing tracking collecting and remitting client funds to the various taxing authorities client employees and other third parties are complex operations errors have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future these errors could include but are not limited to late filing with tax agencies underpayment of taxes and failure to comply with applicable banking regulations and laws relating to employee benefits administration which could result in significant penalties and liabilities that would adversely affect the company’s results of operations the company could also transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong amount and may be unable to correct the error or recover the funds resulting in a loss to the company   changes in government regulations and policies could adversely impact the business many of the company’s services particularly tax filing and payment services and benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continue to change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of the company’s services and substantially decrease its revenue added requirements could also increase the cost of doing business failure by the company to modify its services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have adverse effects on the company’s results of operations   failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions could harm the business as part of providing services to clients paychex relies on a number of thirdparty service providers these providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks which electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to company operations impact client relations and result in significant penalties or liabilities to the company   failure of the company’s business continuity plan in the event of a catastrophe could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations the company’s operations are dependent on its ability to protect its infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or similar event the company has a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events if the business continuity plan was unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario the company could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to its operations   integration of acquisitions the effective integration of acquired companies may be difficult to achieve it is also possible that the company may not realize any or all expected benefits from recent acquisitions or achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner in addition the company may incur significant costs and impact existing internal resources in connection with the integration of acquisitions failure to effectively integrate recent and future acquisitions could affect the company’s results of operations   legal matters the company is subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business these include disputes related to breach of contract employmentrelated claims intellectual property infringement and other matters in light of the legal reserve recorded the company’s management currently believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that their ultimate resolution could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 8     any of the above risk factors could cause damage to the company’s business reputation which is important to the company’s ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients other risk factors include the following   paychex clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments the company has made on their behalf to taxing authorities and employees as part of the payroll processing service paychex is authorized by its clients to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that the company would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them the company has in the past and may in the future make payments on its clients’ behalf for which it is not reimbursed resulting in a loss to the company   interest earned on funds held for clients could be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance the company receives interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to client employees a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact this interest income   stock price volatility the market price of the company’s common stock may be influenced by factors such as quarterly variations in operating results announcements of new services or technological innovations by the company or its competitors market conditions in the business process outsourcing industry changes in ratings or financial estimates by securities analysts general economic conditions fluctuations in the stock market that are not directly related to the company’s operating performance and other factors and events that are beyond the company’s control these and other factors can lead to fluctuations in the price of the company’s stock   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk refer to item 7a of this form 10k for discussion on market risk

2003 workers’ compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided under a prefunded deductible workers’ compensation policy with a national insurance company under this policy the company’s maximum individual claims liability was 250000 and the aggregate claims exposure was based on a percentage of premium rates as applied to workers’ compensation payroll   based on claims experience during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the company recorded approximately 64 million of net incremental peo revenue resulting from a refund of insurance premiums and a reduction in estimated claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 policy the fiscal 2004 policy is similar to the fiscal 2003 policy except that the company’s maximum individual claims liability is 500000 at may 31 2004 the

in investment income net   the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds the company attempts to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in highcreditquality securities the company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is otherthantemporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made in making this judgment the company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment and its ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity the company’s assessment that an investment is not otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company’s strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment   goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations paychex assigns estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets such as customer lists certain license agreements 15   trade names and noncompete agreements the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates judgments and assumptions for certain fixed assets including software and intangible assets the company utilizes the assistance of independent valuation consultants the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 

  the company has 4057 million of goodwill recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at may 31 2004 resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter the company’s business is largely homogeneous and as a result substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit based on the results of the company’s goodwill impairment review no impairment charge was recognized subsequent to this review there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the goodwill balance   the company also tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable   fixed assets the carrying value of fixed assets including costs for acquired software and software developed for internal use reflects estimates assumptions and judgments relative to capitalized costs useful lives utilization and salvage value for software developed for internal use all external direct costs for materials and services and certain payroll and related fringe costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of position sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” the company reviews the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable   accrual for client fund losses the company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated with its clients’ inability to meet their payroll obligations as part of providing payroll tax filing and payment services and employee payment services paychex is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client’s account for the amount of tax obligations and employees’ direct deposits electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients’ insufficient funds to cover such transfers the company evaluates certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients   contingent liabilities the company is subject to various claims and legal matters during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 the company recorded 92 million and 266 million respectively in expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters at may 31 2004 the company has recorded approximately 350 million in the reserve for pending legal matters based on the application of sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” which requires the company to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the company’s strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter in light of the legal reserve recorded the company’s management currently believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations however these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and the results of operations in the period in which

  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings furniture and fixtures data processing equipment and software in addition to the impact from the acquisitions depreciation expense in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was higher due in part to the purchase of a 220000squarefoot facility in rochester new york and the placement of a 30 million consolidated data center into service both of which occurred during the first half of fiscal 2003 amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from the acquisitions other expenses include items such as delivery forms and supplies communications travel and entertainment professional services and other costs incurred to support the business fiscal 2004’s expense growth was also impacted by higher legal and

include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenues the decrease in investment income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances lower average interest rates earned and lower net realized gains on the sale of availableforsale investments the decrease in investment income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances and lower average interest rates earned offset by higher net realized gains on the sale of availableforsale securities the decrease in average daily invested balances in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and higher net realized gains in fiscal 2003 are primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund the advantage and interpay acquisitions in fiscal 2003 the company estimates that yearoveryear reductions in investment income due to the use of corporate investments to fund the two acquisitions in fiscal 2003 were approximately 74 million and 76 million respectively in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003   income taxes the effective income tax rate was 326 in fiscal 2004 compared with 320 in fiscal 2003 and 305 in fiscal 2002 the increases in the effective income tax rate are primarily the result of lower levels of taxexempt income which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for

noncash items offset by cash used by working capital the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2003 is due to higher net income adjusted for noncash items and cash provided by working capital the

on the company’s future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors   proceeds from exercise of stock options the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to an increase in both the average exercise price per share and the number of shares exercised the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is due to a decrease in the number of shares exercised shares exercised in fiscal 2004 were 13 million compared with 8 million shares in fiscal 2003 and 22 million shares in fiscal 2002 the company has recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of 102 million 55 million and 241 million for fiscal 2004 fiscal 2003

its primary beneficiary which is the company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both for paychex the effective date for application of fin 46 to variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 was the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the company has investments in various

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk factors   changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale debt securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale debt securities changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of the company’s longerterm availableforsale investments the company generally directs investments towards highcreditquality fixedrate municipal and government securities and manages the availableforsale portfolio to a benchmark duration of two and onehalf to three years the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk   the company’s investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the decreasing interest rate environment as the federal funds rate decreased from 650 at the end of fiscal 2000 to 100 at may 31 2004 the decreasing interest rate environment has negatively affected net income growth in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 and generated significant unrealized gains for the company’s longerterm availableforsale portfolio during most of the same periods the company has mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sale of investments when interest rates begin to rise the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and shortterm interest rate changes as discussed below   increases in interest rates increase earnings from the company’s shortterm investments which totaled approximately 15 billion at may 31 2004 and over time will increase earnings from the company’s longerterm availableforsale investments which totaled approximately 14 billion at may 31 2004 earnings from the availableforsale investments which currently have an average duration of 21 years will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates an increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair value of the company’s investment portfolio 25     the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years    on june 29 2004 the federal funds rate was increased to 125   calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to daily interest rate changes seasonal variations in investment balances actual duration of shortterm and availableforsale investments the proportional mix of taxable and taxexempt investments and changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous subject to these factors a 25basispoint change generally affects the company’s taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points   the total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately 33 billion in fiscal 2005 the company’s normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60 invested in shortterm securities with an average duration of thirty days and 40 invested in availableforsale municipal securities with an average duration of two and onehalf to three years the company estimates that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at the beginning of fiscal 2005 would be in the range of 35 million to 40 million for fiscal 2005   the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized loss of 42 million at may 31 2004 compared with net unrealized gains of 450 million at may 31 2003 and 267 million at may 31 2002 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 interest rates on longerterm securities began to increase while shortterm rates remained fairly consistent the threeyear “aaa” municipal securities yield increased to 250 at may 31 2004 from 158 at february 29 2004 this trend in longerterm interest rates resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the company’s investment portfolios as the company’s 250 million net unrealized gain position at february 29 2004 changed to a 42 million net unrealized loss position at may 31 2004 during fiscal 2004 the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately 76 million net unrealized loss to 496 million net unrealized gain the range of unrealized gains in fiscal 2003 was 223 million to 497 million the net unrealized loss position of the company’s investment portfolios was approximately 3 million at july 14 2004 see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k for additional disclosures about the company’s investment portfolios   as of may 31 2004 and may 31 2003 the company had 14 billion invested in availableforsale securities at fair value with weighted average yields to maturity of 23 and 31 respectively assuming a hypothetical increase in both shortterm and longerterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at may 31 2004 would be in the range of 70 million to 75 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations   credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds the company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aarated securities and a1rated shortterm securities and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument at may 31 2004 all availableforsale and shortterm securities classified as cash equivalents held an a1 or equivalent rating with over 99 of availableforsale securities holding an aa rating or better 26

company’s new clients excluding acquisitions come from these referral sources the sales force for human resource and benefits products is primarily focused on selling products and services to existing payroll clients since their processed payroll information provides the data integration necessary to provide these services 5     the acquisitions of advantage and interpay provided paychex with additional sales channels advantage has license agreements with 15 independently owned associate offices which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage’s services and performing certain

relations and telemarketing programs the company has grown and expects to continue to grow its direct sales force in recent years the company has increased its emphasis on the selling of ancillary services to both new clients and its existing client base competition   the market for payroll processing services is highly fragmented the company believes its primary national competitor adp® “automatic data processing” is the largest us thirdparty provider of payroll processing in terms of revenue paychex competes with other national regional local and online service providers all of which have significantly smaller client bases   in addition to traditional payroll processing service providers the company competes with inhouse payroll and human resource systems and departments payroll and human resource systems are sold by many vendors the company’s human resource and benefits products also compete with a variety of providers of unbundled human resource services such as insurance companies retirement services companies and human resource consulting firms   competition in the payroll processing industry is primarily based on service responsiveness product quality and reputation breadth of product offering and price paychex believes it is competitive in each of these areas software maintenance and product development   the everchanging mandates of federal state and local taxing authorities require paychex to update the proprietary software utilized by the company to provide payroll and human resource and benefits services to its clients the company is continually engaged in developing enhancements and maintenance to its various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of its clients and the marketplace research and development expenses are not significant to the company’s overall results of operations employees   as of may 31 2003 the company employed approximately 8850 people none of the employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements trademarks   as of may 31 2003 the company and its subsidiaries had a number of trademarks and service marks filed for registration or registered with the us patent and trademark office including the names paychex taxpay paylink preview readychex payasyougo paychex online payroll rapid payroll advantage advantage payroll services advantage payroll instant payroll hr counselor advantage check interpay and exactpay the company believes these trademarks and service marks are important to its business 6   seasonality   there is no significant seasonality to the company’s business however during the company’s third fiscal quarter the number of new payroll clients retirement services clients and new pas and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than in the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients start using services in the beginning of a calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services as a result of these factors historically the company’s total revenue has been slightly higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters with greater sales commission expenses reported in the third quarter which ends in february risk factors   the company’s future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from company projections important factors known to us that could cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those contained in the “safe harbor” statement at the beginning of this form 10k   the company may make errors and omissions in providing services processing tracking collecting and remitting client funds to the various taxing authorities and client employees is complex errors have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future these errors could include late filing with tax agencies and underpayment of taxes which could result in significant penalties that would adversely affect the company’s results of operations the company could also transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong amount and may be unable to correct the error or recover the funds resulting in a loss to the company   changes in government policies could adversely impact the business many of the company’s services particularly tax filing and payment services and benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continue to change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required to or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of the company’s services and substantially decrease its revenue added requirements could also increase the cost of doing business failure by the company to modify its services in response to regulatory changes in a timely fashion could have adverse effects on the company’s results of operations   failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions could harm the business as part of providing services to clients paychex relies on a number of thirdparty service providers these providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks which electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in significant penalties for late tax payments and impact client relations   failure of the company’s business continuity plan in the event of a catastrophe could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations the company’s operations are dependent on its ability to protect its infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or similar event the company has a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events if the business continuity plan was unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario the company could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to its operations   integration of acquisitions the effective integration of acquired companies may be difficult to achieve it is also possible that the company may not realize any or all expected benefits from recent acquisitions or achieve benefits from acquisitions in a timely manner in addition the company may incur significant costs and impact existing internal resources in connection with the integration of acquisitions failure to effectively integrate recent and future acquisitions could affect the company’s results of operations 7     any of the above risk factors could cause damage to the company’s business reputation which is important to the company’s ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients   paychex clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments the company has made on their behalf to taxing authorities and employees as part of the payroll processing service paychex is authorized by its clients to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that the company would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them the company has in the past and may in the future make payments on its clients’ behalf for which it is not reimbursed resulting in a loss to the company   interest earned on funds held for clients could be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance the company receives interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to client employees interest on these funds is a substantial part of total revenue a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact this interest income   stock price volatility the market price of the company’s common stock may be influenced by factors such as quarterly variations in operating results announcements of new services or technological innovations by the company or its competitors market conditions in the business process outsourcing industry changes in ratings or financial estimates by securities analysts general economic conditions fluctuations in the stock market that are not directly related to the company’s operating performance and other factors and events which are beyond the

   as of may 31 2003 87 of all clients utilized the company’s tax filing and payment services compared with 85 at the end of 2002 and 83 at the end of 2001 the company believes the client utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is near maturity the company’s employee payment services were utilized by 60 of its clients at may 31 2003 compared with 57 at the end of 2002 and 53 at the end of 2001 more than 90 of new clients purchase the company’s tax filing and payment services and more than 70 of new clients purchase employee payment services major market services revenues totaled 1017 million 717 million and 474 million for fiscal years 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively this represents yearoveryear revenue growth of 42 for fiscal 2003 and 51 for fiscal 2002 approximately onethird of new major market services clients are conversions from the company’s core payroll service   the increases in human resource and benefits service revenues in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 are primarily related to increases in the number of clients utilizing retirement services products and increases in paychex administrative services pas and professional employer organization peo client employees serviced the increase in retirement services clients reflects the continuing interest of small to mediumsized businesses in offering retirement savings benefits to their employees retirement services revenues totaled 667 million 565 million and 433 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively this represents yearoveryear revenue growth of 18 for fiscal 2003 and 30 for fiscal 2002 the company serviced over 26000 and over 23000 retirement services clients at may 31 2003 and 2002 respectively   the paychex administrative services pas product is a combined package of payroll employer compliance employee benefit administration and risk management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for small businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs the company’s peo product provides primarily the same bundled services as the pas product but with paychex acting as a coemployer of the client’s employees the peo service is available primarily in the states of florida and georgia where peos are more prevalent sales of the pas and peo products have been strong with administrative fee revenues from these products increasing 40 and 41 for fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively the pas and peo products serviced over 103000 and over 80000 client employees as of may 31 2003 and 2002 respectively   the decline in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is the result of lower average interest rates earned and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of availableforsale securities offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances in fiscal 2002 interest on funds held for clients declined when compared to fiscal 2001 due to lower average interest rates earned offset by higher net realized gains and higher average portfolio balances the higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of advantage and interpay in fiscal 2003 and from the growth in the utilization of the company’s tax filing and payment services and employee payment services in both fiscal 2003 and 2002   the increase in consolidated operating selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 is due in part to the acquisitions of advantage and interpay the remaining increase in fiscal 2003 and the increase in fiscal 2002 are due to investments in personnel information technology and facility costs to support the organic growth of the company at may 31 2003 the company had approximately 8850 employees compared with approximately 7400 at the end of fiscal 2002   investment income net primarily represents earnings from the company’s cash and cash equivalents and investments in availableforsale investment securities investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenues the decrease in investment income in fiscal 2003 15   compared with fiscal 2002 is primarily due to a decrease in average daily invested balances and lower average interest rates earned offset by higher net realized gains on sales of availableforsale securities the increase in investment income in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 is primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of availableforsale securities and the increase in average daily invested balances offset by lower average interest rates earned the decrease in average daily invested balances and higher realized gains in fiscal 2003 are primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund the advantage and interpay acquisitions the company estimates the use of corporate investments to fund the two acquisitions reduced investment income by approximately 76 million in fiscal 2003 

  the effective income tax rate was 320 in fiscal 2003 compared with 305 in fiscal 2002 and 300 in fiscal 2001 the increases in the effective income tax rate are primarily the result of lower levels of taxexempt income which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios fiscal 2004’s effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 325   despite the impact of lower interest rates and difficult economic conditions income before taxes was 39 of total revenues during fiscal 2003 compared with 41 in fiscal 2002 and 42 in fiscal 2001 operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients increased 16 in fiscal 2003 and 19 in fiscal 2002 to 3480 million and 3010 million respectively outlook   the company has based its fiscal 2004 expectations on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes for fiscal 2004 the company projects payroll service revenue growth in the range of 15 to 17 reflecting the fullyear benefits of the acquisitions of advantage and interpay and human resource and benefits service revenue growth in the range of 21 to 23 total service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 16 to 18 the company expects interest on funds held for clients including realized gains to be flat in fiscal 2004 and corporate investment income to be down approximately 45 primarily due to the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions in fiscal 2003   taking the factors mentioned above into consideration the company anticipates achieving record total revenues and net income for fiscal 2004 total revenue growth is estimated to be in the range of 15 to 17 10 to 12 without advantage and interpay accompanied by net income growth of approximately 10 the impact of lower interest rates will continue to moderate yearoveryear growth in addition the company estimates that growth in operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients will be in the range of 15 to 20 for fiscal 2004 liquidity and capital resources   the company has historically funded its operations capital purchases purchases of corporate investments and dividend

as follows    at may 31 2003 the company had outstanding commitments to purchase 67 million of capital assets the company enters into various purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business operating activities    the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2003 reflects higher net income and cash provided by working capital operating cash flows in fiscal 2002 were comparable with fiscal 2001 as higher net income was offset by higher uses of working capital the fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of payments for payrollrelated income tax and other liabilities and the timing of payments for peo and pas payroll liabilities investing activities    funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale debt securities corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale debt securities the portfolio of funds held

upon the timing of collecting client funds and the related remittance of funds to tax authorities for tax filing and payment service clients and employees of clients utilizing employee payment

dependent on the company’s future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors   proceeds from exercise of stock options the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2003 is primarily due to the decrease in number of shares exercised the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2002 is due to an increase in the number of shares exercised and an increase in the comparable average exercise price per share shares exercised in fiscal 2003 were 839000 compared with 2212000 shares in fiscal 2002 and 1878000

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk factors   interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale debt securities whereas corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale debt securities the company’s availableforsale debt securities are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held investments and the earnings potential of future investments increases in interest rates normally decrease the market value of the availableforsale securities while decreases in interest rates increase the market value of the availableforsale securities the company’s availableforsale securities and shortterm funds are exposed to earnings risk from changes in interest rates as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments increases in interest rates quickly increase earnings from shortterm funds and over time increase earnings from the availableforsale securities portfolio decreases in interest rates have the opposite earnings effect on the availableforsale securities and shortterm funds earnings from the availableforsale securities do not reflect changes in rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at current rates the immediate impact of changing interest rates on earnings from shortterm funds may be temporarily offset by realized gains or losses from transactions in the company’s availableforsale portfolio 19     the company directs investments towards high creditquality taxexempt securities to mitigate the risk that earnings from the portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates in the near term the company invests in short to intermediateterm fixedrate municipal and government securities which typically have lower interest rate volatility and normally manages the securities portfolio to a benchmark duration of 25 to 30 years the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk   the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the last three fiscal years    on june 25 2003 the federal funds rate was decreased by 25 to 100   calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to daily interest rate changes seasonal variations in investment balances actual duration of shortand intermediateterm investments the proportional mix of taxable and taxexempt investments and changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous subject to these factors a 25basispoint change generally affects the company’s taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points   the total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately 290 billion in fiscal 2004 the company’s normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities with a duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in intermediateterm

and rapid payroll the company believes these trademarks and service marks are important to its business seasonality there is no significant seasonality to the company’s business however during the company’s third fiscal quarter the number of new payroll clients retirement services clients and new pas and peo worksite employees tends to be higher than in the rest of the fiscal year primarily because a majority of new clients start using services in the beginning of the calendar year in addition calendar yearend transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during the third fiscal quarter due to clients paying yearend bonuses and requesting additional yearend services as a result of these factors historically the company’s total revenue has been slightly higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters with greater sales commission expenses reported in the third quarter which ends in february 7 risk factors the company’s future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results and from company projections important factors known to us that could cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and those contained in the “safe harbor” statement at the beginning of this form 10k the company may make errors and omissions in providing services processing tracking collecting and remitting client funds to the various taxing authorities and client employees is complex errors have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future these errors could include late filing with tax agencies and underpayment of taxes which could result in significant penalties that would adversely affect the company’s results of operations the company could also transfer funds in error to an incorrect party or for the wrong amount and may be unable to correct the error or recover the funds resulting in a loss to the company changes in government policies could adversely impact the business many of the company’s services particularly tax filing and benefit plan administration services are designed according to government regulations that continue to change changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required or may choose to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of the company’s services and substantially decrease its revenue added requirements could also increase the cost of doing business failure by the company to modify its services in response to regulatory changes in a timely fashion could have adverse effects on the company’s results of operations failure of thirdparty service providers to perform their functions could harm the business as part of providing services to clients paychex relies on a number of thirdparty service providers these providers include but are not limited to couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks which electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees failure by these providers for any reason to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in significant penalties for late tax payments and impact client relations failure of the company’s business continuity plan in the event of a catastrophe could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations the company’s operations are dependent on its ability to protect its infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster security breach power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attack or similar event the company has a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events if the business continuity plan was unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario the company could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to its operations any of the above risk factors could cause damage to the company’s business reputation which is important to the company’s ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients paychex clients could have insufficient funds to cover payments the company has made on their behalf to taxing authorities and employees as part of the payroll processing service paychex is authorized by its clients to transfer money from their accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and various taxing authorities it is possible that the company would be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them the company has in the past and may in the future make payments on its clients’ behalf for which it is not reimbursed resulting in a loss to the company interest earned on funds held for clients could be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance the company receives interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to clients’ employees interest on these funds is a substantial part of total revenue a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact this interest income

investment income net does not include interest on funds held for clients which is included in total revenues the increases in investment income net in fiscal 2002 and 2001 are primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of availableforsale securities and the increase in average daily invested balances the increase for fiscal 2002 was offset by lower average interest rates compared with fiscal 2001 the increase for fiscal 2001 reflected the benefit of higher average interest rates compared with fiscal 2000 the effective income tax rate was 305 in fiscal 2002 compared with 300 in fiscal 2001 and 310 in fiscal 2000 fiscal 2003’s effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 310 economic conditions and outlook the company began to experience the effects of the economic recession in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and these effects continued throughout the fiscal year in response to the declining economic conditions the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate eleven times since january 2001 to 175 which represents a cumulative 475 basis point reduction yearoveryear comparisons for interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income combined were down 15 in fiscal 2002 but 15 were up 47 and 16 in fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively the impact of the rate cuts on yearoveryear comparisons for interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income was more significant in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002 in addition to the effects of volatile interest rates the impact of a recessionary economy has resulted in a lower number of checks per client as existing clients reduce their work forces for fiscal 2002 checks per client declined 37 yearoveryear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 the company experienced a 30 decline in checks per client compared to 48 in the third quarter 43 in the second quarter and 26 in the first quarter during the recession of the early 1990’s the company experienced a total reduction in checks per client of approximately 3 despite the above factors income before taxes remained strong at 41 of total revenues during fiscal 2002 compared with 42 in fiscal 2001 and 38 in fiscal 2000 in addition the company continued to leverage its infrastructure as operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients as a percentage of total service revenues was 34 in fiscal 2002 compared with 32 in fiscal 2001 and 30 in fiscal 2000 the company estimates that if the interest rates and checks per client conditions experienced in fiscal 2000 had continued throughout fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 net income growth for fiscal 2001 would have been approximately 25 compared with actual growth of 34 and net income growth for fiscal 2002 would have been approximately 20

operating activities  operating cash flows in fiscal 2002 were comparable with fiscal 2001 as higher net income was offset by higher uses of working capital the higher use of working capital was related primarily to the timing of payments for payrollrelated income tax and other liabilities and timing of payments for peo and pas payroll liabilities the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to higher net income investing activities  funds held for clients and corporate investments funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of shortterm funds and availableforsale debt securities whereas corporate investments are primarily comprised of availableforsale debt securities the company’s availableforsale debt securities are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held investments and the earnings potential of future investments increases in interest rates normally decrease the market value of the availableforsale securities while decreases in interest rates increase the market value of the availableforsale securities the company’s availableforsale securities and shortterm funds are exposed to earnings risk from changes in interest rates as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments increases in interest rates quickly increase earnings from shortterm funds and over time increase earnings from the availableforsale securities portfolio decreases in interest rates have the opposite earnings effect on the availableforsale securities and shortterm funds earnings from the availableforsale securities do not reflect changes in rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at current rates the immediate impact of changing interest rates on earnings from shortterm funds may be temporarily offset by realized gains or losses from transactions in the company’s availableforsale portfolio the company directs investments towards high creditquality taxexempt securities to mitigate the risk that earnings from the portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates in the near term the company invests in short to intermediateterm fixedrate municipal and government securities which typically have lower interest rate volatility and normally manages the securities portfolio to a benchmark duration of 25 to 30 years the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk the trend in market interest rates during the second half of fiscal 2001 and the first half of fiscal 2002 has been interest rate reductions the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the last three fiscal years  19 calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors these factors include but are not limited to daily interest rate changes seasonal variations in investment balances actual duration of short and intermediateterm investments the proportional mix of taxable and taxexempt investments and changes in taxexempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates which are not synchronized or simultaneous subject to these factors a 25basispoint change generally affects the company’s taxexempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points the total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately 285 billion in fiscal 2003 the company’s normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 50 invested in shortterm securities with a duration of less than 30 days and 50 invested in intermediateterm municipal securities with an average duration of three years the company estimates that the earnings effect of a 25basispoint change in interest rates 17 basis points for taxexempt investments at this point in time would be approximately 30 million for fiscal 2003 the combined funds held for clients and corporate availableforsale investment portfolios reflected unrealized gains of 267 million at may 31 2002 and 205 million at may 31 2001 compared with unrealized losses of 134 million at may 31 2000 during fiscal 2002 the unrealized gain position ranged from approximately 75 million during the fourth quarter to 359 million during the second quarter as of may 31 2002 and may 31 2001 the company had 15 billion and 13 billion respectively invested in availableforsale securities at fair value with weighted average yields to maturity of 36 and 43 respectively assuming a hypothetical increase in both shortterm and intermediateterm interest rates of 25 basis points the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at may 31 2002 would be approximately 85 million conversely a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value this hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio’s recorded value with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders’ equity and with no related or immediate impact to the results of operations credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds the company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aa rated securities and a1 rated shortterm securities and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument at may 31 2002 approximately 98 of the availableforsale securities held an aa rating or better and all shortterm securities classified as cash equivalents held an a1 or equivalent rating 20
